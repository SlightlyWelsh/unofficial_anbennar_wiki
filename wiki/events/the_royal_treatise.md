The weight of this outcome is 20
 - Multiplied by 4 if has check variable has which is BirsartansesPlanFailChance, and check variable has value is 40; and does not have check variable has which is BirsartansesPlanFailChance, and check variable has value is 50

The weight of this outcome is 20
 - Multiplied by 3 if has check variable has which is BirsartansesPlanFailChance, and check variable has value is 30; and does not have check variable has which is BirsartansesPlanFailChance, and check variable has value is 40

The weight of this outcome is 20
 - Multiplied by 2 if has check variable has which is BirsartansesPlanFailChance, and check variable has value is 20; and does not have check variable has which is BirsartansesPlanFailChance, and check variable has value is 30
