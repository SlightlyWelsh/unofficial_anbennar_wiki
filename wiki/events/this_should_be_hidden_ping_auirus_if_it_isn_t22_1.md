###AI weighting:
AI weights this option at 5


###One of the following randomly happens:
Outcome 1:

The weight of this outcome is 40
 - Multiplied by 0 if has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 1000

The weight of this outcome is 40
 - Multiplied by 0.8 if has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 600

This outcome causes the following effects:<ul><li>If does not have check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 1000:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = incursion_gathering_strength</li><li>value = 200</li></ul><li>If has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 1100:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = incursion_gathering_strength</li><li>value = 1000</li></ul></ul></ul><li>seghdihr calculate incursion strength = yes</li></ul>
Outcome 2:

The weight of this outcome is 60
 - Multiplied by 1.1 if has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 200

The weight of this outcome is 60
 - Multiplied by 1.1 if has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 400

The weight of this outcome is 60
 - Multiplied by 1.2 if has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 600

The weight of this outcome is 60
 - Multiplied by 1.2 if has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 800

The weight of this outcome is 60
 - Multiplied by 1.5 if has check variable has which is incursion gathering strength, and check variable has value is 1000
