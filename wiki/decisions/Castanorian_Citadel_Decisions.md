| <a name="rebuild_Bal_Mire">Rebuild Bal Mire</a><br />*The ancient Castanorian citadel of Bal Mire stood as the sole guardian of the civilized heartlands of Castan's Empire against the barbarian scourge of the Alenic peoples. It fell during the Dragonwake when Zaamalot the Black razed it to the ground and made it his lair, but now it lies in ruins and haunted by ghosts of the past. Let us restore it to its former glory!* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>the event [Rebuilding Bal Mire](../events/rebuilding_bal_mire.md) happens</li> | <li>owns core province 229</li><li>229:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_castanorian_citadel</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier rebuilding_castanorian_citadel</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="rebuild_North_Citadel">Rebuild the North Citadel</a><br />*The ancient North Citadel was the gateway to the Trials of Castan and where the rulers of Castan's eponymous empire held court. Left in ruins after the Dragonwake destroyed the grand aqueduct connecting the North Citadel to Castonath, its current state is a stark reminder of decay and ruination. Let us restore it to its former glory!* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>the event [Rebuilding the North Citadel](../events/rebuilding_the_north_citadel.md) happens</li> | <li>owns core province 840</li><li>840:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_castanorian_citadel</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier rebuilding_castanorian_citadel</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="rebuild_Bal_Dostan">Rebuild Bal Dostan</a><br />*The ancient Castanorian citadel of Bal Dostan was once the center of the old kingdom of Dostanor, and more recently the capital of the Kingdom of Corvuria under the name Arca Corvur. It valiantly held off the Greentide and spared the lands behind it from the same fate as the rest of Escann, but was ruined in the process. The time to restore these walls has come, so that it may protect the surrounding lands once again!* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>the event [Rebuilding Bal Dostan](../events/rebuilding_bal_dostan.md) happens</li> | <li>owns core province 441</li><li>441:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_castanorian_citadel</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier rebuilding_castanorian_citadel</li></ul></ul> |
