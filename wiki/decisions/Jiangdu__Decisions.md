| <a name="command_city_1">Upgrade Command City: Jiangdu</a><br />*Our Capital.\n\nThe most deserving city of this honor. Plans to make Jiangdu more than a regular metropolis have existed for years. Now, the leaders of our nation have begun preparations to make this into a reality. If you, the honorable ruler of Jiangdu, decides to pass legislation to begin these plans, we can do so much more.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>owns core province 4868</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>treasury is at least 350</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add treasury = -350</li><li>4868:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = jiangdu_command_city</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_command_city_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Y13</li><li>Country was Y13</li></ul><li>has country flag [jiangdu_success_decisions](../flags/jiangdu_success_decisions.md)</li><li>4868:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city_1</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="command_city_2">Upgrade Command City: Tianlou</a><br />*Tianlou is considered to be the greatest city along the Yanhe, and while we hate to admit it, it rightfully deserves such a title. The amount of cash and wealth the city brings in for the country of Tianlou is insane. Fortunately for us, Tianlou is under new leadership. To keep rebellion from starting in the city, and for the city to keep its fame, it may be wise to invest in plans for a new command city, one that shall keep Tianlou in check, and load our coffers with profit.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>owns core province 4871</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>treasury is at least 350</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add treasury = -350</li><li>4871:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = jiangdu_command_city</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_command_city_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Y13</li><li>Country was Y13</li></ul><li>has country flag [jiangdu_success_decisions](../flags/jiangdu_success_decisions.md)</li><li>4871:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city_2</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="command_city_3">Upgrade Command City: Bianfang</a><br />*Bianfang was the city of our rivals, Bianfang. They were a country to be feared, and had their own high military administrative standards. When we conquered the city, we made sure to treat the leaders and people of the city with the same respect.\n\nUnfortunately, Bianfang as a whole is a huge area of united people, a grand accomplishment from the original leaders of the land. Now, we will have to do the same, by turning Bianfang into a center of unity instead of rebellion. A new command city is in our midst.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>owns core province 4826</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>treasury is at least 350</li><li>4826:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_western_outpost</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add treasury = -350</li><li>4826:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = jiangdu_western_outpost</li><li>remove province modifier = jiangdu_command_city</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_command_city_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Y13</li><li>Country was Y13</li></ul><li>has country flag [jiangdu_success_decisions](../flags/jiangdu_success_decisions.md)</li><li>4826:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city_3</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="command_city_4">Upgrade Command City: Yanzhong</a><br />*Yanzhong is one of the bigger cities in Yanshen. Its important location in the middle of Yanshen and connecting to the Yanhe means it is a great position for expanding our influence. We will have to make sure the people of this land will stick with us before we make any rash decisions. Middle Yanshen is fairly divided.\n\nMany have suggested a new command city to be built in Yanzhong, and have brought the idea to you. The choice is yours...* | <li>is not at war</li><li>owns core province 4859</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>treasury is at least 350</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add treasury = -350</li><li>4859:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = jiangdu_command_city</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_command_city_4</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Y13</li><li>Country was Y13</li></ul><li>has country flag [jiangdu_success_decisions](../flags/jiangdu_success_decisions.md)</li><li>4859:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier jiangdu_command_city_4</li></ul></ul> |
