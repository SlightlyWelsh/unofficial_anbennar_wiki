| <a name="form_udzenklan">Form The Allclan</a><br />*Having proven our might and united all cave goblin clans existing in the Western Dwarovar, we have declared all clans to be abrogated aside from Ves Udzenklan, the clan of all. The time has come to abandon petty rivalries and focus on progress for the goblin race. Though such a radical restructuring may no doubt rankle powerful and weak alike, the might and wealth at our disposal is enough to allay such concerns. This is truly a historic moment in our people's history. There is no way this can end badly for us. The mountains are ours! For the future!

| <a name="form_zarjiplaj">Form the Underkingdom</a><br />*Our shamans recount a story of millennia ago, where both goblins and dwarves lived in the Tree of Stone in perpetual conflict. The rapacious greed of the dwarves caused them to drive out goblinkind, pushing our people ever further west as the dwarves sought the riches of the Serpentspine. Now, through conquest, diplomacy, and grit we have secured the Tree of Stone and for the first time in thousands of years our people can dwell in the homeland without fear of dwarven axe or orcish marauder. But there is a threat on the horizon. The hobgoblins, goblinoids blessed with stronger forms and cursed with an unimaginative discipline. Now that we have united the Tree of Stone, the Command is no longer the unchallenged ruler of the eastern mountains.\n\nWhatever our previous stance with them, it is without a doubt that the militaristic hobgoblins will see us a target for conquest now that we represent a challenge to their might.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>is not a nomad</li><li>government is monarchy</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Zarjiplaj</li></ul><li>owns core province 4265</li><li>owns core province  4284</li><li>Province 4271 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li><li>owns or subject of  4280</li><li>owns or subject of   4274</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 45</li><li>superregion is east_serpentspine_superregion</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>superregion is rahen_superregion</li></ul></ul><li>special formation trigger is yes</li> | <li>change tag = I99</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>If every subject country has tag is H88, and has tag is H92, and has tag is H93:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>inherit = PREV</li></ul></ul><li>add historical rival = R62</li><li>R62:</li><ul><li>add historical rival = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>If has was tag is H93, and has was tag is H92, and has was tag is H88:</li><ul><li>override country name = UDZEN_TROICE</li></ul><li>Else if has was tag is H74:</li><ul><li>override country name = DAKAZ_CARZVIYA</li></ul><li>Else if does not have was tag is H93, and does not have was tag is H92, and does not have was tag is H88, and does not have was tag is H74:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul></ul><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>add government reform = underkingdom_reform</li> | <li>primary culture is undergrowth_goblin</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Ves Udzenklan</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>Country is Zarjiplaj</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Ves Udzenklan</li></ul></ul><li>is not colonial nation</li><li>OR:</li><ul><li>is not former colonial nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is former colonial nation</li><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
