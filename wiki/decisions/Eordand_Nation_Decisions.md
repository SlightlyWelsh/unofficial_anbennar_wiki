| <a name="eordand_nation">Unite the Seasons</a><br />*Splintered amongst the four seasons of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, Eordand has never been unified. However, with the shifts of the winds, and with strange events happening in lands far away, it is time to unite the five peoples into under one banner: Eordand!* | <li>adm tech is at least 7</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>is not a nomad</li><li>is not at war</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 2007</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  2159</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of   2037</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of    1775</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of     2022</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of      2049</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of       1969</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of        1965</li> | <li>change tag = H21</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>If has reform is monastic order reform:</li><ul><li>add government reform = leading_clergy_reform</li></ul><li>If does not have government rank is 3:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 3</li></ul><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>If eordand superregion does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = H21</li></ul><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>add prestige = 50</li><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set country flag [formed_eordand_flag](../flags/formed_eordand_flag.md)</li><li>the event [Direction of Eordand](../events/direction_of_eordand.md) happens</li><li>the event [The Center of Power](../events/the_center_of_power.md) happens</li> | <li>culture group is eordan_ruinborn_elf</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_eordand_flag](../flags/formed_eordand_flag.md)</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Eordand</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is not former colonial nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is former colonial nation</li><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li> |
| <a name="eordand_arakeprun">Renovate Arakeprun</a><br />*The internal conflicts between the Eordan unfortuneatly lead to the decline in Arakeprun, the greatest city in Eordand. Built upon relatively intact Precursor ruins, and restored using the combined knowledge and power of the artifacts they have left behind for us, Arakeprun was once a shining symbol of rebirth. But where it's academical temples have rediscovered lore lost to time, the city itself has decayed. Hoarding it all for research, the Precursor relics that rebuilt the city have not been availabe to maintain the city, and with the Goldtree Rebellion cutting Arakeprun off from their primary excavation sites the problem has only festered. With Eordand united, there is no excuse: Arakeprun must be restored and renovated beyond even it's former glory!* | <li>owns core province 2007</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is controlled by the AI</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>treasury is at least 1000</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>2007:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = arakeprun_precursor_tool_deprivation</li></ul><li>add prestige = 10</li> | <li>Country is Eordand</li><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>owns core province 2007</li><li>2007:</li><ul><li>has province modifier arakeprun_precursor_tool_deprivation</li></ul> |
