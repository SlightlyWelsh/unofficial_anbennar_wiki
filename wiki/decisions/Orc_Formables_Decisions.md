| <a name="grombar_nation">Form Grombar</a><br />*Our land is barren and poor, where survivors are not just the strongest, but the most adaptable. The orcish tribes of the Alenic Reach are disunited and weak, threatened by Gerudians and Reachmen. We managed to gather many weaker orc tribes under our rule, and it is the right time to make our distinctions disappear. We are no longer Frozenmaws or Broken Jaws. Now we are orcs of Grombar, State of the Gray People.* | <li>has institution feudalism</li><li>is not at war</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>superregion is gerudia_superregion</li></ul><li>adm tech is at least 7</li> | <li>change tag = Z50</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>If has culture group is orcish:</li><ul><li>change primary culture = gray_orc</li></ul><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier "legacy_of_greentide_invaders_modifier" for 40 years</li><li>set country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li><li>clr country flag [knightly_order_adventurer](../flags/knightly_order_adventurer.md)</li><li>the event [Direction of Our New Country](../events/direction_of_our_new_country.md) happens</li><li>If does not have custom ideas, and does not have tag is Z18, and does not have was tag is Z18:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>set country flag [formed_grombar_nation](../flags/formed_grombar_nation.md)</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is gray_orc</li><li>primary culture  is half_orc</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Grombar</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
| <a name="khozrugan_nation">Form Khozrugan</a><br />*When Korgus led us to the surface, nobody had any idea what it would be like. So green, so bright, so... rich and easy to conquer. Korgus crushed Castellyr and other Escanni kingdoms easily, only to be stopped by Corin. The great army of the Dookanson crumbled into small clans, as it was before the Greentide. But now we have managed to unite orcs of West Castanor under our banner. But times have changed, and humans are aware of the power of orcs. To crush them we need to adapt, to become more like them, but stronger. We need to become a proper nation... the strongest nation Cannor has ever seen.* | <li>has institution feudalism</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm tech is at least 8</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is great_dookan</li></ul></ul><li>is not at war</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>region is west_castanor_region</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>government is native</li></ul> | <li>change tag = Z51</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>change primary culture = green_orc</li><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier "legacy_of_greentide_invaders_modifier" for 40 years</li><li>set country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li><li>clr country flag [knightly_order_adventurer](../flags/knightly_order_adventurer.md)</li><li>the event [Direction of Our New Country](../events/direction_of_our_new_country.md) happens</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>set country flag [formed_khozrugan_nation](../flags/formed_khozrugan_nation.md)</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is green_orc</li><li>primary culture  is gray_orc</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Khozrugan</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>religion is great_dookan</li><li>religion  is corinite</li><li>religion   is regent_court</li></ul><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
| <a name="unguldavor_nation">Form Unguldavor</a><br />*When Korgus died, we felt like we woke from a nightmare. Countless orcs, sons and fathers, lost their lives for the Dookanson's ambitions. Now, when he is gone, we are finally free to choose our way to live. The lands of the former kingdom of Castellyr are rich and they are more than enough to feed our people. The forests of Inner Castanor are deep and will help us protect ourselves from invaders, no matter who they are - orcs or humans. That is why our land will be called Unguldavor, Wall of Forests.* | <li>has institution feudalism</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm tech is at least 8</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is great_dookan</li></ul></ul><li>is not at war</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>region is inner_castanor_region</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>government is native</li></ul> | <li>change tag = Z52</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>change primary culture = green_orc</li><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier "legacy_of_greentide_invaders_modifier" for 40 years</li><li>set country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li><li>clr country flag [knightly_order_adventurer](../flags/knightly_order_adventurer.md)</li><li>the event [Direction of Our New Country](../events/direction_of_our_new_country.md) happens</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>set country flag [formed_unguldavor_nation](../flags/formed_unguldavor_nation.md)</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is green_orc</li><li>primary culture  is gray_orc</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Unguldavor</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>region is inner_castanor_region</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>religion is great_dookan</li><li>religion  is corinite</li><li>religion   is regent_court</li></ul><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
| <a name="barumand_nation">Form Barumand</a><br />*We understand why the Escanni people fought so desperately for these lands. The green fields are beautiful, the soil of is fertile and the forests are filled with game. Yet now we own this land and we have full right to call it our new home. Barumand, the Prosperous, will unite all orcs of Southern Escann.

| <a name="found_karashar">Found Karashar</a><br />*Like the Dookanson, we have abandoned Serpentspine caves for fights and glory on the surface, although we chose to invade the drylands of Bulwar instead of the kingdoms of Escann. We have managed to crush the resistance of several kingdoms and have gained a foothold in Bulwar.\n\nHowever, now we face a new problem: a strange cult is growing in popularity among our orcs — a cult of Forgiveness, based on local Bulwari beliefs in Surakel. Many tribesmen claim that we were called here not by the will of Dookan, but by Surakel, who begged orcs to liberate His human children from elven lies and gnollish chains. These cultists claim that although we creatures were born from the Darkness, by freeing the Bulwari people and fulfilling the will of Surakel, we can gain forgiveness in His eyes and be accepted among His children.\n\nPriests of this cult now demand our $MONARCHTITLE$ found the city of Karashar, the city of the Black Sun, from where we will be able to rule Bulwar as 'Surakel wants'.* | <li>has institution feudalism</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>adm tech is at least 7</li><li>stability is at least 2</li></ul><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>is not at war</li><li>total own and non tributary subject development is at least 100</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul> | <li>If does not have religion is old bulwari sun cult:</li><ul><li>add stability = -5</li></ul><li>change tag = Z57</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>change primary culture = karashari_orc</li><li>change religion = old_bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is black orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = karashari_orc</li><li>change religion = old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul></ul><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>set country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li><li>clr country flag [knightly_order_adventurer](../flags/knightly_order_adventurer.md)</li><li>the event [A Black Sun Looms Over Bulwar](../events/a_black_sun_looms_over_bulwar.md) happens</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>set country flag [founded_karashar](../flags/founded_karashar.md)</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Karashar"</li><li>rename capital = "Karashar"</li><li>change culture = karashari_orc</li><li>change religion = old_bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>set province flag [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md)</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Missing localisation: orcform_4_t](../events/missing_localisation_orcform_4_t.md) happens</li></ul> | <li>primary culture is black_orc</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Karashar</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [orc_nation_formed](../flags/orc_nation_formed.md)</li></ul><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has reform roadwarrior_great_convoy</li></ul> |
| <a name="orc_change_religion_corinite">Embrace Corinite Faith</a><br />*Great Dookan created our race to avenge the wrongs wrought upon him by the gods and their children. Yet we failed. We were stopped by a single human woman, Corin, who managed to defeat Korgus Dookanson, champion of our god and our leader. After many years on the surface, in contact with other races and faiths we started to doubt our ways. The Great Dookan teaches that the strongest must rule, and Corin defeated him... so maybe we should follow the strongest?* | <li>stability is at least 2</li> | <li>add stability = -3</li><li>change religion = corinite</li><li>country gets the modifier "orc_conversion_zeal" for 25 years</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>change religion = corinite</li></ul><li>If has country flag is [removing_monstrous](../flags/removing_monstrous.md):</li><ul><li>decrease monstrous 10 = yes</li></ul> | <li>culture group is orcish</li><li>religion is great_dookan</li><li>is religion enabled is corinite</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>is not force converted</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul> |
