| <a name="heirs_of_bhengudak">Heirs of Bhengudak</a><br />*Long ago the Great Kusheng Bhengudak conquered the kingdom of Odheongu in the east, ushering in the mighty empire of Guwaamud, which would stand for nearly 900 years before it was torn down by their disloyal subjects. We have since repeated Bhengudak's grand feat, crushing the Odheongun and not only returning to Bhengudak's capital, but once again laying claim to the fallen capital of Odheongu. With such great successes, we can now rightfully declare ourselves the sovereigns of Guwaamud, heirs to the glory of Bhengudak!* | <li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>is not at war</li><li>does not have regency</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y96</li></ul><li>total development is at least 140</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 12</li><li>region is odheongu_region</li></ul><li>owns core province 5348</li><li>owns 5355</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has ruler modifier faceless_queen_modifier</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [formed_guwaamud_flag](../flags/formed_guwaamud_flag.md)</li><li>set ruler flag [guwaamud_former](../flags/guwaamud_former.md)</li><li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y91_guwaamud_fomer_mod</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change tag = Y96</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>If has primary culture is chimbija:</li><ul><li>override country name = GUNGAMU</li></ul><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If does not have government rank is 2:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 2</li></ul><li>change government = monarchy</li><li>add government reform = guwaamud_harem_reform</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>If does not have primary culture is chimbija:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = Our Horde Heritage will lessen.</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Y91_horde_heritage_1 until otherwise removed</li></ul></ul><li>jaddempire move court minorities from to:</li><ul><li>from = capital_scope</li><li>province id = 5348</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>jaddempire move court minorities from to:</li><ul><li>from = 5406</li><li>province id = 5348</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have primary culture is chimbija:</li><ul><li>5348:</li><ul><li>move capital effect = yes</li><li>change culture = shuvuush</li><li>change province name = "Bhengutai"</li></ul></ul><li>If odheongu region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Y98</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_guwaamud_flag](../flags/formed_guwaamud_flag.md)</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is shuvuush</li><li>primary culture  is guwaadun</li><li>primary culture   is chimbija</li></ul><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
| <a name="the_great_empire">The Great Empire</a><br />*The Yan have long looked down on our people, haughtily dismissing us as savages from the decadent opulence of their cities and confident in the security of their walls. How they must be reeling now that our hordes have overrun their most important cities, our banners flying proud over their markets and palaces. Our time in this land has changed us however, with many of our people adopting the traditions and culture of the Yan; our warlords wear Yansheni silk and many speak the native language as their tongue of birth. It is time for us to accept the winds of change and establish a grand empire that shall finally unify all of Yanshen under a single throne.* | <li>is not subject</li><li>is not at war</li><li>does not have regency</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y98</li></ul><li>adm tech is at least 7</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 100</li><li>superregion is yanshen_superregion</li></ul><li>owns core province 4925</li><li>owns core province  4859</li><li>owns core province   4879</li><li>owns core province    4871</li><li>owns core province     4868</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has ruler modifier faceless_queen_modifier</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is not_guwaamud_former</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has ruler flag [guwaamud_former](../flags/guwaamud_former.md)</li></ul></ul> | <li>change tag = Y98</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>set country flag [formed_daxugo_flag](../flags/formed_daxugo_flag.md)</li><li>set ruler flag [daxugo_former](../flags/daxugo_former.md)</li><li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y91_daxugo_fomer_mod</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>change government = monarchy</li><li>If does not have reform is guwaamud harem reform:</li><ul><li>add government reform = autocracy_reform</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has country modifier is Y91 horde heritage 1:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = Y91_horde_heritage_1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = Our Horde Heritage will lessen.</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Y91_horde_heritage_2 until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If yanshen superregion does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have technology group is tech halessi:</li><ul><li>change technology group = tech_halessi</li></ul><li>If does not have unit type is tech halessi:</li><ul><li>change unit type = tech_halessi</li></ul><li>change primary culture = daxug</li><li>set ruler culture = daxug</li><li>set heir culture = daxug</li><li>If does not have government rank is 3:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 3</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is shuvuush:</li><ul><li>change culture = daxug</li></ul><li>If has Y90 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>Y90:</li><ul><li>change primary culture = daxug</li><li>set ruler culture = daxug</li><li>set heir culture = daxug</li><li>If every owned province has culture is shuvuush:</li><ul><li>change culture = daxug</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has Y92 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>Y92:</li><ul><li>change primary culture = daxug</li><li>set ruler culture = daxug</li><li>set heir culture = daxug</li><li>If every owned province has culture is shuvuush:</li><ul><li>change culture = daxug</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>jaddempire move court minorities from to:</li><ul><li>from = capital_scope</li><li>province id = 4871</li></ul><li>the event [Rebellion And Compromise](../events/rebellion_and_compromise.md) happens</li><li>4871:</li><ul><li>move capital effect = yes</li><li>If does not have culture is shuvuush:</li><ul><li>change culture = daxug</li></ul><li>change province name = "Duzhekho"</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul> | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_daxugo_flag](../flags/formed_daxugo_flag.md)</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is shuvuush</li><li>primary culture  is guwaadun</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is chimbija</li><li>Country is Y96</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="form_baihon_xinh">Reform the Baihon Xinh</a><br />*The Baihon Xihn once defied fate itself, routing Jaher's forces and saving southern Haless from his foriegn empire.

| <a name="form_thangoya">Unite the Townships</a><br />*While all of the Kai are notoriously combative and divisive, none are more so than our own people. Our land has been contested by fiercely independent towns for as long as anyone can remember, only being briefly united to defend from invasion or under the boot of foreign conquerors. For too long have others looked at us as disorderly lords ruling over a wartorn land, we now stand in a position to end this squabbling among the Sikai and forge a new republic capable of standing against our enemies as one people.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>adm tech is at least 7</li><li>owns core province 4777</li><li>owns core province  4788</li><li>owns core province   4778</li><li>owns core province    4789</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>culture is sikai</li></ul> | <li>change tag = Z62</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is part of hre:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>add prestige = 15</li><li>If has government is republic:</li><ul><li>add government reform = kai_republic</li></ul><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>set country flag [formed_thangoya_flag](../flags/formed_thangoya_flag.md)</li><li>If thirabnir area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If phakphon area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ngoen area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If kaiden area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | <li>primary culture is sikai</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Z62</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>ruler culture is sunrise_elf</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_thangoya_flag](../flags/formed_thangoya_flag.md)</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
| <a name="unite_thidinkai">Empire of the Kai</a><br />*Thidinkai has always been known as a land of "savagery" and bloodthirsty warlords, dismissed as a worthless land where one can only find their own death. They do not see the true wealth of these lands, for they are looking in the wrong place. The true wealth of the Thidinkai is in her people, strong and ferocious, diligent and steadfast, honest and courageous. Divided, other peoples knew to fear us.

For centuries we lived forgotten and mistrusted.\n\nNow, as monsters and warlords bring devastation and tribulation to the land, we stand at the head of a vast and mighty domain, rich in culture, arms, and wealth. It is time to proclaim a new empire, built on the principles of Jaerel and his short lived realm. It is time for Haless to be unified not under a conqueror but under a protector. It is time, for a new Sunrise Empire to ascend, and may she never fall.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>owns core province 4871</li><li>capital is at least 4871</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>development is at least 60</li></ul></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 150</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>superregion is yanshen_superregion</li><li>superregion  is south_haless_superregion</li></ul></ul> | <li>change tag = Y00</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is part of hre:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set government rank = 3</li><li>add prestige = 35</li><li>set country flag [formed_sunrise_empire_flag](../flags/formed_sunrise_empire_flag.md)</li><li>If does not have capital is 4871:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Azka Nurdazin"</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>If has capital scope has superregion is yanshen superregion:</li><ul><li>If yanshen superregion does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south haless superregion does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has capital scope has superregion is south haless superregion:</li><ul><li>If yanshen superregion does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south haless superregion does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have government is republic:</li><ul><li>change government = republic</li><li>add government reform = sunrise_court_reform</li></ul><li>Else if has government is republic, and does not have reform is sunrise court reform:</li><ul><li>add government reform = sunrise_court_reform</li></ul> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>ruler culture is sun_elf</li><li>ruler culture  is sunrise_elf</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>superregion is yanshen_superregion</li><li>superregion  is north_haless_superregion</li><li>superregion   is south_haless_superregion</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Y86</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Y00</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>Country is Phoenix Empire</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_sunrise_empire_flag](../flags/formed_sunrise_empire_flag.md)</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li> |
