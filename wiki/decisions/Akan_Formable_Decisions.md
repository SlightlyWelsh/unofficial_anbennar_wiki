| <a name="unite_the_children">Unite the Children of Akan</a><br />*For eons our people have dreamed of an independent Akani realm, free from the clutches of the Kheteratans or the Gnolls. The closest we've come to realizing this came with the Crodamic kingdom, but even then we were forced to serve foreign conquerors. Today, the greatest cities of Akan stand united under our banner, the children of Mother Akan standing together in harmony. Today, we have finally recognized the dream. Today, the kingdom of Akan has been declared, and may it never fall.* | <li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>is not at war</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Akan</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>region is akan_region</li></ul><li>owns core province 382</li><li>owns core province  400</li><li>owns core province   402</li> | <li>set country flag [formed_akan_flag](../flags/formed_akan_flag.md)</li><li>change tag = F58</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If does not have government rank is 2:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 2</li></ul><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>If akan region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT; and does not have area is coastal krahway area; and does not have area is western krahway area; and does not have area is salahad islands area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If oris area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is desha</li><li>primary culture  is far_akani</li><li>primary culture   is khasani</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Akan</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_akan_flag](../flags/formed_akan_flag.md)</li></ul><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
