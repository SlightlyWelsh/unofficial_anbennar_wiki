| <a name="decision_seghdihr_incursions_info">Scouting Reports</a><br />*The goblins pouring out of the Tree of Stone are relentless. They constantly probe our defences and harass our provinces. Fortunately our brave scouts are able to provide us with an estimate of their strength.\n\nThe §YGoblin Incursions§! against us will continue until they are all wiped out. These attacks will be relatively minor, but as they §Ygather strength§! they will be able to expend that §Ygathered strength§! to launch a much more devastating assault. Reclaiming the holds in the §YTree of Stone§! as well as fortifying §YGor Ozumbrog§! will greatly hinder them.* | <li>always</li> | <li>custom tooltip = §Y----------- Incursion Strength -----------§!\n\nTotal Strength:                           §R[Root.incursion_total.GetValue]§!\n\n§Y--------------------------------------------§!\n\nBase:                                         §R1000§!\nGathering Strength:[Root.seghdihr_gathering_status]\nMissions:[Root.seghdihr_mission_status]\n\n§Y--------------------------------------------§!\n\nUncolonized Provinces:                 §R[Root.incursion_empty_provinces.GetValue]§!\nGoblin Provinces:                        §R[Root.incursion_goblin_provinces.GetValue]§!\nGoblin Tribes:                             §R[Root.incursion_goblin_tribes.GetValue]§!\n\n§Y--------------------------------------------§!\n\nGor Ozumbrog fortifications:         §G[Root.incursion_ozumbrog_forts.GetValue]§!\nOvdal Kanzad [Root.seghdihr_kanzad_status]\nGrôzumdihr [Root.seghdihr_grozumdihr_status]\nOvdal-az-Ân [Root.seghdihr_azan_status]\nHul-az-Krakazol [Root.seghdihr_krakazol_status]</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>seghdihr calculate incursion strength = yes</li></ul> | <li>Country is Seghdihr</li><li>has country flag [seghdihr_incursions_scouted](../flags/seghdihr_incursions_scouted.md)</li><li>has country flag  seghdihr_incursions_active</li> |
