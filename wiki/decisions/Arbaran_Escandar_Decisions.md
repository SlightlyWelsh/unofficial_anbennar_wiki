| <a name="reclaim_escandar">Reclaiming Escandar</a><br />*We are the only true heirs of Calasandur, the Great Builder, as such, we must reclaim his greatest works, his castles. The great castle of Escandar is one outside of our direct reach, however. While declaring war is certainly a possible way to reclaim our rightful possessions, a conflict in the Borders would be a logistical nightmare. We may consider negotiating a trade with the castle's current occupants, or we could threaten them into handing it over without a war. If a peaceful resolution fails, war is always an option.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>316:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>truce with is PREV</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>set country flag [escandar_negotiations_started](../flags/escandar_negotiations_started.md)</li><li>the event [Our Approach to Escandar](../events/our_approach_to_escandar.md) happens</li> | <li>Country is Arbaran</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owns 316</li></ul><li>has country flag [reclaim_escandar](../flags/reclaim_escandar.md)</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [escandar_negotiations_started](../flags/escandar_negotiations_started.md)</li></ul> |
