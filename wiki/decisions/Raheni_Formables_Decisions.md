| <a name="form_harimraj">Unite the Harimraj</a><br />*Since the time of Harimar the Great, the Harimraj has been ruled by our people, the harimari. However, this rule has always been tenuous at best, and our weakness was harshly demonstrated to us during the conquest by the Phoenix Empire. Now, however, our nation is finally in a position to truly centralize the Raj and build one single, united state, under the rightful rule of the harimari. No longer is the Raj but a squabbling mess of Prabhia and Senaptia. Now, all shall bow before the Raja of the Harimraj.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is royal_harimari</li><li>has country flag [harimari_in_uppercastes](../flags/harimari_in_uppercastes.md)</li></ul><li>is not at war</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>owns core province 4409</li><li>owns core province  4411</li><li>owns core province   4412</li><li>owns core province    4435</li><li>owns core province     4493</li><li>owns core province      4510</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 100</li><li>superregion is rahen_superregion</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Country is Dhenijanraj</li></ul><li>mission completed is R51_second_final_harimraj</li></ul> | <li>change tag = R70</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is part of hre:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul></ul><li>If has reform is raja reform:</li><ul><li>add government reform = feudalism_reform</li><li>remove country modifier = raj_opened_senapti_ranks</li><li>remove country modifier = raj_closed_senapti_ranks</li></ul><li>set government rank = 3</li><li>add prestige = 50</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>change government to monarchy = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set country flag [formed_harimraj_flag](../flags/formed_harimraj_flag.md)</li><li>If rahen superregion does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>lock racial admin = yes</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is royal_harimari</li><li>has country flag [harimari_in_uppercastes](../flags/harimari_in_uppercastes.md)</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Harimraj</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li> |
| <a name="form_rahenraj">Unite the Rahenraj</a><br />*Since the time of Harimar the “Great”, the Raj of Rahen has been ruled by our conquerors, the tyrant harimari. However, this rule has always been tenuous at best, and their weakness was harshly demonstrated to us during the conquest by the Phoenix Empire. Now, however, our people are finally in a position to rebuild the Raj and build one single, united state, finally under the rightful rule of the Raheni.

| <a name="form_dhugajir">Unite the Elephant-Lords</a><br />*For untold centuries, the lands of Dhugajir have been divided amongst squabbling Elephant-Lords. It was this squabbling that weakened us, and allowed us to be conquered by the Harimari and the Sun Elves. Now, however, that the lands of the Ghavaanaj are united under our rule, we can finally form a unified kingdom of our own.

| <a name="form_nadimraj">Rebuild the Nadimraj</a><br />*Long ago, the Nadimraj was the greatest of all civilisations, a shining beacon of the cultural, economic, and military supremacy of Shamakhad. However today this is a distant memory, buried under the weight of centuries of Harimari domination of our ancestral lands. Now, however, we have reunited our core lands, and the ancient cities of the north stand united once more. The Nadimraj was the greatest of all civilisations, and through our rule, it shall be so again.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>owns core province 4397</li><li>owns core province  4451</li><li>owns core province   4460</li><li>owns core province    4465</li><li>owns core province     4466</li><li>owns core province      4467</li><li>owns core province       4474</li><li>owns core province        4509</li><li>owns core province         4510</li> | <li>change tag = R73</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>4460:</li><ul><li>move capital effect = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is part of hre:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul></ul><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>add prestige = 50</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set country flag [formed_dhugajir_flag](../flags/formed_dhugajir_flag.md)</li><li>If west rajnadhaga area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If khadirnadi area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If east rajnadhaga area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tiltaghar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If middle nadimraj area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If bidhilar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If khadisrapur area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If munlanan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If raghajandi area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If is controlled by the AI, and  has exists is I20:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = I20</li><li>I20:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Tiltaghar</li></ul><li>culture group is upper_raheni</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Nadimraj</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_dhugajir_flag](../flags/formed_dhugajir_flag.md)</li></ul> |
| <a name="form_ghankedhen">Unite the Tribes of Ghankedhen</a><br />*For as long as anyone can remember, the tribes and clans of Ghankedhen have been divided. Our people have always been submissive, whether that be under fellow Raheni, under the Harimari, or even under the Elves. But though conquerors rise and fall, the clans have remained. Though armies come and go, the tribes have survived. Though rulers live and die, the families have endured.\n\nBut now the time has come for us to forge our own destiny. Free of conquerors, free of invaders, for the first time, the Ghankedhen will unite!* | <li>adm tech is at least 8</li><li>is not at war</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 8</li><li>culture is ghankedhen</li></ul> | <li>change tag = R74</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is part of hre:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul></ul><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>add prestige = 50</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set country flag [formed_ghankedhen_flag](../flags/formed_ghankedhen_flag.md)</li> | <li>primary culture is ghankedhen</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Ghankedhen</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_ghankedhen_flag](../flags/formed_ghankedhen_flag.md)</li></ul> |
| <a name="form_dhujat">Reform Dhujat</a><br />*Once, Dhujat was a united force, a great union of cities, that served as a great bulwark of the Raj against the rest of Haless. It was once the richest nation in Rahen, dominating the trade along the great Kharunyana. However, when Jaher and his Phoenix Empire invaded, Dhujati unity was shattered, and has never truly recovered, with its former lands divided between a series of squabbling city-states, all claiming to be the rightful heirs to the Dhujati legacy.\n\nWe, however, have come out on top, and united the lands of Dhujat under our rule. Now, although not all of the states are under our control, we have united the lands west of the Kharunyana, and can now declare ourselves Dhujat reborn, in order to truly begin the process of reuniting our great nation.* | <li>adm tech is at least 10</li><li>is not at war</li><li>owns core province 4409</li><li>owns core province  4492</li><li>owns core province   4493</li><li>owns core province    4497</li><li>owns core province     4499</li><li>owns core province      4501</li><li>owns core province       4504</li> | <li>change tag = R75</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is part of hre:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul></ul><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>add prestige = 50</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set country flag [formed_dhujat_flag](../flags/formed_dhujat_flag.md)</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is muthadhaya</li><li>primary culture  is rasarhid</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is royal_harimari</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>region is dhujat_region</li></ul></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Dhujat</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_dhujat_flag](../flags/formed_dhujat_flag.md)</li></ul> |
| <a name="form_sardhasi">Unite the Southern Cities</a><br />*Across southern Rahen, great cities rise. Whether the peoples of those cities be Raheni or Harimari matters not, for they live in relative harmony. With the caste system ensuring stability, the lands of the south have prospered. Now, however, for the first time in living memory, they have been united under our rule. By proclaiming a new nation, we shall unite all peoples of Southern Rahen, whether they be Harimari or Raheni, into one great union of cities, one great kingdom of kingdoms, one true people of peoples; Sardhasi.* | <li>adm tech is at least 10</li><li>is not at war</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 9</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 4435</li><li>province id  is at least 4427</li><li>province id   is at least 4426</li><li>province id    is at least 4412</li><li>province id     is at least 4411</li><li>province id      is at least 4410</li><li>province id       is at least 4391</li><li>province id        is at least 4392</li><li>province id         is at least 4418</li><li>province id          is at least 4419</li><li>province id           is at least 4417</li><li>province id            is at least 4423</li><li>province id             is at least 4405</li><li>province id              is at least 4368</li></ul></ul> | <li>change tag = R76</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is part of hre:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul></ul><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>add prestige = 50</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set country flag [formed_sardhasi_flag](../flags/formed_sardhasi_flag.md)</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is south_raheni</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is royal_harimari</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is rahen_coast_region</li><li>area is south_marutha_area</li><li>area  is south_ghankedhen_area</li><li>area   is north_ghankedhen_area</li><li>area    is kramitra_area</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Dhenijanraj</li><li>tag  is Vanrahar</li><li>tag   is Bhuvauri</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Sardhasi</li></ul><li>is using normal or historical nations</li><li>was never end game tag trigger is yes</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_sardhasi_flag](../flags/formed_sardhasi_flag.md)</li></ul> |
| <a name="form_vanrahar">Form Vanrahar</a><br />*For more than a millennia the Harimari have dominated Haless. Our homeland, however, the jungles of the Ascension Peninsula, where our people first arose, has for centuries been divided amongst various squabbling states. Now, however, it is united once more, as it has not been since the days of Harimar the Great of legend. Now, with our people truly united, we can build a modern Harimari state.
