| <a name="ghavaanaj_palace_build_the_grand_granaries">Build the Grand Granaries</a><br />*With the initial construction of The Ivory Palace, we have created facilities where we can share space with our pachyderm comrades, and meet with foreign dignitaries with them. With the number of elephants present in the palace, it is a fairly large burden to haul in enough food. Plans were drafted to establish the largest system of granaries in Rahen to handle it; we need only provide the funds.* | <li>4485:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_palace_construction</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>4485:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_palace_construction</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_the_grand_granaries</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | <li>4485:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_the_ivory_palace</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_the_grand_granaries</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_palace_build_the_painted_court">Build the Painted Court</a><br />*In the early plans for The Ivory Palace, we had a grand hall included, that we might host subjects and dignitaries while flaunting our wealth. With construction done on the actual hall, the time has come to bring in the artists and craftsmen to showcase the vibrant colours that our court life will reflect.* | <li>4485:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_palace_construction</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>4485:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_palace_construction</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_the_painted_court</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | <li>4485:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_the_ivory_palace</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_the_painted_court</li></ul></ul> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_palace_build_the_royal_menagerie">Build the Royal Menagerie</a><br />*The wide halls and lofty ceilings of The Ivory Palace were designed with the proportions of our elephantine family members in mind, but plans were also drafted for a grand menagerie to be added on, complete with avian gardens, exotic animal displays, and of course housing for the best of the royal herd. The time has come for us to build it so that we can easily sway our future leaders into service by awing them with the facilities and creatures.* | <li>4485:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_palace_construction</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>4485:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_palace_construction</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_the_royal_menagerie</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | <li>4485:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_the_ivory_palace</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_the_royal_menagerie</li></ul></ul> |
