| <a name="G52_adopt_taychendi">Adopt the Taychendi</a><br />*The peoples of Taychend are vast and plentiful, if properly organized they could forge a nation in any shape they chose. Fortunately for us, they have yet to be organized, so we shall adopt them into our organizations, so that the nation forged within these lands is one that follows the principles of Kheionism.* | <li>mission completed is G52_against_warlords</li><li>has institution renaissance</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>region is taychend_region</li><li>religion is kheionism</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is an island</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul><li>2520:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>religion is kheionism</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [ameion_adopt](../flags/ameion_adopt.md)</li><li>2520:</li><ul><li>change culture = klereyen</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier G52_straw_brick for 25 years</li> | <li>mission completed is G52_against_warlords</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [ameion_adopt](../flags/ameion_adopt.md)</li></ul> |
| <a name="G52_precursor_excavation">Precursor Site Excavation</a><br />*When the Ashen skies darkened the Kheions, they too cast into darkness our ancestors' knowledge of what came before them. But in these kheions the light of civilization endured, and with our arrival in Taychend it has fallen to us to reclaim the birthright of our peoples. But first, it must be rediscovered…* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Country is G00</li></ul><li>Country is G00</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Country is Ameion</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is ameion_no_excavation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>kheionai superregion:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavation</li></ul></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>greater taychend superregion:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 30</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has country flag [ameion_search_possible](../flags/ameion_search_possible.md)</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>province group is excavation_sites</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavation</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavated</li></ul></ul><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>province group is excavation_sites</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavation</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavated</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is ameion_tacenie</li><li>has country flag [ameion_search_possible](../flags/ameion_search_possible.md)</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>province group is excavation_sites</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavation</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavated</li></ul></ul><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>province group is excavation_sites</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavation</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier G52_excavated</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Choosing Excavation Site](../events/choosing_excavation_site.md) happens</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Ameion</li><li>tag  is G00</li></ul><li>religion is kheionism</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier G52_mage_8</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country modifier G52_ai_dig</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country modifier G52_search_tacenie</li></ul> |
| <a name="G52_larankar_treaty">Treaty of Masialendi</a><br />*Taychend has become increasingly consolidated by ourselves and the Amarayam of Larankar. While some may argue they have the strength to drive us from the continent, it is obvious they struggle to maintain their grasp on the Kalavendhi.\nAs we focus our efforts in the south, we may find room to negotiate with the Larankarha to stick to agreed spheres of influence, so that we can each consolidate our holdings.* | <li>Country is Ameion</li><li>mission completed is G52_prepare_push</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>mission completed is G52_civilization_taychend</li></ul><li>taychend region:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Larankar</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Larankar</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>area is marhed_varanya_area</li><li>area  is bettagophira_area</li><li>culture is kalavendhi</li></ul></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>is at war</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 200</li> | <li>set country flag [ameion_treaty](../flags/ameion_treaty.md)</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>G64:</li><ul><li>the event [Ameion Offers Treaty](../events/ameion_offers_treaty.md) happens</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = If Larankar accepts our offer: §YLarankarha§! or §YKalavendhi§! provinces, and §YMarhed Varanya§! & §YBettagophira§! areas controlled by us and our subjects shall be ceded to them, but other Taychendi lands controlled by Larankar and their subjects shall be ceded to us.\nThey shall also abandon any allies or subjects outside these areas, but vassalize any ally within said areas.</li> | <li>Country is Ameion</li><li>mission completed is G52_prepare_push</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>mission completed is G52_civilization_taychend</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [ameion_treaty](../flags/ameion_treaty.md)</li></ul><li>exists is Larankar</li> |
