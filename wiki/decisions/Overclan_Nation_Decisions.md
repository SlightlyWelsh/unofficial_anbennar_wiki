| <a name="overclan_nation">Form the Overclan</a><br />*The lands of Bahar have suffered greatly from their own internal peril and from the goblin exodus into them. But now our clan has defeated all other clans and established a firm dominance over most of Bahar. We are now in the position to fully unify this region under a single clan!\n\nHowever, this new nation will not be a mere country of goblins, no. Bahar is a place of many races, some of which have already learnt how to work with us and accept our rule, and others will surely follow soon. We shall be known as the Overclan - a union of all of Bahar and her many divided people under the wise, strong and prosperous rule of goblins!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is semi_or_non_monstrous_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [semi_monstrous](../flags/semi_monstrous.md)</li><li>has country flag  no_longer_monstrous</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier monstrous_nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>is free or tributary trigger is yes</li><li>is not at war</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 25</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is ourdia_region</li><li>region  is bahar_region</li><li>region   is harpy_hills_region</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>medium tolerance human race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance human race trigger is yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>medium tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>medium tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>medium tolerance harpy race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance harpy race trigger is yes</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>owns core province 536</li><li>owns core province  516</li><li>owns core province   521</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>owns core province 538</li><li>owns core province  522</li><li>owns core province   510</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>government is tribal</li></ul> | <li>change tag = F78</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>remove non electors emperors from empire effect = yes</li><li>If has government rank is 1:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 2</li></ul><li>If bahar region does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F78</li></ul><li>If ourdia region does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F78</li></ul><li>If ur monkande area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F78</li></ul><li>If kuzak area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F78</li></ul><li>If kuz mountains area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F78</li></ul><li>If imuluses area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F78</li></ul><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>If does not have custom ideas:</li><ul><li>the event [New Traditions & Ambitions](../events/new_traditions_ambitions.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "centralization_modifier" for 20 years</li><li>set country flag [formed_overclan_flag](../flags/formed_overclan_flag.md)</li><li>the event [Naming Our State](../events/naming_our_state.md) happens</li> | <li>primary culture is exodus_goblin</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [formed_overclan_flag](../flags/formed_overclan_flag.md)</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Aqatbar Overclan</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is not former colonial nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is former colonial nation</li><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul></ul><li>is not colonial nation</li><li>is using normal or historical nations</li> |
