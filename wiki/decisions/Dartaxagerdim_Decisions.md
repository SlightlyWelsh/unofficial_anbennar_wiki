| <a name="F22_expand_college">Expand the Garlas-Kel College</a><br />*Hedge wizards, forest witches, and untrained novices have flocked to the magical haven of Garlas-Kel since its establishment by our Masnsih allies. Their initiative in preserving the Bulwari magical tradition has been so successful, however, that the szal-Fazil have encountered an unexpected problem: the current facilities are insufficient to handle the ever-increasing influx of students. The current headmaster of the college has come to request a royal edict to expand the college's grounds and continue the exploration of the genie palace beneath the school's foundation.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>has estate privilege estate_mages_battlemage_academies</li> | <li>country gets the modifier dartaxagerdim_ideas for 50 years</li><li>658:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change culture = masnsih</li></ul><li>add accepted culture = masnsih</li><li>set country flag [garlas_college](../flags/garlas_college.md)</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Dartaxagerdim</li><li>Country was Dartaxagerdim</li></ul><li>has country flag [ulmis_idiqlat_pillaged](../flags/ulmis_idiqlat_pillaged.md)</li><li>658:</li><ul><li>has province modifier dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [garlas_college](../flags/garlas_college.md)</li></ul> |
| <a name="F22_reform_legions">Establish the Dartaxian Legions</a><br />*Our rule extends from Gem Isle to the plains of the Suran. Our once-fledgling movement bloomed into a kingdom and now stands as a proud empire, the first seen in Bulwar since the days of Jaher. No matter our reservations, we will take lessons from his success and form our own armies, whose ability and power will overshadow even the infamous Phoenix Legions.* | <li>owns core province 625</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Sareyand</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 400</li><li>treasury is at least 10000</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>num of rebel armies is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>the event [Formation of the Dartaxian Legions](../events/formation_of_the_dartaxian_legions.md) happens</li><li>add mil power = -400</li><li>add treasury = -10000</li><li>set country flag [dartaxian_legions](../flags/dartaxian_legions.md)</li><li>remove country modifier = dartaxagerdim_sebhuliam_revolt</li><li>clr country flag [dartax_mage_sebhuliam](../flags/dartax_mage_sebhuliam.md)</li> | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Dartaxagerdim</li><li>Country was Dartaxagerdim</li></ul><li>has country flag [ash_legion_lessons](../flags/ash_legion_lessons.md)</li><li>has country flag  curbed_sebhuliam</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [dartaxian_legions](../flags/dartaxian_legions.md)</li></ul> |
| <a name="build_the_ziggurat_of_surakel">Build the Ziggurat of Surakel</a><br />*Surakel is praised in many temples throughout Bulwar, but none are worthy of his glory. It is time we amended that. Let us build the greatest temple for our radiant god. It will be a big investment, but it will be worth it.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction building</li></ul><li>religion is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = ziggurat_of_surakel</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>has country flag [dartaxagerdim_ziggurat_of_surakel_flag](../flags/dartaxagerdim_ziggurat_of_surakel_flag.md)</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [ziggurat_of_surakel_built](../flags/ziggurat_of_surakel_built.md)</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has building ziggurat_of_surakel</li></ul></ul> |
