| <a name="B50_our_fellow_small_fellows">Our Fellow Small Fellows</a><br />*This new home of ours may be enticing, but we shouldn't forget the places we came from. Indeed, we would do well to establish ties with some of our fellow halfling nations, that we might weather our troubles together. Let us set up safe routes of travel for our diplomats back to the western side of the Dameshead, to make these ties a bit easier to bind.* | <li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is halfling</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier newshire_envoy_speed for 25 years</li> | [Out Of The Frying Pan](#B50_out_of_the_frying_pan)<br /> |
| <a name="B50_riddles_in_the_dark">Riddles In The Dark</a><br />*They're definitely not halflings, but our people and the dwarves of Halann ought to stick together. We might be small, but by combining our attitudes with their artificery, we can become greater than the sum of our parts. By inviting a few to settle in our capital, we can begin that process sooner rather than later.* | <li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul> | <li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Our Fellow Small Fellows](#B50_our_fellow_small_fellows)<br /> |
| <a name="B50_buzzing_sounds">Buzzing Sounds</a><br />*Though the bees of Escann are capable of doing their jobs, they simply don't compare with our old, carefully-bred bees from our origins. Successfully acclimatising some of them to these lands would be a very worthwhile investment. If we're friendly enough with the owners of The Largest Small City, we should be able to arrange for an introduction. If not... well, halflings are known for being sneaky, if nothing else.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>owns 151</li></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>owns 151</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>151:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier newshire_unfriendly_deliveries for 10 years</li> | [Our Eyes Are Yet To Open](#B50_our_eyes_are_yet_to_open)<br /> |
| <a name="B50_blessed_be_our_bees">Blessed Be Our Bees</a><br />*Our new bees have finally settled down, and we've already begun to see results. However, many of our farmers, having never even seen the Small Country, lack the knowledge to properly care for them. If we were to distribute some apiaries to the most learned members of our clergy, we could finally utilise the insects on a nationwide scale.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier newshire_unfriendly_deliveries</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>has terrain farmlands</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building temple</li><li>has building  cathedral</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>country gets the modifier newshire_buzzing_farmhands until otherwise removed</li> | [Buzzing Sounds](#B50_buzzing_sounds)<br /> |

She has no need for Knight or King.\nBut hold no fear within your halfling heart,\nShe has no wish to pierce you with her dart.\nShe simply wants the plants, with no delay,\nTo grow up strong and seize the Newshire day!'\n\nExcerpt from 'The Honey And The Hives', a children's book by Conrad Kettlebrook.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is transmutation_2_tooltip</li><li>has ruler flag [transmutation_2](../flags/transmutation_2.md)</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier newshire_bee_knights until otherwise removed</li> | [Blessed Be Our Bees](#B50_blessed_be_our_bees)<br />[Burst Into Bloom](#B50_burst_into_bloom)<br /> |

| <a name="B50_out_of_the_frying_pan">Out Of The Frying Pan</a><br />*We have done our part to repel the Greentide, but we did not do it alone. Dotted across Escann, between orcs, goblins, and rivals alike, are potential allies waiting to be brought to our tables. Let us reach out to them once more, to secure our place in these lands; only then can we ensure that they prosper.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>desc is newshire_frying_pan_tooltip</li><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is escann_superregion</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = statesman</li><li>name = "Austin Kettlebrook"</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = redfoot_halfling</li><li>religion = regent_court</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier newshire_frying_pan for 25 years</li> | [A Seed, Sown](#B50_a_seed_sown)<br /> |
| <a name="B50_a_gentlefolk">A Gentlefolk</a><br />*Despite the trials and tribulations our people have faced as we settled in Escann, many have refused to give up their peaceful, cheerful ways. Newshiremen appear broadly content with their lot in life; happy, so long as they have land to farm and food in their bellies. Even the ex-adventurers of the Small Fellows have begun settling down, taking much more mundane and relaxing requests in place of the death-defying feats of glory they used to prefer.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier newshire_simple_lives until otherwise removed</li> | [Out Of The Frying Pan](#B50_out_of_the_frying_pan)<br /> |
| <a name="B50_setting_ourselves_apart">Setting Ourselves Apart</a><br />*The longer we spend away from the Small Country, the more different our culture becomes. In recent times, we have even begun to refer to ourselves entirely separately to our old halfling loyalties. No longer are we Redfoot, Bluefoot, Visfoot, or Imperial - we are the Newfoot of Newshire! Now, let's see about a nice cup of tea...* | <li>culture is newfoot_halfling</li><li>owns core province 766</li><li>766:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>trade goods is gold</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [An Unexpected Party](../events/an_unexpected_party.md) happens</li> | [A Gentlefolk](#B50_a_gentlefolk)<br /> |

And yet, we have fought for our place here. We have started to tame the forests and fields, setting down roots with which to establish ourselves. Now, we proclaim a new banner; one of a new halfling nation, where we may finally throw off the yoke of our taller oppressors. No longer are we strangers here!

| <a name="B50_loamy_soil">Loamy Soil</a><br />*It's easy to get caught up on the negatives of these lands, but we halflings are rather used to looking towards the future. Instead of lamenting the harsh wilds, let us ruminate on the fresh, arable soil we now live on.

| <a name="B50_queer_lodgings">Queer Lodgings</a><br />*Across Newshire, halflings have taken to building their homes into the rolling hills and dales that make up much of the local terrain. Many of these halfling holes are surrounded by beautiful gardens and expansive farms, and since our home is more a collection of countless villages rather than large cities, there's more than enough room to go around.
