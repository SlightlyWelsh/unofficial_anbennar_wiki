| <a name="lodhum_secure_borders">Secure our Borders</a><br />*As we reach out into the world around us once more, the world may well reach back. As our first priority, it would be wise to establish a perimeter in every direction, to ensure that our hold cannot be approached unseen while it is still so vulnerable.* | <li>2968:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>2976:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>2974:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier lodhum_settler_bonus for 40 years</li> |  |
| <a name="lodhum_down_railway">Down the Railway</a><br />*The majority of the other holds of the Serpentreach can be reached by following the old ruined tracks of the Argrod westward. Verkal Skomdihr, the shield against the Deepwood. Arg-Ôrdstun, ever fiercely defiant. Shazstundihr, the Marble Gate. Orlghelovar, home of the Glasslords.\n\nHave they survived, like us? Or have they fallen long ago? Let us carve our way towards them, no matter what goblin or orc stands in our way. We may yet unite with our lost kin, or barring that, avenge them.* | <li>2969:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>owned by  is Thieving Arrow</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul><li>4240:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>owned by  is Thieving Arrow</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>H87:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul><li>4100:</li><ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure our Borders](#lodhum_secure_borders)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_wooden_door">The Wooden Door</a><br />*Though we had not laid eyes on it for many centuries, stories about the Deepwood remained popular among our people. It has a very romantic quality about itself: dangerous but beautiful, magical but treacherous.\n\nDuring the time of Aul-Dwarov, Verkal Skomdihr stood as the bulwark against it and the gateway to it. In spite of its labyrinthine entranceways and warding magic, however, it fell long ago, with orcs defiling its ruined halls.\n\nLet us reclaim and rebuild the wood-ward hold, and let it fulfill its old purpose.* | <li>4100:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul> | <li>4100:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = lodhum_skomdihr_wooden_door_modifier</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Wounded Elf](../events/the_wounded_elf.md) happens</li></ul> | [Down the Railway](#lodhum_down_railway)<br /> |

| <a name="lodhum_foul_rats">Foul Rats</a><br />*Although you can't walk ten paces beyond our borders without running into goblins, most are unorganized and pose relatively little threat. There appears to be one tribe, however, that could pose a serious threat to us. We must eliminate this Thieving Arrow tribe, sooner rather than later.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Thieving Arrow</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>add mil power = 75</li> | [Down the Railway](#lodhum_down_railway)<br /> |

We ought to find the best metal veins in the area, and set up mining operations there.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>trade goods  is copper</li><li>trade goods   is mithril</li></ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier lodhum_safe_mine_modifier for 20 years</li> | [Foul Rats](#lodhum_foul_rats)<br /> |

| <a name="lodhum_monument_glory">A Monument to His Glory</a><br />*Gerin's legacy is in every new tunnel dug, every road cleared of vermin, every step taken by every dwarf outside of Ovdal Lodhum's walls. But even fulfilling the tasks he inspired us to, a quest we have just begun, will not be sufficient to honour this man. This legend, and all his glory.\n\nWe shall begin work on another form of tribute. It too shall be insufficient, but we must try nonetheless.* | <li>4098:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 6</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>the event [A Monument to a Man, and More](../events/a_monument_to_a_man_and_more.md) happens</li> | [Legacy of Gerin Orcrend](#lodhum_legacy)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_death_to_orcs">Death to the Orcs</a><br />*War. War never changes.\n\nBut we have. We've opened up long-slumbering gates, we've sharpened rusty blades, we've dug up old maps and sketched out new ones.\n\nAnd we've learned, again, the terror of an orc charging at you, the thrill of being seized by blood-lust, and the emptiness when that fades. We've learned the feel as a sword cuts through flesh, the judder when it stops at bone. We've learned what it is to watch a friend die mere meters away, to leave their corpse behind in retreat.\n\nWe forgot these things. Orcrend did not. And now, from beyond, he has taught us one last time.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is lodhum_death_to_orcs_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is orcrend_natives_counter</li><li>value is at least 5</li></ul></ul><li>is year is at least 1510</li></ul> | <li>the event [Onwards with Orcrend](../events/onwards_with_orcrend.md) happens</li> | [A Monument to His Glory](#lodhum_monument_glory)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_in_memory">In his Memory</a><br />*On a winter day, roughly a century ago, Gerin Orcrend stepped foot into the Serpentspine Mountains. He never saw the sun again, never saw another human.\n\nOn another day, a few decades ago, a human entered Ovdal Lodhum's gates. The first, and only, human most of us have ever seen. One human, who awakened us, reforged us, set us toward a new destiny that we have only begun to realize. He was the first human in Ovdal Lodhum, but even if the rest are one-tenth the man he was, they'd be an asset to our Hold. Let us step into the light and invite them here!* | <li>thievesbane area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>2966:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>2966:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = infantry</li><li>amount = 2</li></ul></ul><li>the event [A Land in Turmoil](../events/a_land_in_turmoil.md) happens</li> | [Death to the Orcs](#lodhum_death_to_orcs)<br /> |

| <a name="lodhum_warm_embrace">A Warm Embrace</a><br />*It has been a long journey to reach where we are now, with allies and friends in both Bulwar and the Deepwoods. In this, we can see the beginnings of a way forward into the future.\n\nThe surface world is a hostile, foreign place and we have no desire to lord over it. Therefore, it is best we maintain our relations with our friends and allies, alongside working to make new ones when needed. This way, we can secure the bounty of the world above without any of the hassles of governance or the horrors of conquest.* | <li>2973:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>stability is at least 2</li></ul></ul></ul><li>4100:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li></ul></ul></ul><li>2966:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1000</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier lodhum_warm_embrace_modifier until otherwise removed</li><li>set country flag [lodhum_part2_start](../flags/lodhum_part2_start.md)</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li> | [Sheathed at Last](#lodhum_sheathed)<br />[Free the Oppressed](#lodhum_free_oppressed)<br /> |

| <a name="lodhum_other_hold">The Other Hold</a><br />*We have at long last discovered another hold in the Serpentreach! Arg-Ôrdstun, like us, have managed to weather the ages. It is important that we as dwarves, regardless of hearth and hold, come together as one people to reclaim our home.\n\nLet us send a delegation to inspire them to join us and unite as one people in the face of the greatest challenge of our age, reclaiming the Dwarovar. * | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>knows country is Arg-Ordstun</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Arg-Ordstun</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is H76:</li><ul><li>the event [Another Grudge](../events/another_grudge.md) happens</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4093:</li><ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>set country flag [lodhum_ordstun_start](../flags/lodhum_ordstun_start.md)</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li></ul> | [A Pure Heart](#lodhum_pure_heart)<br /> |

| <a name="lodhum_love_not_weak">Love Is Not Weak</a><br />*Arg-Ôrdstun's insults still ring in our ears. They called us weak because we cling to love, despite the fact that it was love that kept our hold strong throughout the ages. It was love that kept Gerin with us, and it was love that finally began to let us claim the Dwarovar.\n\nThe Diamond Dwarves are misguided, but we can teach them. Love is more than just being strong for one another, it is also about allowing ourselves to be weak for one another. The Diamond Dwarves have the first part, we will have to show them how to be the second.* | <li>4093:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Arg-Ordstun</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add legitimacy = 25</li><li>If does not have serpentreach region has culture is diamond dwarf:</li><ul><li>add dip power = 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add accepted culture = diamond_dwarf</li></ul> | [The Other Hold](#lodhum_other_hold)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_what_connects">But Is What Connects Us</a><br />*Arg-Ôrdstun is restored, the hold a glittering beacon in the darkness of the Dwarovar once again. It was only the labour of both of us and the bonds of love that were created from it that allowed this.\n\nWe have established a place where lovers, both Diamond and Garnet Dwarves, can be together. Though it took much time and effort, they now understand that alone, we are weak. But together we are stronger than even the hardest of diamonds.* | <li>4093:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If does not have serpentreach region has culture is diamond dwarf:</li><ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>4093:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = lodhum_what_connects_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is diamond dwarf:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = lodhum_arg_love</li><li>duration = 10950</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Love Is Not Weak](#lodhum_love_not_weak)<br /> |

| <a name="lodhum_restore_hold">Restore our Hold</a><br />*Ovdal Lodhum has been isolated for centuries, and unfortunately in those centuries, our home has stagnated and decayed. Gone are the days when lovers from across the Dwarovar wandered the beautifully carved halls of our home in love with both each other and their surroundings.\n\nWe must prepare for the day when that will once again come to pass. Dust the halls! Clean the bedding! Ovdal Lodhum will be a place truly worthy of the name!* | <li>2973:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>2973:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = lodhum_restore_hold_modifier</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="lodhum_pure_heart">A Pure Heart</a><br />*The Dwarovar has become a frightening place. Orcs, goblins, and other nasty creatures of the deeps have wormed their way into our ancient home. Only a hold of pure heart and united courage could ever hope to reclaim it.\n\nThankfully, we have both the love in our hearts and the unity of purpose that it brings. The various groups and cliques in our hold have given their assurances that we will have their utmost support in the reclamation of the Dwarovar.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 30</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has estate estate_nobles</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 30</li></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 30</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 30</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier lodhum_pure_heart_modifier for 20 years</li> | [Restore our Hold](#lodhum_restore_hold)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_up_railway">Up the Railway</a><br />*We have begun to explore eastwards, towards the old rails that lead to Gor Bûrad. Once a centre of industrial might, between there and here is also the main - and to our knowledge, only - entryway into the Serpentreach, that being the Gorrod.\n\nIf we can capture the entryway into the Serpentreach, it will ensure that no more goblins or orcs could make their way into our home. * | <li>2970:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>owned by  is Blackbeard Cartel</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul><li>2979:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>owned by  is Blackbeard Cartel</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul><li>2980:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>owned by  is Blackbeard Cartel</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>2981:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>argrod 14 16 area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>gor burad area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>4039:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Pure Heart](#lodhum_pure_heart)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_surface_dwarves">The Surface Dwarves</a><br />*These dwarves are not like us. They do not come from some hold in the mountains that has held out against the orcs, but instead are descended from kindred who fled to the surface in ages past.\n\nThey call themselves Silver Dwarves, after the hall from which they hail. But after the event which emptied the Dwarovar of hundreds of thousands of orcs they, like many others it seems, have come to reclaim their ancestral homeland.\n\nLet us then prove that there is a home for them to return to, one with open loving arms, and make use of their new ideas and ways of thinking. * | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Blackbeard Cartel</li></ul><li>H71:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier lodhum_surface_dwarves_modifier for 20 years</li> | [Up the Railway](#lodhum_up_railway)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_their_tomb">This Shall Be Their Tomb</a><br />*The entrance to the rest of the Dwarovar is secured. It must be fortified and patrolled at all times to ensure that no orc or goblin can infiltrate its way behind our borders and cause the same degree of chaos which led to our peoples' decline.\n\nWith the mountains sealed off, we can finally focus on purging the remaining orcs and goblins in the Serpentreach, now that they have no hope for any reinforcement or help. We shall ensure their caverns become their tombs.* | <li>2981:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2981:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>If has dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>add splendor = 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add army tradition = 10</li></ul><li>If every country has culture is orcish is yes, and  has any owned province has continent is serpentspine:</li><ul><li>add historical rival = ROOT</li></ul> | [Death to the Orcs](#lodhum_death_to_orcs)<br />[The Surface Dwarves](#lodhum_surface_dwarves)<br /> |
| <a name="lodhum_no_orc_mountain">No Orc Under the Mountain</a><br />*Every orc male, female, and even their runts lay dead. The Serpentreach is clear.\n\nWhile some goblin band here or there may remain in a hidden or collapsed section of tunnel or cavern, the major threat, that being of the orcs, is no more. The Serpentreach is now clean and we have done such a job it would make even Gerin proud. Let us bask in the afterglow of such a job well done, and enjoy the hard earned fruits of our labour of love.* | <li>serpentreach region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is lodhum_no_orc_mountain_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has orcish majority trigger yes</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has orcish minority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 10</li></ul><li>lodhum upgrade gerin modifier = yes</li> | [This Shall Be Their Tomb](#lodhum_their_tomb)<br /> |
