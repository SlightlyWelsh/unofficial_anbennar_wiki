| <a name="goblin_borrowed_learning">Borrowed" Knowledge</a><br />*We must scavenge for what we can in the ruins of this world we now find ourselves in. Every little scrap. Perhaps then we can find something worthwhile.\n\nOur neighbors near us also squat on the ruins of what once was. We're started to run out of ruins of our own to root through. Perhaps they could have something worthwhile?* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>num of times used pillage capital is at least 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>is looted</li><li>devastation is at least 10</li><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add next institution embracement = 15</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_learning_from_new_neighbors" for 15 years</li> | [A Meat Wall](#goblin_meat_wall)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_ingenuity">Goblin Ingenuity</a><br />*Escann has a lot of new sights and people. Many of these people are tall, and get very very angry when you get near. But despite this they seem to have a lot of interesting tools and ideas! Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from these tall folk?* | <li>has institution feudalism</li> | <li>change innovativeness = 2</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_escann_ingenuity" for 10 years</li> | [Borrowed" Knowledge](#goblin_borrowed_learning)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_superiority">Goblin Superiority</a><br />*We have taken the Cannorians' ideas and ran with it. Sure, they might still consider us backwards, monstrous, worthless creatures. But a goblin's mind is QUICK, and they underestimate us! We shall show our superiority yet.* | <li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>tech difference is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>change innovativeness = 5</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_keeping_up" for 15 years</li> | [Goblin Ingenuity](#goblin_ingenuity)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_warmachine">The Goblin Warmachine</a><br />*For the entire history of our society, our military has been little more than clansmen scrambling with sticks and rocks. Now our sticks and rocks explode.\n\nWe must form a true army, something to both protect us, and show off our superiority! And nothing says superiority more than MORE explosions! We shall become a force to be reckoned with, yet!* | <li>army size is at least 15</li><li>num of artillery is at least 5</li><li>innovativeness is at least 10</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "goblin_tools_for_the_army" for 25 years</li> | [A New Nation](#goblin_new_nation)<br /> |

| <a name="goblin_rest_of_us">The Rest Of Us</a><br />*We are not the only clan to escape the caves. Countless of our brothers were dragged here as well, and there are still many orcish clans nearby as well.\n\nWe all have some kind of connection, no matter how small. Perhaps they could be of some use to us? One way or another...* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>has country modifier monstrous_nation</li></ul><li>any rival country:</li><ul><li>has country modifier monstrous_nation</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "goblin_sharing_supplies" for 10 years</li> | [A Meat Wall](#goblin_meat_wall)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_faith_means">What Faith Means To Us</a><br />*As we try to find our place in this world, many of us will turn to faith. Goblins, in general, are rather pragmatic when it comes to our faith. We've taken care of ourselves on our own this entire time, why would we need gods to help us?\n\nBut in these troubling times, the offer of some kind of support is comforting. And the Cannorian pantheon has so many interesting ideas! Perhaps we could learn from them?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has adopted cult cannorian_cult</li><li>religion group is cannorian</li><li>religion group  is kheteratan</li></ul> | <li>change government reform progress = 20</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_reaching_out" for 20 years</li> | [Borrowed" Knowledge](#goblin_borrowed_learning)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_learning_common">Learning Common</a><br />*A raiding party brought us some kind of leather package they had found during one of their scavenges through the old cities. It tasted quite bad, and had a lot of weird scribbles in it. Our wisemen suggest that it is a form of writing that the Cannorians call "Common".\n\nThis could prove quite useful to us. If our leadership tried to learn this foreign way of speaking, they could more easily communicate and learn more from them. And, in turn, could more easily take advantage of situations with the Cannorians...* | <li>any known country:</li><ul><li>technology group is tech_cannorian</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 0</li></ul></ul> | <li>change government reform progress = 20</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_learning_common" for 25 years</li> | [What Faith Means To Us](#goblin_faith_means)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_wild_orcs">'Convincing' the Wild Orcs</a><br />*The regions surrounding our settlements contain many orcish hordes, disorganized and lost after the fall of the Dookanson. We've decided what to do with the orcs within our borders, but perhaps the ones just outside could be just as useful to us?\n\nIt can be surprisingly easy to convince an orc to do what you want them to do. It takes a small show of strength, a little cleverness, and a bit of luck, to convince them that it was THEIR idea to help us farm, all along!* | <li>prestige is at least 40</li><li>innovativeness is at least 5</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "goblin_orcish_influx" for 10 years</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Our Old Masters](#goblin_old_masters)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_old_cities">The Old Cities</a><br />*Ruins of old settlements litter Escann, a sign of the damage we, and the orcs, did when we first entered this land. As we repopulate the area, we must come to a conclusion of what it is we plan to do with this new nation we made\n\nWhy is it that we expand ever further? Is it to protect ourselves? Or perhaps to rebuild from the damage we caused? Whatever the answer, it is something we must come to realize for ourselves.* | <li>num of cities is at least 15</li><li>grown by development is at least 75</li> | <li>add mil power = 100</li><li>the event [Why We Expand](../events/why_we_expand.md) happens</li> | [A New Nation](#goblin_new_nation)<br /> |

| <a name="goblin_meat_wall">A Meat Wall</a><br />*The Dookanson has fallen, and we are alone.\n\nThe orcs have abandoned us to our fate, and in some cases struck back at us, either for some untold grudge, or so that they may scrounge their way up from the bottom with us. The masses are in disarray, terrified of what will come next.\n\nWhat must come next, is a force to defend us. If we're going to survive here, we're going to need a lot of forces. Thankfully, we can supply them.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.50</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "goblin_force_to_defend" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="goblin_new_home">Our New Home</a><br />*Now that we have a force to defend us as long as we're here, we need to step back and see what "here" really is. There is much empty land around us for the taking, kept only by disorganized orcish hordes. Perhaps, if we're lucky, we can take some of that land for ourselves.* | <li>num of cities is at least 5</li> | <li>add adm power = 50</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_room_to_grow" for 10 years</li> | [The Rest Of Us](#goblin_rest_of_us)<br />[A Meat Wall](#goblin_meat_wall)<br />[Remove the Ambitious](#goblin_remove_ambitious)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_old_masters">Our Old Masters</a><br />*For centuries we were little more than fodder to be killed by the dDwarves, or in some cases, enslaved. Then the orcs came, and we were little more than fodder to be enslaved, or in some cases, killed.\n\nWe have been stepped on for most of our history. That's how we came to be here, fodder for the Dookansons's armies. But we're in charge here, and there are some orcs in our midst, now living among us. What should we do about this?\n\nSome of our elders wish for a debt to be paid, for all that they've suffered. Many younger progressive minds, however, believe that we should let bygones be bygones, and together the orcs and us can survive in this harsh world. We must decide for ourselves how to handle out old masters.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 1</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is orcish</li><li>has orcish minority trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Our Former Masters](../events/our_former_masters.md) happens</li> | [Our New Home](#goblin_new_home)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_new_nation">A New Nation</a><br />*We have done more than survived, we have thrived. Our society has grown from a disparate collection of clans and families into a sprawling young society. We've learned much and come far. But we have so much farther to go.* | <li>is not tribal</li> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_settling_down" for 20 years</li> | [Goblin Superiority](#goblin_superiority)<br />[Our Old Masters](#goblin_old_masters)<br />[The Selfish Amongst Us](#goblin_selfish_among_us)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_survivors">Survivors</a><br />*We've been beaten and slaughtered for all of history. But we survived. We were dragged to Escann, as nothing more than weak fodder to be thrown at the humans, but still we survived. After the Dookanson fell, we were left alone, broken, the weakest force in a realm of adventurers and orcs. But still, we survived.\n\nWe will continue to survive. We will take what we have learned here, and show we are more than just skulking monsters in the dark. We are survivors, and we rule these lands.* | <li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 125</li></ul> | <li>If has tag is B43:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_flying_hound_legacy" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If has tag is B41:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_earworm_legacy" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If has tag is B42:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_groundhawk_legacy" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If has tag is B44:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_flung_head_legacy" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If has tag is B46:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_grasshopper_muncher_legacy" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If has tag is B45:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_headwearer_legacy" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If has tag is Z20:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_hideguzzler_legacy" until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [The Goblin Warmachine](#goblin_warmachine)<br />[The Old Cities](#goblin_old_cities)<br />[A Goblin's Pride](#goblin_pride)<br />[Our Place In This World](#goblin_place_in_this_world)<br /> |

| <a name="goblin_remove_ambitious">Remove the Ambitious</a><br />*The peasants are restless. Goblins are, inherently, an easily scared people. At the first sign of danger or harm, the immediate reaction is to flee into a nearby cave. And where there's unrest and scared masses, there are many who would take advantage of them.\n\nThese goblins must be stopped. If we are to survive, we need to take out these ambitious, who would destroy us for their own personal gain.* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>prestige is at least 20</li> | <li>add adm power = 75</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_no_more_backstabbing" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="goblin_safe_homes">Safe, Secure Homes</a><br />*With the ambitious in our ranks gone, we now need to better calm the masses. Cries of the end times are common, and any force on the horizon is enough to terrify a good portion of our militia. In order to calm the panicked, we must protect them well.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "goblin_safe_homes" for 15 years</li> | [Remove the Ambitious](#goblin_remove_ambitious)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_selfish_among_us">The Selfish Amongst Us</a><br />*Perhaps we did not remove all of the ambitious from our ranks, after all. As we grow and thrive in this new world, there are many among us who would scramble to take what little scavenge they can find for their own personal collections and profits.\n\nThe most powerful and richest goblins among us refuse to share with the chieftan and leaders, refusing to help us with our goals. Some leaders believe if we leave them to their own devices, they could still be useful. But others think we should repurpose their ill-gotten gains.* | <li>share of starting income is at least 2.0</li> | <li>the event [The Selfish Goblin](../events/the_selfish_goblin.md) happens</li> | [Safe, Secure Homes](#goblin_safe_homes)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_pride">A Goblin's Pride</a><br />*Goblins have often been slaves to the larger folk, used as fodder in mines, or on farms. While we loath this history, we have to admit we are quite good at it. In spite of the troubled history of our people, we are one of the best when it comes to creating goods, whether to sell, eat, or use.\n\nWe should build up the economy and production lines in our new nation, and live up to this deep seated pride in all goblins!* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>base production is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "goblin_growing_industry" for 15 years</li> | [A New Nation](#goblin_new_nation)<br /> |

| <a name="goblin_edible_things">Things That Are Edible</a><br />*Even disorganized hordes need to eat. Luckily these new lands are rich in edible things. Not as many mushrooms here, and our elders whine for lack of their favorite mushrooms to munch on, but there are many new interesting foods to taste here. We must do our best to try and gather a sizable quantity.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is fur</li><li>trade goods  is wine</li><li>trade goods   is fish</li><li>trade goods    is livestock</li><li>trade goods     is grain</li></ul></ul> | <li>change government reform progress = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_rich_harvests" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="goblin_shiny_metals">Working With Shiny Metals</a><br />*Metals are not quite as abundant here as they were in the caves, but they are just as necessary to possess, if not more. We should look to collect some, so we may continue our tinkering on these new Cannorian weapons we keep scavenging!* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 1</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>trade goods  is copper</li></ul></ul> | <li>change government reform progress = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_gobbo_metallurgy" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="goblin_weapons_fit">Weapons Fit For A Goblin</a><br />*Swords are not quite right for a Goblin. Bows are too unwieldy. Don't even get me started on battle axes.\n\nThe right weapon has avoided us for centuries, but in this new land, we have discovered something that fascinates us, and can help us turn the tides of war. Whether it be shot from a cannon, or flung from a hand, nothing changes the tide of battle quite like a good explosion.* | <li>mil tech is at least 7</li><li>innovativeness is at least 5</li> | <li>change government reform progress = 20</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_bombflingers" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="goblin_fighting_like_a_goblin">Fighting Like a Goblin</a><br />*Fighting in the caves was so easy. In the cramped tunnels of the Serpentspine, we could simple overwhelm the enemy in a swarm. The surface is... so wide, so open. We need to develop new tactics, before we are overwhelmed, ourselves.* | <li>any known country:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 1.5</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "goblin_fighting_like_a_goblin" for 20 years</li> | [Safe, Secure Homes](#goblin_safe_homes)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_neighbors_usefulness">Neighbor's Usefulness</a><br />*While many Cannorians want little more than to chase us away with violence, we have come across a few who are willing to trade what we need for what we already have. This trade seems like it could be very useful.... Perhaps we could be good at this.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>811:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>840:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>785:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>229:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>872:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>888:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add years of income = 0.5</li><li>country gets the modifier "goblin_shrewd_traders" for 20 years</li> | [The Selfish Amongst Us](#goblin_selfish_among_us)<br /> |
| <a name="goblin_place_in_this_world">Our Place In This World</a><br />*As we discover more about the history of this world we now find ourselves in, we must ask new, uncomfortable questions about our place in this world. Are we little more than hordes of monsters, here to pillage and raid? Or can we be more?\n\nWe must determine, once and for all, the measure of a goblin.* | <li>has institution renaissance</li> | <li>the event [The Measure of a Goblin](../events/the_measure_of_a_goblin.md) happens</li> | [A New Nation](#goblin_new_nation)<br /> |
