| <a name="Y01_harimari_fort">The Harimari Fortress</a><br />*Of all the squabbling city-states of Yanshen, there is perhaps none other like Hubao. The decrepit corpse of the old harimari empire, the statelet has managed to retain a vestige of its predecessor's organization and is capable of, even now, mustering armies strong enough to give our probing forces pause. We need to stomp them out now, while they are unable to defeat a true oni army.* | <li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>area is moryokang_area</li></ul> | <li>4901:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azjakuma_southern_bulwark</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Ajgriijarul Training](#Y01_ajgriijarul_training)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_direct_control_tribute">Direct Control of Tributaries</a><br />*The lords of Yuanszi have been wise enough to bring tribute to Azjakuma, prostrating themselves and bearing gifts. There is nothing wrong with this. However, with the threat of the Command looming, their strength must be fully joined to ours. They will understand, in due time.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Y89:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Y01:</li><ul><li>is subject of type with overlord:</li><ul><li>Y89</li><li>type is tributary_state</li></ul></ul><li>is not subject</li></ul></ul><li>Y89:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 20</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Y89:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 25</li></ul> | <li>If has Y89 has exists; and has Y01 is subject of type with overlord has who is Y89, and is subject of type with overlord has type is tributary state; and is not subject:</li><ul><li>the event [The Yuanszi](../events/the_yuanszi.md) happens</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If mogutian area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [The Harimari Fortress](#Y01_harimari_fort)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_expand_record_keeping">Expand Record Keeping</a><br />*One of the prides of the oni is our extensive record-keeping, dating back millennia. Any work, any event, of interest to the kingdom has been logged and stored - and, unlike the efforts of a certain group, it has stayed intact. Yet the organization of these works is haphazard, improvised, a temporary solution pretending to be a permanent one. These records will need to be sorted out and well organized if they are to be of any use.* | <li>4813:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier azjakuma_expanded_record_keeping for 40 years</li> | [Direct Control of Tributaries](#Y01_direct_control_tribute)<br /> |

| <a name="Y01_ajgriijarul_training">Ajgriijarul Training</a><br />*The Shirgrii of the Ajgriijarul are some of the strongest warriors in Haless, perhaps even in all of Halann. If one so desired, they might well tear a human in half, or rip their head off and take the spine with it. More than just simple raw strength, though, the Ajgriijarul understand warfare very intimately. Their displays of violence and bloodshed seem mindless, even chaotic, but this cannot be further from the truth: each gruesome death is carefully choreographed in order to create the most intimidating warrior possible.\n\nAlthough they are too few to form our entire army, coaxing them to share their secrets by training the less-skilled will afford us an invaluable asset.* | <li>4829:</li><ul><li>development is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier azjakuma_bright_claw_warriors for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="Y01_expel_rebellious">Expel the Rebellious</a><br />*The harimari of these new lands are some of the staunchest followers of the foreign "High Philosophy", their heraldry immediately recognizable from the countless expeditions they have led against the oni. Even now they conspire to remove our rule. Expel the harimari, expunge them and replace them with subjects who will be more pliable to our regime.* | <li>moryokang area:</li><ul><li>owned by is Y01</li><li>has owner religion</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is horned_ogre</li><li>culture  is hill_yan</li></ul><li>is year is at least 1485</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If moryokang area has nationalism is 1, and  has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azjakuma_expelled_rebellious</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [The Harimari Fortress](#Y01_harimari_fort)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi">Cursed Souls of Khelorvalshi</a><br />*The Khelorvalshi have evolved following their collective banishment, having absorbed their surroundings to create a Shirgrii as unique as any other, a Shirgrii of madmen, lunatics, and maniacs - but resourceful, scholastic, and inventive as well. Obviously, they could threaten the established social order of the oni. Yet, even so, they present an opportunity, should the reward for the risk prove sufficient.* | <li>owns core province 4848</li> | <li>4848:</li><ul><li>change culture = horned_ogre</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>change province name = "Khelorvalshi"</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>rename capital = "Khelorvalshi"</li></ul></ul><li>the event [The Cursed Souls of Khelorvalshi](../events/the_cursed_souls_of_khelorvalshi.md) happens</li> | [Expel the Rebellious](#Y01_expel_rebellious)<br />[Infiltrating Heiyukcheng](#Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi">Restoring Khelorvalshi</a><br />*Khelorvalshi, named for the Shirgrii that resided within, has finally had its time come. The city has been left in ruins, considered cursed and looted by scavengers and 'adventurers' alike. The oni have no such qualms about resettling their own lands, for it is cursed only for our lesser rivals. A permanent settlement will enable Azjakuma to survey what has been lost.* | <li>owns core province 4848</li><li>4848:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul> | <li>4848:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azjakuma_shirgrii</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Cursed Souls of Khelorvalshi](#Y01_cursed_souls_khelorvalshi)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries">Khelorvalshi Libraries</a><br />*The greatest reward for the resettlement of Khelorvalshi is easily its libraries - vast stores of knowledge remain hidden within its boundaries, the manifests and codices certainly considered too cursed to tamper with. Renovating the city further will give us free leave to pilfer the knowledge within and record it within our own state libraries, whilst leaving the Shirgrii without this potentially-destabilizing information.* | <li>owns core province 4848</li><li>adm power is at least 85</li><li>dip power is at least 85</li><li>mil power is at least 85</li> | <li>add adm power = -85</li><li>add dip power = -85</li><li>add mil power = -85</li><li>the event [The Knowledge of Khelorvalshi](../events/the_knowledge_of_khelorvalshi.md) happens</li> | [Expand Record Keeping](#Y01_expand_record_keeping)<br />[Restoring Khelorvalshi](#Y01_restoring_khelorvalshi)<br /> |

| <a name="Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters">Chumijemoya Spymasters</a><br />*The Chumijemoya are incredibly effective spymasters. There is little more to be said about them, for there is nowhere their ears cannot reach, and a grudge from them is lethal indeed. They are something of an anomaly, to put it politely, for there are no other oni able to rival their ability to gather information - masters of extortion, torture, domination magic, and simple contact networks, little stays unknown by them if they desire to know it. However, their position has brought them to become indolent in recent years - no more! Their services shall be put to the use of the Rashenbir without a moment's delay!* | <li>4831:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>spymaster is at least 1</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_chumijemoya</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = azjakuma_silent_mist_spymasters_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [oni_silent_mist_privilege](../flags/oni_silent_mist_privilege.md)</li><li>5409:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azjakuma_aikogeoke_natives</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>hidden = yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Ajgriijarul Training](#Y01_ajgriijarul_training)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_infiltrate_eunuch_council">Infiltrating Heiyukcheng</a><br />*The so-called "Eternal Council" of Jinqiu are squatters, looters, and vultures beyond measure. The very land they attempt to rule over is the former domain of the Khelorvalshi, a Shirgrii considered extinct, made exclusively of banished oni. More than a few of these were banished for academic reasons - that is to say, they peddled in knowledge befitting not even the oni. The eunuchs of Jinqiu have doubtlessly seized their research and turned it to their own twisted ends; namely, so that even without a dynasty, they may live forever.\n\nSuch greed does not come without cost, however. They are greedy, capricious, and manipulable. To send the Chumijemoya after them will be an affair that is almost too easy, and even simpler still to corrupt their council and drag it down to where it belongs.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>4848:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li><li>is subject of type is tributary_state</li></ul></ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of type is tributary_state</li></ul></ul></ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>owns 4848</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = azjakuma_perma_claims_on_owned_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If jinqiu area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If balrijin area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT; and  has country or non sovereign subject holds is Y02:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Chumijemoya Spymasters](#Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_winning_over_birb">Winning Over the Shuvüüsh</a><br />*No sound individual would say that the Shuvüüsh would accept us easily - indeed, to the Righteous Path we are all the foulest demons, embodying everything wrong with the world. The Shuvüüsh, an example of piety, would obviously be vehemently against our rule. Of course, all mortals might be corrupted. The rejection of the oni is not total, and that is opportunity enough to creep in.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azjakuma_birb_conquered_decade_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [birb_conquered_decade](../flags/birb_conquered_decade.md)</li></ul><li>accepted culture is shuvuush</li> | <li>custom tooltip = azjakuma_birb_rejection_to_caution_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has province modifier is azjakuma birb rejection:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = azjakuma_birb_rejection</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azjakuma_birb_caution</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>clr country flag [oni_birb_rejection_setup](../flags/oni_birb_rejection_setup.md)</li><li>set country flag [oni_birb_caution_setup](../flags/oni_birb_caution_setup.md)</li><li>the event [Full Integration of the Shuvüüsh](../events/full_integration_of_the_shuvuush.md) happens</li></ul> | [Bring the Bird Riders to Heel](#Y01_bring_birb_to_heel)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_birb_auxillaries">Bird Rider Auxillaries</a><br />*Patience brings success. A not insignificant amount of the Shuvüüsh have come around to our rule, swayed by security and stability - under the yoke, obviously. They contribute their dues, pay taxes, participate in state-sponsored functions, and, most importantly, have stopped trying to hide from conscription duties. A unit of Lefthand bird-riders have been prepared and armed, ready to serve as auxiliaries for our forces.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is birb_aux_tooltip</li><li>5407:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5411:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5410:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5413:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5414:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5412:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5415:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5416:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul><li>5417:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul></ul> | <li>set country flag [oni_shuvuush_auxillaries](../flags/oni_shuvuush_auxillaries.md)</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_shuvuush_auxillaries</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Winning Over the Shuvüüsh](#Y01_winning_over_birb)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_way_forward">The Way Forward</a><br />*What will become of the Oni? As the matters of state become more than that of managing squabbling clans, and as Azjakuma must spend more of its time governing and exploiting new subjects over tending to the Demon Hills, this question only becomes more intense. The Rashenbir chafes, for the Shirgrii jealously guard old privileges even as they become anathema to the new Azjakuma. Perhaps one last meeting of the Tagharoghi will do us well...* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>reform level is at least 2</li> | <li>the event [The Final Meeting of the Tagharoghi](../events/the_final_meeting_of_the_tagharoghi.md) happens</li> | [Khelorvalshi Libraries](#Y01_khelorvalshi_libraries)<br />[Bird Rider Auxillaries](#Y01_birb_auxillaries)<br />[Defend the North](#Y01_defend_north)<br /> |

| <a name="Y01_aikogeoke">Aikogeoke</a><br />*The lands known as Aikogeoke, conveniently shaped similarly to one of our own internal provinces, have remained uncontrolled for centuries. The lands are a substantial distance from any Shirgrii, and until now none have seen anything desirable in those sparse, pastoral lands.\n\nWith the world rumbling with change, this too must come to an end. Instead of any Shirgrii, the state itself shall take an interest in these lands. It shall provide a formidable border fort, and perhaps even a redoubt against any invading forces.* | <li>5409:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is at least 1</li><li>infantry in province  is Y01</li></ul> | <li>If has 5409 is not city, and 5409 is not a colony:</li><ul><li>5409:</li><ul><li>add siberian construction = 500</li><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = Y01</li><li>type = infantry</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Chumijemoya Spymasters](#Y01_chumijemoya_spymasters)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_bring_birb_to_heel">Bring the Bird Riders to Heel</a><br />*The terrorbird riders, infamous raiders and fanatical warriors, have proven themselves a menace once more. United under the auspices of an enigmatic new queen, their mounted hosts march in ever-greater numbers and with ever-better discipline. Indeed, if they are allowed to muster their forces to match their potential and given the resources to supply them, the age of the bird might well dawn soon.\n\nThere is one critical weakness these birds possess, however - they require a specialized feed that requires the use of cereals. Should their grain-producing lands be seized, then their forces will surely be starved out. See it done.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azjakuma_bring_birb_to_heel_tooltip</li><li>choogiaza area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>yunghuun area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>5412:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>5415:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Missing localisation: flavor_azjakuma_1_t](../events/missing_localisation_flavor_azjakuma_1_t.md) happens</li></ul> | [Aikogeoke](#Y01_aikogeoke)<br /> |

| <a name="Y01_adapting_oni_state">Adapting the Oni State</a><br />*The single fatal flaw of the oni is our natural isolation. Numbers notwithstanding, most tend to congregate into Shirgrii and tend to their own villages and towns, paying little regard for the affairs of others. As shown by recent successes, it is only by mixing the Shirgrii that the oni can survive. New cities, new roads, the state shall be adapted to mend these flaws. A series of new, planned cities will serve to connect the oni better than ever before.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is demon hills region, and  has terrain is hills:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azjakuma_expanding_infrastructure</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = azjakuma_adapting_oni_state_tooltip</li> |  |
| <a name="Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary">Kabiurgarko Tributaries</a><br />*The Kabiurgarko are infamous for their greed, going to extreme lengths to preserve and grow their wealth. The most famous of their exploits was the creation of great record-keeping systems, meticulously recording all tribute extracted, and from where it came, in order to maximize their wealth intake. Naturally, that makes them a natural Shirgrii for tax collection. With the right deals, they can be brought around to utilize their skills to collect all that is due - and no less - from our subjects.* | <li>4828:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 8</li></ul> | <li>4828:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azjakuma_expanded_tributary_system</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Adapting the Oni State](#Y01_adapting_oni_state)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_teimarji_spring">The Teimarji Spring</a><br />*Teimarji is a glowing blue rock which enhances an individual's magical power. When properly treated, the now black substance can do the exact opposite to great effect. However, it needs to be present to enable this - the rock only comes from the sky, and in exceedingly small amounts. Whatever can be found needs to be harvested.\n\nThe Shinukhorchi have an intrinsic link to the material, being capable of reaching out with their spirits over short distances to 'feel' for it. A deposit was discovered near the capital, creating springs of magically amplified water. Dig it up.* | <li>5430:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_shinukhorchi</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_shinukhorchi</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = shinukhorchi_magic_korashi_unlock_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [korashi_talismans_unlocked](../flags/korashi_talismans_unlocked.md)</li></ul> | [Kabiurgarko Tributaries](#Y01_kabiurgarko_tributary)<br /> |
| <a name="Y01_golden_gates">Golden Gates of Hokuma</a><br />*Most people would be quick to describe themselves as pious, as righteous, as unwilling to contribute to their perceived evil. The truth of the matter is different. Cheap goods, attainable luxuries, a week's pleasure for a day's work - these are the true desires of man.\n\nMost in Haless would attest the opposite, but many would buy oni goods if they were cheap and through a merchant or middleman; for then they might pretend that what they do is righteous. Ultimately, it is all the better - for us!* | <li>4828:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_kabiurgarko</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>4828:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul> | [The Teimarji Spring](#Y01_teimarji_spring)<br /> |

With the newfound support base, it is obvious that the lands need to be exploited to their fullest. The food provided will ensure that the oni population may continue to grow even if all other sources of sustenance are snuffed out. Similarly, the increased output will allow for more soldiers to be raised.* | <li>years of income is at least 1.5</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add years of income = -1.5</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>custom tooltip = azjakuma_breadbasket_north_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is shuvuushudi region, and  has trade goods is grain:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>set country flag [oni_birb_immigration_allowed](../flags/oni_birb_immigration_allowed.md)</li></ul> | [Bring the Bird Riders to Heel](#Y01_bring_birb_to_heel)<br />[Golden Gates of Hokuma](#Y01_golden_gates)<br /> |

The hobgoblins grow impatient with us, frustrated and angry at our continued sovereignty. If we were to allow the Command to have its way, the oni would be ground to dust under a legion of hobgoblin boots - but that is a delusion born of false strength.\n\nShatter the command, show them that no discipline can stop them from being lesser!

| <a name="Y01_southern_rethagi">A Southern Rethagi</a><br />*The southern extent of Yanshen is covered in large expanses of jungle, owing to its proximity to the Lupulan. It is a stubborn land, for foliage can regrow very quickly. Because of this, administrating the area has proven difficult - delays in communication are frequent, and roads are often discovered to be inoperable. The terrain also makes guerilla operations against our agents difficult to combat.\n\nDecentralizing the administration would make the area easier to govern, at least until taming the plant life is plausible; a Rethagi might be able to exploit the region more efficiently - reintegration would be out of the question, though.* | <li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>superregion is yanshen_superregion</li><li>has terrain jungle</li></ul><li>Y23:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Governance of Southern Yanshen](../events/governance_of_southern_yanshen.md) happens</li> | [The Bianfang Faithful](#Y01_bianfang_faithful)<br /> |

Of what is there, the sustainable rate of mining is far higher than anything the goblins are currently doing. By incentives and investments, the scale of resource extraction can be multiplied several times. These metals can be rerouted into renovations of Senukagrii, which is sorely in need of metal to better fortify the structure of the building.
