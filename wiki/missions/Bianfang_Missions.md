| <a name="bianfang_fortress_with_a_state">Fortress with a State</a><br />*Military scholars say that supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting. As mighty as our army is, rushing headlong into a full frontal assault of Hubao, or the Tiger Fort as the Harimari that compose the fortress’s defenders call it, would be suicide.\n\nTherefore, we must capture the fort through other means. We will sever their supply lines, raid nearby farming settlements, and lay waste to their fortifications with siege weaponry. We must break their will, all without having to shed a drop of blood, and leave them no choice but to surrender to the might of the Bianfang.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>4901:</li><ul><li>owned by is Y03</li></ul><li>Country is Y09</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Y03:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>4901:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4901:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has 4901 has owned by is Y03:</li><ul><li>the event [Overture to the Tiger Fort](../events/overture_to_the_tiger_fort.md) happens</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 10</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="bianfang_frontier_fortress">The Frontier Fortress</a><br />*With the so-called Tiger Fort firmly under our control and its previous defenders sufficiently pacified, we must begin to fortify our position, lest we lose our newfound gains to the hobgoblins of the Command or the barbarous Oni to the north. Many of the fort’s previous defenders have begrudgingly, yet wisely, kneel and bow before our King and vowed to earn their place in Bianfang. Despite their oaths of loyalty, we will entrust one of our finest Marshals to oversee the building of fortifications and ensure that the Tiger Fort remains solely under our control.* | <li>4901:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>4901:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bianfang_hulibao_fortified</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Fortress with a State](#bianfang_fortress_with_a_state)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_an_iron_fortress">A Fortress of Iron</a><br />*Our faithful Marshal who we have placed in charge of the Tiger Fort reports that the Harimari are slowly adjusting to our rule. Even more, the previous quartermaster of the fort has revealed the location of an iron mine not far from the fort itself.\n\nIt would be foolish for us to not take advantage of this opportunity, and a team has already been dispatched to scout out the mine. Our military engineers have recommended that we use this newfound resource to aid in the ongoing building of fortifications in Hubao, further strengthening our bulwark against both any potential Oni and hobgoblin aggressors.* | <li>4901:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>province has current tech fort trigger is yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li> | <li>4901:</li><ul><li>If has building is fort 15th:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_16th</li><li>speed = 2</li><li>cost = 2</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has building is fort 16th:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_17th</li><li>speed = 2</li><li>cost = 2</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has building is fort 17th:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_18th</li><li>speed = 2</li><li>cost = 2</li></ul></ul></ul><li>4826:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>small increase of harimari tolerance effect = yes</li> | [The Frontier Fortress](#bianfang_frontier_fortress)<br />[Greater Discipline](#bianfang_greater_discipline)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_dragons_banner">Dragon's Banner</a><br />*Our army continues to grow with each passing day, and while eastern Xianjie is firmly within our grasp, we have greater aspirations than just the farmlands and monasteries we have conquered. A great military theorist once said that to know your enemy, you must become your enemy, and after poring over the endless reports about the Command’s military tactics, we have given the orders down the military chain of command to begin implementing the military model of the Command.\n\nOur warriors must fight with unmatched savagery, and be willing to die for our nation. This paradigm shift will not come without costs, however, but we have long since accepted the fact that adopting this new model will separate the wheat from the chaff.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.4</li></ul><li>army size is at least 60</li><li>army tradition is at least 40</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 25</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add yearly manpower = -1</li><li>add army tradition = -10</li><li>remove country modifier = bianfang_army_buff_2</li><li>country gets the modifier bianfang_army_buff_3 until otherwise removed</li> | [Monstrous Drill](#bianfang_monstrous_drill)<br /> |

| <a name="bianfang_an_opening">An Opening</a><br />*War has come to the Xianjie, and the First Master of the Xia has called upon the Righteous Masters to answer the call. In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity, and thus, we put our machinations into action. Already our agents embedded deep within eastern Xianjie begin to scout the lands and sow discontent.\n\nWe must throw the eastern fringes of the Xia into disarray and attempt to sever lines of communication between the eastern monks and the heart of the Xia, so that when it comes time for our forces to march, we march against a divided, ill-prepared foe.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>has reform wulin</li></ul></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>has reform wulin</li><li>is at war</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier bianfang_western_expedition for 15 years</li><li>If tietyuan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If wangqiu area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If aoshan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="bianfang_subjugate_the_monks">Subjugate the Monks</a><br />*The proud warrior monks of Xianjie perch across our border, tempting our people into disobedience, even revolt. They claim that even the lowliest peasant, through study and practice, can become as powerful as the greatest of lords.\n\nDespite all of the knowledge supposedly stored in their temples and libraries, these monks clearly need to be taught a lesson in the error of their ways. Our teaching shall not be imparted with a pen, but a sword.* | <li>tietyuan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>wangqiu area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>aoshan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [Fate of the Monasteries](../events/fate_of_the_monasteries.md) happens</li> | [An Opening](#bianfang_an_opening)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_greater_discipline">Greater Discipline</a><br />*Mighty as our army may be, many loyal soldiers have been felled by the Xia dogs during our conquest of the outer reaches of Xianjie. Though for every one soldier we lose in battle, ten loyal sons and daughters of Yanshen answer our call and take up arms to assist us in laying waste to the rest of the Xia that so desperately cling onto their so-called Righteous Path.\n\nBut we cannot achieve such a goal with sheer numbers. They say that victorious warriors win first, and then go to war. With our great army must come great discipline, and our warriors must fight as one. Weakness and hesitation must be purged from our ranks.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.2</li></ul><li>num of infantry is at least 30</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier bianfang_army_buff_1 until otherwise removed</li><li>add yearly manpower = 1</li> | [Subjugate the Monks](#bianfang_subjugate_the_monks)<br />[The Frontier Fortress](#bianfang_frontier_fortress)<br />[Down the Yan River](#bianfang_down_the_yan)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_monstrous_drill">Monstrous Drill</a><br />*The barbaric hobgoblins of the Command, as savage as they may be, have not established the position they currently hold by sheer luck. Even by our standards, the military might of the Command is something to be admired, and our effort to send scouts and spies to the region are beginning to bear fruit.\n\nCountless reports have come in over the last few weeks characterizing the Command as an entirely militaristic civilization, and every facet of their society is to strengthen, aid, and reinforce their military endeavors. Seemingly every hobgoblin is a warrior first and foremost, with everything else coming second to warfare.\n\nScouts who have watched their training exercises write home about how unified and cohesive they fight as a unit, no matter how small or large their fighting force is. As much as it pains us to admit it, there is much we can learn from their model.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is The Command</li><li>exists  is Lot Dekkhang</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bianfang_has_hob_majority_minority_tt</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has any hobgoblin pop trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>R62:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>Y58:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>medium increase of hobgoblin tolerance effect = yes</li><li>4826:</li><ul><li>add hobgoblin minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>If has dlc is "Cradle of Civilization":</li><ul><li>add army professionalism = 0.05</li></ul><li>remove country modifier = bianfang_army_buff_1</li><li>country gets the modifier bianfang_army_buff_2 until otherwise removed</li> | [Greater Discipline](#bianfang_greater_discipline)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_matchlock_warfare">Matchlock Warfare</a><br />*Our military scientists have recently made a groundbreaking development that they claim will propel our military conquests to new heights. This new invention, which can be best described as a handheld cannon that is fired by lighting a short, twine fuse, has been proved to be incredibly effective at short ranges.\n\nIt is clear to us that we now have the upper hand on the field of battle, and pushing our advantage as much as we reasonably can would be wise. Therefore, we must quickly scramble to produce as many of these powerful weapons as we can before our foes can level the playing field.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of infantry is at least 40</li><li>years of income is at least 1</li> | <li>add years of income = -1</li><li>country gets the modifier bianfang_matchlock_adoption for 20 years</li> | [Monstrous Drill](#bianfang_monstrous_drill)<br /> |

| <a name="bianfang_increase_conscription">Increase Conscription</a><br />*While we may boast that we have the most well-equipped, disciplined, trained army in all of Yanshen, we must further bolster our numbers if we are to achieve our goal of bringing all of Yanshen under our rule. To see to this, we must conscript young, able-bodied warriors of Bianfang.\n\nAs much as some may protest, they will soon realize that the only way we will unite the Yan people is to build an unstoppable military and conquer all those who stand against us. Conquering the bordering Jingqiu provinces to the north would be an excellent first test for our newly conscripted warriors, as well as establishing a foothold for further conquests in the area.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.6</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 6</li><li>base manpower is at least 4</li></ul> | <li>If bianfang area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If anjiang area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If jiangszun area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier bianfang_marching_down_the_yan for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="bianfang_down_the_yan">Down the Yan River</a><br />*As many have expected, our foes to the north have capitulated to our military might. Among our newly conquered lands is the city of Jincheng, the seat of the Jiangshi that have, until now, bestowed their wisdom upon Jingqiu for centuries.\n\nNow that the dust has settled, we must now decide what to do about the Jiangshi. Some of our more practical advisors suggest we allow their continued existence in exchange for their assistance in the continued pacification of the people of Jincheng. Others advocate that we eliminate the Jiangshi and their subjects to strengthen our grasp on the city.* | <li>bianfang area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>anjiang area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>jiangszun area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If linyuan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If yanzhong area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If hongnguan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Courts of the Jiangshi](../events/courts_of_the_jiangshi.md) happens</li> | [Increase Conscription](#bianfang_increase_conscription)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_storm_the_palaces">Storm the Palaces</a><br />*With our northern front secured, it is time we direct our conquest further down the Yan River, into the land of the eunuchs. While they have lorded over Yanshen as Harimar’s glorified tax collectors, Harimar is no longer here to protect these weak little men.\n\nThese uppity, opportunistic rulers think themselves safe in their little so-called League of Yanszin, but it’s time we show them what true power is and oust them from their palaces. Our advisors have reminded us that while their army is undoubtedly no match for ours, the eunuchs still wield a considerable amount of political sway in Yanshen, and we’ll need to determine their fate sooner rather than later.* | <li>linyuan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>yanzhong area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>hongnguan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier bianfang_yan_river_secured for 15 years</li><li>If jinqiu area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If balrijin area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Fate of the Eunuchs](../events/fate_of_the_eunuchs.md) happens</li> | [Down the Yan River](#bianfang_down_the_yan)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_great_cities">Great Cities of the South</a><br />*Through our military conquests, we have acquired large swaths of land that have unfortunately borne the burden of war. With our position as the dominant power in all of Yanshen secured, now is a time for rebuilding.\n\nGreat, prosperous cities will rise from the ashes of our newly conquered land, while settlements, towns, and cities in the heartland of our growing nation continue to grow, prosper, and thrive. When all of Yanshen is finally united under our rule, Bianfang will be home to the greatest cities in all of Haless.* | <li>4826:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4842:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4846:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4859:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>4826:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bianfang_urban_population_influx</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier bianfang_urbanization for 25 years</li> | [Storm the Palaces](#bianfang_storm_the_palaces)<br /> |

| <a name="bianfang_court_of_the_eunuch_king">Court of the Eunuch King</a><br />*Xiyun is a strange kingdom. Nephew succeeds uncle, their power is rooted in impotence, and the king lacks more than one kind of scepter. Yet they may prove to be a valuable ally against the savage tea drinkers and press-ganging whalers to the south, as we guard Yanshen against demons and hobgoblins to the north.\n\nWe rightly backed the reigning Xi dynasty against the rebellious eunuchs in the Xiyun Civil War. To continue cultivating our alliance with Xiyun, we should send emissaries to establish a permanent embassy in the Court of the Eunuch King.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Y21</li><li>Y21:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>Y21:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>4893:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>Y21:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is Y21:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = Y21</li><li>value = 15</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul><li>If jyutsai area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If wanglam area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If hungngon area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="bianfang_xiyun_reunification">Xiyun Reunification</a><br />*After assassinating Eunuch King Xi Juo in 1430 AA, the traitorous eunuchs and merchants fled Xiyun to the northern districts, proclaiming themselves to be the legitimate government. This upstart state of Luoyi is an affront to the rights of hereditary monarchs, and Xiyun remains vulnerable to outside threat and internal sedition.\n\nAs eunuchs, the Xi dynasty may be too weak to restore and rule their rightful territory without our strong guiding hand. A Treaty of Eternal Protection and Friendship will grant the lands to our south peace and tranquility under our benevolent guidance.* | <li>Y21:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>all core province:</li><ul><li>owned by is Y21</li></ul></ul> | <li>If iongsim area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have Y21 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>Y21:</li><ul><li>the event [Bianfang Offers Protection](../events/bianfang_offers_protection.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [Court of the Eunuch King](#bianfang_court_of_the_eunuch_king)<br /> |

While watching a young boy be ritually castrated may turn the stomachs of the virile men of Bianfang, we will nevertheless attend as his magnanimous protector and benefactor. Perhaps we should direct our officials in Xiyun to source the finest food and drink from the city’s merchants for the celebratory banquet. And, as the road between [From.Capital.GetCapitalName] and Xiyun may be unsafe, we should be sure to bring a retinue of hardened warriors...* | <li>4893:</li><ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>amount is at least 10</li></ul></ul><li>Y21:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 60</li></ul></ul><li>Y21:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of cities is at least 15</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Celebration](../events/the_celebration.md) happens</li> | [Xiyun Reunification](#bianfang_xiyun_reunification)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_imperial_capital">An Imperial Capital</a><br />*As Yanshen falls under our dominion, Bianfang is growing beyond being the mere guardian of its borders. What was once a provincial outpost now governs an empire.\n\nThe city smells of freshly milled lumber and baking bricks, and everywhere can be heard the shouts of construction foreman mixed with the chants of drilling soldiers and spirited bartering in the newly consecrated Grand Market. Our geomancers have laid plans with auspicious precision for new districts to house the countless peasants and laborers flocking to the city, and the Marshals who will govern them. To reign over it all, construction on a magnificent imperial palace to be clad in gold and porcelain has begun on a hill overlooking the Yanhe, a palace truly fit for the Dragon King. To be an empire worthy of the name, we must first devote the resources necessary to reshape Bianfang into an imperial capital.* | <li>owns core province 4826</li><li>4826:</li><ul><li>development is at least 45</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add splendor = 200</li><li>4826:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bianfang_capital_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Great Cities of the South](#bianfang_great_cities)<br />[The Waypoint Metropolis](#bianfang_waypoint_metropolis)<br /> |

| <a name="bianfang_facing_zyuhungwok">Facing Zyujyut</a><br />*The forest people to the south hold themselves above all other Yan, having resisted conquest by Harimar and Jaher. Their kings lounge on the Vermillion Throne and proclaim themselves to be blessed by the spirits as the only righteous rulers in Yanshen. Obviously, nothing could be further from the truth. They are in fact little more than petty cheiftans of tattooed savages, fond of tea and prostitutes, whose jungle has done far more to defend them from invaders than their magic swords.\n\nThe Zyujyut must now face the discipline and valor of Bianfang armies. The bounty from their tea gardens will fill our coffers, and their precious forests will fuel our forges.* | <li>jyutsai area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>wanglam area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>hungngon area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [Fate of the Zyujyut](../events/fate_of_the_zyujyut.md) happens</li> | [Court of the Eunuch King](#bianfang_court_of_the_eunuch_king)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_imperial_shipyard">An Imperial Shipyard</a><br />*The locals call the muddy, bustling port town at the mouth of the Zyusipgang River 'Cuihiok' - Clear Sunrise - an ironic name to bleary-eyed sailors and stevedores as they load small junks with crates of Jyutin tea and barrels of Xiyun gunpowder after a long night at the riverside taverns.\n\nAlthough Cuihiok is for now a mere collection of shacks, sheds, and rotting planks in comparison to the towering temples and vast dockyards of Tianlou, our royal engineers tell us the deep natural harbor could provide excellent anchorage for merchant vessels and warships. Most importantly, the Zyuhungjip Jungle upstream has enough timber for an armada to match the strength of our armies and rival the fleets of our enemies. Constructing shipyards and establishing a merchants quarter will bring the port to its full potential and allow us to project our might from the Bay of Buogoj to the Ringlet Sea.* | <li>owns core province 4884</li><li>4884:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul></ul> | <li>4884:</li><ul><li>change religion = high_philosophy</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bianfang_imperial_shipyard_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change province name = "Szinyugang"</li></ul> | [Facing Zyujyut](#bianfang_facing_zyuhungwok)<br /> |
| <a name="bianfang_waypoint_metropolis">The Waypoint Metropolis</a><br />*The town of Lamwun first coalesced around a High Temple, and has remained largely as a quick detour for academics and theologians on their way to the much grander High Temples of Tianlou. However, travelers on the road between [4826.GetName] and our newly expanded harbor at Szinyugang have found it to be the perfect midway point to rest and resupply. We should capitalize on Lamwun’s location by building toll roads and canals, and expand the town itself to ensure a steady flow of goods and people from the coast to the capital.* | <li>owns core province 4951</li><li>4951:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul></ul> | <li>4951:</li><ul><li>change religion = high_philosophy</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>4826:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bianfang_coastal_trade_influx</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [An Imperial Shipyard](#bianfang_imperial_shipyard)<br /> |
