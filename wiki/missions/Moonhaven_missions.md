| <a name="A31_varivar">Status of Varivari Elves</a><br />*Our fellow elves in Varivar have fallen under the rule of the traitorous Wexonards during the late stages of the Lilac War. The Wexonards are not known for having warm relations with us elves and it is unknown how they will treat our brethren. As the representatives of moon elves it is our duty to make sure that Varivari elves are not persecuted, either by reestablishing a contact with them should Wex grant them autonomy or petitioning the humans directly.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>monthly dip is at least 8</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Varivar</li><li>Z42:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Varivar</li></ul><li>A30:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is Z42:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 30</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>A30:</li><ul><li>the event [A Message From Moonhaven](../events/a_message_from_moonhaven.md) happens</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="A31_ibevar">State Visit to Ibevar</a><br />*Ibevar and Moonhaven have never been on the good terms, almost entirely due to ideological differences. The founder of Moonhaven, Varilor Bluetongue, promoted and idea of cannorization of moon elves and integration into human society. Meanwhile, Ibenion I - the founder of Ibevar - seeked to establish a purely elven realm in Cannor. Under some consideration, Varion 'The Young' has decided to arange a meeting with the Ibevari nobility, officially to 'bring forth the age of peace among moon elves.' There is however a personal issue behind this meeting, as Varion's uncle currently resides in Ibevar...* | <li>has ruler "Varion 'the Young'"</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>A32:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>change dip = 1</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>A32:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = A31</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul><li>the event [Two Bluetongues](../events/two_bluetongues.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="A31_anbenncost">Mission to Anbenncóst</a><br />*Anbenncóst, the capital of the Empire, was significantly damaged during the Lilac Wars. Our fellow elves of Anbenncóst have suffered too, and it is our duty as the elven elector to support them and provide relief. We should organise a state visit to Anbenncóst and provide help them in any way we can, such as inviting those who suffered in the war to settle in Port Munas. The two cities share many similarities and the change should be fairly painless.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A38:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Anbenncost</li></ul><li>is rival is Anbenncost</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add accepted culture = anbenncoster</li><li>If does not have rival is A38:</li><ul><li>A38:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = A31</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>52:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A31_lesser_anbenncost">Lesser Anbenncóst</a><br />*Port Munas has always been considered a smaller sibling city to Anbenncóst with the local human population having a similar identity to that of Anbenncósters. Our recent diplomatic mission to the imperial capital saw a city breathing with life, full of all kind of races found in the empire. We should aim to make Port Munas even more alike its sister city by inviting other races of Anbennar. Let Moonhaven have its own little Anbenncóst.* | <li>52:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li><li>development is at least 45</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num free building slots is at least 2</li></ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>52:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add half elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add gnomish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>small increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>small increase of half elven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>small increase of gnomish tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Mission to Anbenncóst](#A31_anbenncost)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_true_to_rc">True To the Regent Court</a><br />*The debate is over and one thing is clear - this Corinite heresy cannot stand and will not find support in Moonhaven. Munas ascended to the court led by Castellos and his son Adean, and he would most definitely support the rightful heir. And so must we, the Moon Elves, follow our founder. Unfortunately, some heretics are already present within our borders and we will have to deal with them first.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A31_stayed_rc</li><li>has country flag [A31_regent](../flags/a31_regent.md)</li></ul><li>religious unity is at least 1</li><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>stability is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of rebel armies is at least 1</li><li>num of rebel controlled provinces is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A31_rc_resistance" for 20 years</li> | [The Unraveling](#A31_unraveling)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_new_alliances">Form New Alliances</a><br />*The Corinites continue spreading their lies across the empire, threating the stability of Anbennar. Luckily, there are plenty of other righteous countries in the empire who stand with Adean and defy Corin and her rabid mob of followers. Just like the elves of past joined in arms with countries of Cannor to fight Nichmer so must we unite the empire in order to safeguard it from the Corinites.* | <li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = -150</li><li>add army tradition = 10</li><li>If every country has religion is regent court, and  has alliance with is A31:</li><ul><li>add army tradition = 10</li><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = A31</li><li>value = 30</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul> | [True To the Regent Court](#A31_true_to_rc)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_saving_misguided">Saving the Misguided</a><br />*To our north lie the lands of Istralore, our former ally and fellow supporter of House Silmuna and the Grand Duchy of Dameria. And now, their lands are overrun with Corinites, their soldiers praising her name. Our hearts are filled with sorrow for our misguided human comrades who were fed deceitful lies of Corin. But their oppression will soon end. We shall call upon our rangers and our allies and liberate Istralore from itself, bringing it back to the Regent Court. They will resist, but we know what is the best for them.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army tradition is at least 50</li><li>army professionalism is at least 0.6</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>army organiser is at least 2</li><li>army reformer is at least 2</li><li>commandant is at least 2</li><li>grand captain is at least 2</li><li>recruitmaster is at least 2</li><li>fortification expert is at least 2</li><li>quartermaster is at least 2</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Istralore</li><li>value is at least 0.75</li></ul> | <li>29:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>899:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>277:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>278:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>37:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A45</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 720</li></ul> | [Form New Alliances](#A31_new_alliances)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_liberating_brethren">Liberating Our Brethren</a><br />*With Istralore firmly secured under our protection we may now look at the rest of the empire. Both the Lilac Wars and the Corinite heresy have shown us the weakest parts of the empire and how shaky the elven security in Anbennar is. Moonhaven used to count on someone else to protect elves outside of Silverwoods, first Dameria and then Istralore. We lost Dameria and barely managed to bring Istralore back. This cannot stand. We will have to take action ourselves and implement direct control over elven lands in the empire if we are to ensure security and freedom of all moon elves.* | <li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A45:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Moonhaven</li><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Istralore</li></ul><li>owns 29</li><li>owns  899</li><li>owns   277</li><li>owns    278</li><li>owns     37</li></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = -300</li><li>If does not have exists is A45:</li><ul><li>release = A45</li></ul><li>create march = A45</li><li>add historical friend = A45</li><li>A45:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = A31</li></ul><li>335:</li><ul><li>add core = A31</li></ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>add core = A31</li></ul><li>357:</li><ul><li>add core = A31</li></ul><li>900:</li><ul><li>add core = A31</li></ul><li>256:</li><ul><li>add core = A31</li></ul><li>314:</li><ul><li>add core = A31</li></ul> | [Saving the Misguided](#A31_saving_misguided)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_shield_munas">Shield of Munas</a><br />*At long last, Moonhaven has secured its direct rule over almost all elves in the empire. Most fools that joined the Corinites have abandoned that vile heresy and those who didn't... well, they made their choice clear. Our realm is secure from within, and the time has come to secure it from all external threats too. Heretics are still a threat to the empire, and Moonhaven shall aid in striking this evil down.* | <li>335:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li><li>culture is moon_elf</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li><li>culture is moon_elf</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>357:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li><li>culture is moon_elf</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>900:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li><li>culture is moon_elf</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>256:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li><li>culture is moon_elf</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>314:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li><li>culture is moon_elf</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A31_shield_of_munas" for 50 years</li> | [Liberating Our Brethren](#A31_liberating_brethren)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_elven_place_empire">Elven Place in the Empire</a><br />*Our efforts at securing the safety of Anbennar have been a tremendous success. The dominance of Adean was secured in the empire and the corinites are now in retreat. And all of this is in large part due to our help. The new emperor wisely acknowledged the part our elven rangers played in securing their position and the defeat of corinites, and accepted our proposal of expanding elven towns across the empire. The empire is strong and the moon elves have great influence in Cannor. The time for peace and prosperity of moon elves has come. Our people are safe and will remain this way for as long as both Moonhaven and the Empire last.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army tradition is at least 75</li><li>army professionalism is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>is the emperor</li></ul><li>has country modifier hre_dominant_regent_court</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>custom tooltip = A31_place_dev</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is moon elf, and  is part of hre:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = A31_place_minority</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If europe is part of hre, and  has elven minority trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>random:</li><ul><li>chance = 50</li><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Shield of Munas](#A31_shield_munas)<br /> |

| <a name="A31_istralore">Istralore</a><br />*Istralore is a fellow remnant of Dameria and our closest ally.

| <a name="A31_unraveling">The Unraveling</a><br />*The recent revelations from Aelantir have sent shockwaves across Cannor and we in Moonhaven have felt it too. Everyone can feel a conflict coming and once again we will be plunged into it. Already, our closest friends and allies in Istralore have joined the Corinite movement and some of Her worshippers are now spreading around Moonhavener countryside with several elven officials demanding a resolution regardless the religious situation here. Moonhaven now must choose between two sides, and this choice will affect all moon elves in the empire.* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>is not at war</li><li>is religion enabled is corinite</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A45:</li><ul><li>religion is corinite</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Istralore</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Corinites in Moonhaven](../events/corinites_in_moonhaven.md) happens</li> | [Mission to Anbenncóst](#A31_anbenncost)<br />[Finish Recovering](#A31_finish_recovering)<br />[Istralore](#A31_istralore)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_new_path">The New Path</a><br />*After some debate we have decided that Moonhaven stands with Istralore and Corin! Munas would most certainly support Corin's cause, as when he arrived with elves to Cannor he led the fight against evil head on, just like the Corinites proclaim we shall do. Together with our human allies we shall spread Her word throughout the empire, to both humans and elves.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A31_went_corinite</li><li>has country flag [A31_corinite](../flags/a31_corinite.md)</li></ul><li>religious unity is at least 1</li><li>religion is corinite</li><li>stability is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of rebel armies is at least 1</li><li>num of rebel controlled provinces is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A31_conversion_zeal" for 20 years</li><li>A45:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "A31_conversion_zeal" for 20 years</li></ul> | [The Unraveling](#A31_unraveling)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_istralore_training">Istralorian Experience</a><br />*Istralania Warsinger was a close friend of Munas who founded the country of Istralore. Her legacy as a legendary warrior still persist in the hearts of Istralorian soldiers, known in Moonhaven for being excellent warriors. While our elven troops are also a prideful sight we could still learn something from our human cousins. We shall request Istralore to send us some of their officers to oversee our troops and share some of their military training.* | <li>mil is at least 4</li><li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>A45:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>army size is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>A45:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 200</li><li>the event [Officer Request From Moonhaven](../events/officer_request_from_moonhaven.md) happens</li></ul><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>add mil power = 300</li><li>country gets the modifier "A31_military_training" for 30 years</li> | [The New Path](#A31_new_path)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_population_exchanges">Population Exchanges</a><br />*The Grand Duchy of Dameria used to be a vast realm, containing both humans and elves. Now, its eastern part is split into Moonhaven and Istralore, an elven dominated and a human dominated realms. This divide affects our capability of working together as a single union and should be mitigated as soon as possible. A proposal was made by some of our advisors to exchange population with Istralore, creating a smoother transition between our states.* | <li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 4</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has idea group economic_ideas</li><li>economic ideas is at least 3</li></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>If random owned area has continent is europe:</li><ul><li>add human minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>medium increase of human tolerance effect = yes</li><li>A45:</li><ul><li>If random owned area does not have area is silverwoods area:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>medium increase of elven tolerance effect = yes</li></ul> | [Istralorian Experience](#A31_istralore_training)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_east_dameria">East Damerian Development</a><br />*Our efforts were successful and the both our realm and Istralore have experienced steady growth and expansion in recent years. But we could always do better. While Istralore is focused more on war in the name of Corin, Moonhaven shall focus on developing the lands of East Dameria where we live. By establishing a strong core we will have easier time to support our and Istralorian military endeavours.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>grown by development is at least 200</li><li>A45:</li><ul><li>grown by development is at least 200</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier "A31_damerian_development" for 5 years</li><li>A45:</li><ul><li>the event [Development of Dameria](../events/development_of_dameria.md) happens</li><li>country gets the modifier "A31_damerian_development" for 5 years</li></ul> | [Population Exchanges](#A31_population_exchanges)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_elven_auxillaries">Form Order of the Lamp</a><br />*There are many truly devout elves living in Moonhaven with the most widely worshipped Gods being Munas and the Dame, as is expected due to their history with elves and Moonhaven in particular. Due to the ongoing religious conflicts it has been proposed to more effectively utilize our zealots, for example sending them to help Istralore on their frontlines. And thus, Moonhaven has decided to form Order of the Lamp, who will be the shining light of Corinites in these dark times.* | <li>manpower percentage is at least 0.5</li><li>is at war with religious enemy</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>mil is at least 5</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li></ul> | <li>If does not have mil is 5:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -200</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "A31_auxillaries_moonhaven" for 75 years</li><li>A45:</li><ul><li>the event [Order of the Lamp](../events/order_of_the_lamp.md) happens</li><li>country gets the modifier "A31_auxillaries_istralore" for 75 years</li></ul> | [East Damerian Development](#A31_east_dameria)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_corin_light">Under Corin's Light</a><br />*Victory, at last! With our help the light of Corin has been spread and legitimised across the empire. Both elves and human alike now accept Her as the true successor to Castellos and not that weak and craven Adean. With our ally on the throne Moonhaven has risen in prominence across Anbennar too. With pride we could now say that the empire is strong and secure for elves and humans alike.* | <li>treasury is at least 750</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A45:</li><ul><li>is the emperor</li></ul><li>A58:</li><ul><li>is the emperor</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all province:</li><ul><li>is part of hre</li><li>culture is moon_elf</li><li>religion is corinite</li></ul><li>amount is at least 7</li></ul><li>religion is corinite</li><li>has country modifier hre_dominant_corinite</li> | <li>add treasury = -750</li><li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add splendor = 500</li><li>custom tooltip = A31_tax_elf</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If europe is part of hre, and  has elven minority trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul></ul><li>complete mission = A31_greater_revelation</li> | [Form Order of the Lamp](#A31_elven_auxillaries)<br /> |

| <a name="A31_redglades">Feast in Redglades</a><br />*Just a few years ago most of Anbennar was divided into two factions - the Moon Party that we were a part of and the Rose Party. During the Lilac Wars we ended up on the other side of the conflict with our brethren from the Elfrealm of the Redglades, and we since haven't properly reestablished out contacts with them. Our ruler, Varion 'The Young' has decided to personally attend this matter and sent a meesage asking to arrange a feast between our two countries in Redglades. If they do accept it will be the point of reconcilation of old wound, if any are still there.* | <li>has ruler "Varion 'the Young'"</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 75</li><li>A03:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 120</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Redglades</li></ul><li>A01:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = 30</li><li>add dip power = 30</li><li>add mil power = 30</li><li>the event [Elves of Two Forests](../events/elves_of_two_forests.md) happens</li><li>If has exists is A03:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -75</li><li>add prestige = 15</li><li>A03:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = A31</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -120</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A31_silent_repose">Wisdom From Silent Repose</a><br />*Silent Repose is a small moon elven community consisting primarily of the elder members of our race. While elves living there are primarily known as overly traditionalist and cranky folk they have something of great value for all elves - experience and wisdom. Those elves have witnessed countless historical events even by elven standards and can provide valuable insight into what was, what is and perhaps even what will be. In these times of change, both cultural and political, we have need of such elves.* | <li>has institution renaissance</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A83:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Silent Repose</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 75</li><li>350:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = philosopher</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>culture = moon_elf</li><li>religion = elven_forebears</li></ul><li>If does not have exists is A83:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -75</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A31_finish_recovering">Finish Recovering</a><br />*The Lilac War took a considerable toll on Moonhaven, with the dissolution of Dameria breaking costing us many souls. While it has ended more than a year ago our army has not fully recovered yet. Elven lives are precious and rarer than those of humans and we must focus on replenishing our reserves with young soldiers before any new conflict.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>num of generals is at least 1</li></ul><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.90</li> | <li>add army tradition = 5</li><li>country gets the modifier "thriving_arms_industry" for 25 years</li> |  |

We should get our hands on these samples and see and expand its production from being limited to just one city.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>2008:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>2008:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is Moonhaven</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_eordand</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tea</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have any subject country is colonial nation of is A31, and any subject country has capital scope has colonial region is colonial eordand:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -250</li><li>2008:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 250</li></ul></ul></ul><li>remove country modifier = A31_tea_hegemony_1</li><li>country gets the modifier "A31_tea_hegemony_2" until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = A31_new_hegemony_level</li> | [Origin of Our Samples](#A31_samples)<br /> |
| <a name="A31_harencel">Establish Harencel</a><br />*Our ships are now a frequent sight in many ports around Aelantir, moving goods from elven ancient homeland back to Cannor. But why stop at that? Why shouldn't Moonhavener fleets be seen all around Halann? Haless is said to contain plenty of riches desired in Cannor, and who but us should be the one to get them? But the journey to the east is long and risky, hence why we should establish a port somewhere around the many isles surrounding Sarhal.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>area is salahad_islands_area</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has area is salahad islands area, and  has development is 15, and  has dock building trigger is yes, and  has shipyard building trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li><li>rename capital = "Harencel"</li><li>change province name = "Harencel"</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "A31_around_sarhal" for 15 years</li> | [Eordan Herbal Tea](#A31_eordand_tea)<br />[Pieces of Elven History](#A31_elven_history)<br /> |

Our sailors report that the rumours were true and there are countless riches in Haless - porcelain, all manner of spices and even tea! We should not stop at this however and should establish a firm presence in Haless, either through diplomatic means or by conquest.* | <li>num of admirals is at least 1</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>continent is asia</li></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is asia</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Moonhaven</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Expansion Into Haless](../events/expansion_into_haless.md) happens</li> | [Establish Harencel](#A31_harencel)<br />[Exemplary Elven Navy](#A31_elven_navy)<br /> |

| <a name="A31_tea_hegemony">Moonhavener Tea Hegemony</a><br />*A retired human officer in Amadia, a sun elven landowner in Brasan, a Metsamic merchant and a half-elven noble in Anbenncóst. What do they all have in common? They all drink tea supplied by Moonhaven. This beverage is no longer limited just to the Damerian nobility. What once started as a few seeds inside a family locket has grown into something gorgeous. Our ships are sailing all across Halanna with their cargo being impossibly large supplies of tea, and bringing back profit to our home.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>trade goods is tea</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>trade goods is tea</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tea</li><li>country has this</li></ul><li>production leader:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tea</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>If every province has country or subject holds is ROOT, and  has trade goods is tea:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>If has country modifier is A31 tea hegemony 3:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = A31_tea_hegemony_3</li><li>country gets the modifier "A31_tea_hegemony_4" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>Else if has country modifier is A31 tea hegemony 4:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = A31_tea_hegemony_4</li><li>country gets the modifier "A31_tea_hegemony_5" until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = A31_new_hegemony_level</li> | [A Taste of Spice](#A31_rahen_tea)<br />[Second Origin of Tea](#A31_yanshen_tea)<br /> |
