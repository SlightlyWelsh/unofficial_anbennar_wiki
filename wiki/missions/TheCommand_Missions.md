| <a name="R62_the_war_room">The War Room</a><br />*The Great Command is a federation of the three clans: Boar, Wolf, and Lion. Across our nation, there are hundreds of fortifications, a dozen major hobgoblin cities, three great warcamps. But there is only one War Room.\n\nHere, the Marshals who rule each Command debate strategy and tactics. Here, the Grand Marshal sends the orders initiating the next campaign. And here, we remake the future of Haless.* | <li>num of generals is at least 3</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is ADM</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is DIP</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is MIL</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = command_meet_with_the_war_room_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The War Room: Kenu-Ike\n£icon_command_war_room_banners£\n[Root.GetCommandWarRoomBanner]](../events/the_war_room_kenu_ike_npsicon_command_war_room_bannersps_n_root_getcommandwarroombanner.md) happens</li><li>set country flag [command_war_room](../flags/command_war_room.md)</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="R62_prepare_the_troops">Prepare the Troops</a><br />*The scouts return to us with a clear picture of the terrain: rolling hills and verdant plains, perfect for marching through, with even seasons and familiar edible crops grown by the local populaces easily raided and used to feed our men.\n\nThe land at once appears simple and perhaps even serene, but it would be mistaken to assume the people are similarly so. Dedicated training halls for warriors of varying backgrounds and strategies populate the towns and cities, and every village is guarded by some militarized force. Knowledge on these fighting techniques is fragmented and sourced mostly from northern infiltrations, but there no doubt could be an endless amount of these strategies capable of catching our troops off-guard from villages uncountable.\n\nWith present knowledge, we estimate that these Xia states can field around two to three Kikun, a force as numerous as our own. A challenge for sure, and a worthy one for our new commander.* | <li>manpower is at least 40</li><li>num of generals is at least 3</li> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="R62_the_battle_of_shanyutian">The Battle of Shanyutian</a><br />*This is a post-battle report detailing the specifics of our victorious Xianje campaign, written approximately two months since our triumph at Shanyutian. Information presented is based on first-hand accounts of commanders and surviving frontline soldiers.\n\nThe Xia forces crashed upon our frontlines, pursuing combat with our troops with a supernatural fervor, those that were isolated into one-on-one combat were made into corpses. Our forces adapted quickly enough upon order from local commanders, ensuring that no deviation from an inter-locked shield wall was allowed, as our worgs and boar riders harried them with advances too quick to effectively counter.\n\nThe result was a victory, among the largest of the campaigns. Inserted beneath this report is an updated report of lost troops and armaments during the course of the battle, high command may find it peculiar.* | <li>4618:</li><ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 40</li></ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>amount is at least 10</li></ul><li>unit is in battle</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier command_the_battle_of_shanyutian for 30 days</li> | [Prepare the Troops](#R62_prepare_the_troops)<br /> |

| <a name="R62_start_the_xiadao_campaign">Start the Xiadao Campaign</a><br />*The land of the Xia is split among dozens of states, all vying for power under the yoke of a ruler with only nominal control over its internal tribes. Still, it appears that this nominal control is enough to bind its subjects to protect the ruler upon a war's declaration. Every last one of them, all pledged to defend the ruler of the Xia -- and in turn, the land itself -- to the last man.\n\nThis report puts forward a request to cease preparations and begin the campaign immediately. Based on present information, their forces can converge and unify within a matter of days. If we are to ensure a quick and decisive victory, we must act before the commander of the Xia can muster its splintered manpower into a united force capable of rivaling ours.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Province 4559 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li></ul></ul><li>4559:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Province 4559 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [The War Room](#R62_the_war_room)<br /> |
| <a name="R62_dissolve_the_mists">Dissolve the Mists</a><br />*The issue of the odd, "mystical" mists as described by some troops has come to a head. For too long have our troops met their end at an untimely matter, clashing head-to-head with a force neither guns nor steel can banish... so far.\n\nWe have identified sources of this mist, its properties derived from local legendary sites. Artificers under our employ, whose names and achievements can be seen in the attached parchment, have identified certain solutions for this ethereal menace, which we may be rid ourselves of with decisive action and a hefty sum to compensate these individuals. The northern Oni have also volunteered themselves to banish this mist with a degree of malevolent fervor, not that it concerns us what their reason may be, just that it be done as soon as possible.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>xianjie region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [Start the Xiadao Campaign](#R62_start_the_xiadao_campaign)<br /> |

Many will herald this moment as the day the war was won, and all the Xia were doomed to fall to our hands. The truth I may posit comes down to our superior management of supply lines and discipline, but I fear that may be a side of history that will go unremembered. The truth that the war was won the moment we set our eyes on this land ripe for conquest.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>region is xianjie_region</li><li>value is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>command complete campaign effect:</li><ul><li>campaign = xiadao</li></ul> | [Dissolve the Mists](#R62_dissolve_the_mists)<br /> |

As of the current date this is an incomplete report, much has been left unaccounted for, and looters from our less disciplined ranks can find themselves suffering from their impatience. One thing can be said for sure, however, and that is that these monks did not live as modestly as they claimed. Several tons of gold and precious stones have been smelted down and repurposed into bars, to be carted to the capital as soon as enough worgs can be procured for such a task.\n\nAnyway, beginning with the ornate combs...* | <li>controls is at least 4559</li><li>4559:</li><ul><li>has ruler leader from this nation</li></ul> | <li>random list:</li><ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>increase ruler adm effect = yes</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>increase ruler dip effect = yes</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>increase ruler mil effect = yes</li></ul></ul> | [Start the Xiadao Campaign](#R62_start_the_xiadao_campaign)<br /> |

The stragglers have been neutralized, all that remains now are silent fields and a subservient populace. The marches and mock battles that used to harry the townspeople with their grating, noisy disunity are gone - replaced with the melodious sound of hobgoblin troops patrolling the land.

The Marshals know this is unacceptable. We must therefore pacify the southern holdouts and cement our control over these fertile plains.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>shamakhad region:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>culture is shandibad</li></ul></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [The War Room](#R62_the_war_room)<br /> |
| <a name="R62_seize_the_ancient_cities">Seize the Ancient Cities</a><br />*While Shamakhad is an old and wealthy land, there are certain cities in this region that are older and wealthier than the rest. With these cities in our hands, we would be able to exert our authority over all of Shamakhad. Let us thus expand our dominion and incorporate these territories into this Great Command.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 4510</li><li>province id  is at least 4509</li><li>province id   is at least 4474</li><li>province id    is at least 4467</li><li>province id     is at least 4465</li><li>province id      is at least 4460</li><li>province id       is at least 4397</li></ul></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [Strike for Shamakhad](#R62_start_the_shamakhad_campaign)<br /> |

We have surrounded it, and its inhabitants are resisting us fiercely. One thing must be said, though; they fight well, and our casualties are mounting.\n\nThe time has come to commit to breaking Sarnihanpur, and our engineers have just the solution - a mammoth ramp, extending from the rolling plains that surround the city to arc over the walls. We will defend this ramp against all attacks, and once it is completed, we shall surge over the walls and put an end to this thorn in our side.* | <li>4460:</li><ul><li>sieged by is this nation</li><li>infantry in province is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>4460:</li><ul><li>change siege = 5</li></ul> | [Strike for Shamakhad](#R62_start_the_shamakhad_campaign)<br /> |

Its granaries have been yoked to our supply lines, and its vaults shall fund our future campaigns. Its people, too, shall labour on the fields and in our mines, in service to our Great Command.

| <a name="R62_construct_a_river_fleet">Construct A River Fleet</a><br />*The fortified city of Bianfang serves as a gate along the Yan river, greatly limiting our ability to supply troops downstream. One of the Sunyanin proposed the construction of the first hobgoblin river fleet to besiege Bianfang along the Yan while it is besieged from land. With the Grand Marshal’s approval, this plan will be put into motion and we will gain the upper hand in the siege of Bianfang.* | <li>mil power is at least 25</li><li>dip power is at least 25</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -25</li><li>add dip power = -25</li><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>4826:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = command_besieged_river_fleet</li><li>duration = 1825</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="R62_move_the_fleet_downriver">Move the Fleet Downriver</a><br />*According to our new subjects in Bianfang, Jincheng is the seat of the Eternal Council of Jingqiu. They claim that the eunuchs of Jingqiu practice dark magics and siphon the chi of others to sustain their own lives. Based on this information a request for more korashi chains has been made by the commanding officers and will be delivered before we move to subdue the city.\n\nOnce the river fleet has been repaired and a new set of chains have been imported, the river fleet shall move towards Jincheng. This two pronged assault will stretch the resources of the defenders thin and allow our forces to break through like they did in Bianfang.* | <li>controls is at least 4826</li> | <li>4842:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = command_besieged_river_fleet</li><li>duration = 1825</li></ul></ul> | [Construct A River Fleet](#R62_construct_a_river_fleet)<br /> |
| <a name="R62_the_third_city">The Third City</a><br />*Our reports on Szicheng suggest that it was originally built as an army camp to protect the nearby cities within the league of Yanszin. If seized, it could serve as a hub for our military operations in lower Yanshen. Therefore the river fleet must be employed again to seize this city and grant us access to a vital military center farther into Yanshen.\n\nOur generals, captains and lieutenants have become much more adept at utilizing the river fleet in conjunction with our kikun over the course of this campaign. The hardships faced and lessons learned from the first two excursions of the river fleet will allow us to employ more advanced maneuvers to overcome the defenses of Szicheng.* | <li>controls is at least 4842</li> | <li>4846:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = command_besieged_river_fleet</li><li>duration = 1825</li></ul></ul> | [Move the Fleet Downriver](#R62_move_the_fleet_downriver)<br /> |

Our intelligence has found that the Yan river is guarded by the city of Bianfang, meaning that it and the surrounding region must be secured before our advance into Yanshen can truly begin.\n\nTherefore the White Dragon of Bianfang has become our first obstacle to expansion in Yanshen, and their fall shall form the foundation of our operations in Yanshen.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>upper yanshen region:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is upper_yanshen_region</li></ul></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [The War Room](#R62_the_war_room)<br /> |
| <a name="R62_by_the_throat">By the Throat</a><br />*The siege of Bianfang has succeeded and the city is now firmly under our control. This has greatly weakened the warlord state of Bianfang and renders all the great cities of the Yan vulnerable to our forces.\n\nBianfang will serve as a key military base in our conquests of upper Yanshen. Additionally, it seems as though the warlord of Bianfang sought to unify Yanshen under their banner, with the city in our hands, the plans, intelligence and personnel that were being gathered for this can be repurposed to fit our ambitions in Yanshen.* | <li>Province 4826 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [Bianfang Belligerence](#R62_start_the_bianfang_campaign)<br /> |
| <a name="R62_the_superior_drill">The Superior Drill</a><br />*The armies of Bianfang possessed much greater organization and cohesion than any of the disorganized rabble we have faced so far. They fought with a unity and ferocity that approached the standards of a true hobgoblin kikun. Their commitment to order is admirable, but in the end they were unable to match the absolute discipline shown by our troops. While logistics and tactics were key in our triumph over Bianfang, we ultimately possessed the superior drill.\n\nWe have slain the White Dragon and with their fall all the realms down the Yan are open to the Great Command.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 12</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is jinqiu_area</li><li>area  is jiangszun_area</li><li>area   is bianfang_area</li><li>area    is bianyuan_area</li><li>area     is lamzung_area</li><li>area      is tianszi_area</li><li>province id is at least 4900</li><li>province id  is at least 4824</li><li>province id   is at least 4819</li><li>province id    is at least 4892</li></ul></ul><li>Province 4826 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li><li>owns or subject of  4842</li><li>owns or subject of   4846</li><li>owns or subject of    4951</li> | <li>command complete campaign effect:</li><ul><li>campaign = bianfang</li></ul> | [By the Throat](#R62_by_the_throat)<br /> |

With it now under our control we must make efforts to expand the fortifications and cement our control over the area to ensure that we cannot be flanked and have our logistics system cut off in any future wars in the region.\n\nHubao possesses greater significance than being a strategic fort. We have learned that it is one of the last vestiges of Harimar the Great's conquests in Yanshen. This remnant of great conquest serves as a reminder of the prowess that any Great Marshal must aspire to surpass. * | <li>Province 4901 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>If upper yanshen region does not have country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = command_hostile_lands_logistics</li><li>duration = 1825</li></ul></ul> |  |

In fact, our agents’ reports indicate that they have grown complacent in recent years. Occupying the two fortresses of Pordhatti and Tiltaghar -- which, between them, guard the rest of Rahen -- will shatter the so-called unity of the harimari, especially if this is done simultaneously.* | <li>controls is at least 4506</li><li>controls  is at least 4466</li> | <li>If has any known country has reform is raja reform:</li><ul><li>If random country has reform is raja reform:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = R62_lower_raj_cohesion_tt</li><li>the event [The Command Encroaches on the Harimraj](../events/the_command_encroaches_on_the_harimraj.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 10</li></ul> |  |

It is from here that the trumpeting elephants of our enemies originate. Sovereignty in this region is split between a number of squabbling “elephant-lords”, making it especially vulnerable.\n\nGiven recent acquisitions, we should strike while the iron is hot and obliterate the Ghavaanaji and their elephant herds before those vast creatures grow even larger.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>primary culture is ghavaanaj</li><li>war with is this nation</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is banjisbid_area</li><li>area  is banjiraal_area</li><li>area   is buhaanjirgal_area</li><li>area    is maldeelakhan_area</li><li>area     is pordhatti_area</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [The War Room](#R62_the_war_room)<br /> |

As our campaign approaches its climax, we have begun to place the elephant hordes under tighter and tighter control. The native Ghavaanaji may think themselves masters of these beasts, but many of them have been trampled as well.\n\nIt is clear that the elephants are a danger to all thinking creatures, and their movement must be tightly curtailed if we are to prosper. Moreover, keeping the elephants under strict guard shall serve as propaganda to show that we have truly tamed Ghavaanaj.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is banjisbid_area</li><li>area  is banjiraal_area</li><li>area   is buhaanjirgal_area</li><li>area    is maldeelakhan_area</li><li>area     is pordhatti_area</li></ul></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [Gunning for Ghavaanaj](#R62_start_the_ghavaanaj_campaign)<br /> |

The Grand Marshal has made clear to us that we must not be complacent, however; one wrong step, and a revolt could break out, led by the sullen elephant-riders whom we have conquered.\n\nAs such, we shall begin conditioning the elephants in these lands to accept us as riders. Who knows? One day, it may well be that we shall see a hobgoblin sitting atop an elephant, riding down his foes as our new Ghavaanaji subjects once did.* | <li>Province 4485 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li><li>owns or subject of  4506</li><li>owns or subject of   4466</li><li>owns or subject of    4488</li> | <li>command complete campaign effect:</li><ul><li>campaign = ghavaanaj</li></ul> | [Don't Get Trampled!](#R62_dont_get_trampled)<br /> |

In six years, all of Dhujat had been occupied… all but one city. Now, as hundreds of artillery crews train their sights on Khiraspid’s walls, the Command is preparing to make an example of the Porcelain Gate - one that Rahen shall not soon forget.* | <li>4409:</li><ul><li>sieged by is this nation</li><li>artillery in province is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>4409:</li><ul><li>change siege = 5</li></ul> | [Start the Dhujat Campaign](#R62_start_the_dhujat_campaign)<br /> |

Moreover, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the region was politically divided, leaving the path to conquest wide open. Thus, in 1507, the Command invaded Pordhatti in its first thrust into Dhujat.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>dhujat region:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is dhujat_region</li></ul></ul> | <li>add legitimacy or monarch power:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [The War Room](#R62_the_war_room)<br /> |

The strategy that we’ve employed until just recently has been to mutilate or just simply execute shamans, ridding ourselves of their chaotic influence but also eliminating any possibility of using their power for ourselves.\n\nHowever, the Oni of Azjakuma have lately been supplying us with what they call “korashi”, a rare material with the ability to neutralize magic’s effects. Using chains of this korashi, we have been able to bind shamans and inhibit their powers, only allowing them to use their magic in the capacity of living weapons during battle. Unfortunately, as the Command expands, the amount of shamans within our territory increases rapidly, while the amount of korashi we control… does not. Thankfully, the Oni are willing to increase exports of korashi to us in exchange for protection. Such an arrangement should be formalized quickly, before there are more shamans in the Command than there is korashi.* | <li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>alliance with is Y01</li><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y01</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -50</li><li>command change korashi supply:</li><ul><li>increase = yes</li></ul> |  |

To control them more and more korashi links have had to be forged. Extensive surveying of the Demon Hills has proved that there is just not enough untreated korashi in the Demon Hills for the amount of shamans needing chains. The Oni report to us that a ginormous deposit of Teimarji, their term for Raw Korashi, exists to the south, between the Lands of Yanshen and the One Xia. It is imperative that this area is brought under our control, and that we construct korahsi forges so that we can increase production. The supply of Korashi will never be a problem again.

He defeats and kills his rival, but when he tries to use his newfound power in war he kills not just the enemy but also his comrades.
