| <a name="khugdihr_secure_the_north">Secure the North</a><br />*Nestled between the lonely mountains and the Western Serpentspine lies the Dwaroval, and then the Northern Pass. To protect our economic interests in the area we should divert our resources from the dwarven caverns and tunnels to the pass so that no one else can take it from us, especially not the gray orcs of Frozenmaw.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is northern_pass_region</li><li>value is at least 7</li></ul><li>dwaroval area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [khug_manifest_destiny_flag](../flags/khug_manifest_destiny_flag.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = khug_tooltip_manifest_destiny</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>northern pass region:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Asra Bank](#khugdihr_the_asra_bank)<br /> |
| <a name="khugdihr_balgar_venerated_ancestor">Balgar, our Ancestor</a><br />*Khugdihr was once home to the stone dwarf Balgar the Builder, who devised the legendary white walls of Castanor and who built the Dragonforge in the City of Stone. We should stand up to our ancestors and revoke his exile so that he can return to Khugdihr and lay the groundwork our nation needs.* | <li>religion is regent_court</li><li>has personal deity balgar</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>value is at least 5</li></ul><li>2863:</li><ul><li>base tax is at least 15</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>the event [Revocation of the Exile](../events/revocation_of_the_exile.md) happens</li><li>add legitimacy = 25</li><li>add republican tradition = 10</li> |  |
| <a name="khugdihr_alliance_of_faith">Alliance of Faith</a><br />*Balgar the Builder. His name holds both historic and religious weight in Cannor and the Dwarovar. A legendary architect and engineer, his techniques are taught by our ancestor-venerating kin of the Serpentspine despite his exile from our hold, Khugdihr, and the Balgarsmiths of the Regent Court style him in the mantle of a god. It is through this two-fold worship that we might be able to reconcile our religious differences with our estranged brethren.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>religion is ancestor_worship</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is khugdihr_opinion_improved_100_tt</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is improved_relation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [ancestral_worshippers_unlocked](../flags/ancestral_worshippers_unlocked.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = khug_tooltip_unlock_ancestral_worshippers</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>loyalty = -20</li></ul> | [Balgar, our Ancestor](#khugdihr_balgar_venerated_ancestor)<br /> |
| <a name="khugdihr_the_ancestral_holds">The Ancestral Holds</a><br />*In the days of yore, before the last days of Aul Dwarov, the seat of power was Amldihr, the mighty hold of the High King. Beyond the Serpentsvale lay Er-Natvir, the heart of commerce in the ancient dwarven empire. These two holds have long cemented dwarven rule into the Serpentspine, but since the fall they are but shadows of their former selves. If they are to be restored to their former glory we must invite those who know of our ancestral ways into these holds.* | <li>4119:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier partially_ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier damaged_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier infested_hold</li></ul></ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier partially_ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier damaged_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier infested_hold</li></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_church_khug_ancestral_worshippers</li> | <li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>loyalty = -20</li></ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>change religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = khug_ancestral_holy_site</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4119:</li><ul><li>change religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = khug_ancestral_holy_site</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Alliance of Faith](#khugdihr_alliance_of_faith)<br />[Follow the Dagrite Road](#khugdihr_follow_the_dwarven_rail_road)<br /> |

| <a name="khugdihr_the_asra_bank">The Asra Bank</a><br />*Fognir Asra has become a legendary name among the cartels and merchant guilds of Cannor. He is the founder of the renowned (and influential) Asra Bank, a continent-spanning corporation. It is also he who funded multiple adventurers going into the Serpentspine - the Dwarovar - the ancestral home of all dwarves. Since these expeditions have been funded, we have settled into one of the holds, Khugdihr, and made it our home. It is now time to report back to him since this is the closest he and his clan have to their ancestral home, the hold of Ovdal Asra.* | <li>2863:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier partially_ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier damaged_hold</li></ul></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 7</li><li>region is west_dwarovar_region</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Asra Bank](../events/the_asra_bank.md) happens</li><li>add prestige = 10</li> |  |
| <a name="khugdihr_funding_the_reconquest">Funding the Reconquest</a><br />*To retake the Serpentspine in the name of Aul Dwarov has been a dream of our people for centuries, but never was it closer to reality than now. With the possibility of a restored dwarven Serpentspine on the horizon, we must divert resources from the Banks and Cartels to this reclamation effort, so that our reconquest will be successful.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier khug_reclamation_effort for 25 years</li><li>If dwarovrod 1 3 area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dwarovrod 4 6 area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dwarovrod 7 9 area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dwarovrod 10 12 area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Asra Bank](#khugdihr_the_asra_bank)<br /> |
| <a name="khugdihr_follow_the_dwarven_rail_road">Follow the Dagrite Road</a><br />*If Er-Natvir was the heart of Aul-Dwarov, then the Dagrite Roads are the veins. They span the entire Serpentspine and along them we must follow to see the riches that lie in wait, from the halls of Haraz Orldhûm, along the mithril forges of Mithradhûm to the Kingsrock and the Railyard: They will be part of Khugdihr.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is dwarovrod_1_3_area</li><li>area  is dwarovrod_4_6_area</li><li>area   is dwarovrod_7_9_area</li><li>area    is dwarovrod_10_12_area</li></ul><li>value is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>2931:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4119:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>2868:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4236:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add prestige = 20</li> | [Funding the Reconquest](#khugdihr_funding_the_reconquest)<br /> |
| <a name="khugdihr_industrial_dwarovar">Industrial Dwarovar</a><br />*It lies in the nature of dwarvenkind to forge, to shape, to build. But even our natural instinct can be incentivised. By further increasing production in our holds, we can make sure that the foundries of Haraz Orldhûm and Mithradhûm will not cease to supply our endeavours.* | <li>2868:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>trade goods is gold</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier partially_ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier damaged_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier infested_hold</li></ul></ul><li>4236:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>trade goods is gold</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier partially_ruined_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier damaged_hold</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has province modifier infested_hold</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier khug_dwarovar_industry for 25 years</li><li>2868:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>4236:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Follow the Dagrite Road](#khugdihr_follow_the_dwarven_rail_road)<br /> |

| <a name="khugdihr_anbenncoster_contacts">Anbenncóster Contacts</a><br />*When Fognir Asra founded the Asra Bank it was clear he would choose the City of World's Desire, Anbenncóst, as the place for the headquarters. The economic, political, and societal incentives were just too strong to ignore the possibility. But now his expedition has succeeded and Khugdihr has been reclaimed in his name. It seems prudent, then, that we should send a delegation to the bank, requesting personnel to further the bank's interest in the region.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 25</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier khug_exchange_of_personnel for 25 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every known country is part of hre:</li><ul><li>2863:</li><ul><li>discover country = PREV</li></ul></ul><li>8:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>set country flag [khug_helped](../flags/khug_helped.md)</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = khug_tooltip_eoa_discovers_you</li> | [The Asra Bank](#khugdihr_the_asra_bank)<br />[Foreign Investment](#khugdihr_foreign_investment)<br /> |
| <a name="khugdihr_investor_dividends_and_future_incentives">Investor Dividends</a><br />*With production well underway, a secure treasury, and a well-oiled bureaucracy, it is now time to give our sponsors - the Asra Bank first and foremost - a return on their investment. Along with their dividends, we will send them proof of our bookkeeping and some spare paper to boot.* | <li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>country gets the modifier khug_credible_state for 50 years</li><li>the event [Administrative Strain](../events/administrative_strain.md) happens</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = treasurer</li><li>name = "Magnus Asra"</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>culture = agate_dwarf</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>religion = regent_court</li></ul> | [Funding the Reconquest](#khugdihr_funding_the_reconquest)<br />[Anbenncóster Contacts](#khugdihr_anbenncoster_contacts)<br /> |
| <a name="khugdihr_allowing_bank_influence">Allowing Bank Influence</a><br />* One of the most important matters of our state is the constant flow of money. Luckily we are keeping good relations with our main sponsor, but a new idea has been proposed to our ruler: by offering the bank business incentives and special privileges in our state, in exchange for monetary investments, we could ensure that we will maintain a steady stream of outside funding. In the short term, this might not be the wisest decision, but we will weather it and emerge from the storm as a more successful state.* | <li>has dip advisor 3 yes</li><li>has adm advisor 3 yes</li><li>stability is at least 1</li><li>legitimacy equivalent is at least 100</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has estate estate_nobles</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has parliament</li></ul><li>current size of parliament is at least 15</li><li>has active debate</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 1000</li><li>If has estate is estate nobles:</li><ul><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty = -30</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier khug_bank_puppet_strong until otherwise removed</li><li>add legitimacy = -20</li><li>add republican tradition = -10</li><li>add corruption = 5</li><li>add stability = -1</li><li>2863:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = noble_rebels</li><li>size = 2</li></ul></ul> | [Investor Dividends](#khugdihr_investor_dividends_and_future_incentives)<br /> |
| <a name="khugdihr_nationalising_the_bank">Nationalising the Bank</a><br />* The Asra Bank has us in their clutches, and we are run more like a corporation than an actual nation-state. On the other hand, the bank is now run more like a state than a bank. To secure our financial stability we should reverse our relationship and nationalise the bank. This should also ensure that Clan Asra's interest in Khugdihr solidifies and that their personal attention rests primarily on us.

| <a name="khugdihr_successors_of_asra">Successors of Asra</a><br />*The legends speak of Ovdal Asra with veneration, a great hold like few others. Whether these are tall tales told by bards and their like, or whether there is some truth to them remains debatable, but one thing is certain: Asra was influential, to the point where it was represented by one of the dwarovkron's seven gems, and Khugdihr always had close ties to it as its sister-hold. But Ovdal Asra was found and promptly lost once again in 1410 after Fognir and his companions collapsed it to prevent an orcish invasion of Khugdihr, so Khugdihr is all that is left. Invested in us lies the history of our hold, the belief in a once-great empire, and the trust of the last of Clan Asra, Fognir. Are we not the successors of Asra then?* | <li>is not subject</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is khug_tooltip_owns_the_agate</li><li>has country modifier dwarovkron_agate</li></ul><li>crown land share is at least 50</li> | <li>the event [Successors of Asra](../events/successors_of_asra.md) happens</li> | [The Ancestral Holds](#khugdihr_the_ancestral_holds)<br />[Nationalising the Bank](#khugdihr_nationalising_the_bank)<br />[A Cannorian Hold](#khugdihr_a_cannorian_hold)<br /> |

| <a name="khugdihr_foreign_investment">Foreign Investment</a><br />*Khugdihr lies at the border between the Serpentspine and Cannor, and has had a monopoly on trade between the two continents ever since the Marrhold Connector, the only other way into the mountains, caved in. Because of this position, many foreigners are interested in us. These connections will give us an upper hand in most diplomatic forays, and, more importantly, will keep Cannor investing in us. The time has come to send out delegations to Cannor and secure aid.* | <li>diplomat is at least 1</li> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>western cannor superregion:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>escann superregion:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>dameshead sea region:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>If every known country has capital scope has superregion is escann superregion; and does not have culture group is orcish; and does not have culture group is goblin:</li><ul><li>2863:</li><ul><li>discover country = PREV</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = khug_tooltip_discover_cannor</li><li>2863:</li><ul><li>discover country = A38</li><li>discover country = A20</li><li>discover country = A73</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = khug_tooltip_escann_discovers_you</li><li>add dip power = 50</li> |  |

With our grip over Khugdihr established we can now reach out to our kin in Cannor, the dwarves of Rubyhold and Silverforge. Many dwarves there are eager to depart to the Serpentspine in search of glory, gold and... friendship? Whatever they want, if we can channel them through Khugdihr, we can speed up our own reclamation effort.* | <li>62:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>912:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>2863:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier khug_dwarven_aid for 50 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>62:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>set country flag [khug_helped](../flags/khug_helped.md)</li></ul></ul><li>912:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>set country flag [khug_helped](../flags/khug_helped.md)</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Foreign Investment](#khugdihr_foreign_investment)<br /> |

With gnomes in our capital we might just get the mechanical expertise we need – after all, was it not the gnomish tinkerer Mintbrick Puddlebonk who went into Ovdal Asra alongside Fognir Asra, and was it not him who managed to activate the golems to defeat the orcs?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>169:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>126:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>271:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 25</li> | <li>add dip power = -25</li><li>2863:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add gnomish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>169:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>set country flag [khug_helped](../flags/khug_helped.md)</li></ul></ul><li>126:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>set country flag [khug_helped](../flags/khug_helped.md)</li></ul></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every known country has capital scope has superregion is western cannor superregion:</li><ul><li>2863:</li><ul><li>discover country = PREV</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = khug_tooltip_cannor_discovers_you</li> | [Anbennarian Aid](#khugdihr_anbennarian_aid)<br /> |
