| <a name="WOOD_reclaim_the_emerald_path">Reclaim the Verdant Link</a><br />*If our people are to have any hope of pushing these invaders from the Deepwoods, we must ensure that the entirety of the Verdant Link lies within Wood Elven Hands. The vile Greenskins are using them to continue launching their incessant raids into the heart of our lands. We must seize them to end these raids and put them on the backfoot!* | <li>3049:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has country modifier deepwoods_verdant_pact</li></ul></ul><li>3050:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has country modifier deepwoods_verdant_pact</li></ul></ul><li>3053:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has country modifier deepwoods_verdant_pact</li></ul></ul><li>3059:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has country modifier deepwoods_verdant_pact</li></ul></ul><li>3063:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has country modifier deepwoods_verdant_pact</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier deepwoods_safe_wood for 30 years</li> |  |

| <a name="WOOD_own_the_emerald_path">Control the Verdant Link</a><br />*Even with the entirety of the Verdant Link lying within the Pact's hands, the raids continue when conflict flares up. Our allies' laxity in protecting the Links requires a change of policy. We must personally assume control of the Verdant Link, only then will the safety and security of our realm be ensured. This will have the added benefit of affording us a serious advantage over our compatriots once the Greenskins have been driven from our lands.* | <li>owns 3049</li><li>owns  3050</li><li>owns   3053</li><li>owns    3059</li><li>owns     3063</li> | <li>country gets the modifier deepwoods_safe_wood for 30 years</li> |  |

| <a name="WOOD_the_verdant_pact">The Verdant Pact</a><br />*The sudden onslaught of the Greenskins has caught our people completely unawares. In order to mount a proper defense of our lands, the various chiefs and petty kings formed the Verdant Pact to coordinate the war effort. We must deepen our ties with the various Wood Elven realms in an effort to forge a stronger united front, so that we might begin to mount an offensive against the vile orcs.* | <li>any ally:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>add splendor = 200</li><li>add dip power = 150</li> |  |
| <a name="WOOD_settle_the_refugees">Settle the Refugees</a><br />*When the Greentide first began, many of our people's realms were caught completely off-guard. Before they could even mount an effective resistance they were snuffed out. No matter what the old guard in the realm might grumble about now, we are Wood Elves first and foremost. Clan loyalties and old strife have no place in the face of this menace. To this effect, those few souls who survived the devastation wrought must be resettled so that we might benefit from their expertise in the trying times ahead.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>stability is at least 0</li> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>If has stability is 3:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = deepwoods_settled_refugee</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [The Verdant Pact](#WOOD_the_verdant_pact)<br /> |
| <a name="WOOD_invest_in_capital">Invest in the Capital</a><br />*As the scope of the conflict grows, we have taken in an ever increasing amount of refugees. Beyond this, the needs of state continue to grow. We must enlarge the capital while improving upon our existing facilities. This will ensure that the refugees and our own people don't lack for amenities while also furnishing us with much needed additional resources.* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>add adm power = -150</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Retaking our Land](#WOOD_retaking_our_land)<br />[Settle the Refugees](#WOOD_settle_the_refugees)<br /> |
| <a name="WOOD_prosperous_capital">Prosperous Capital</a><br />*Our investments have paid dividends, as the capital stands as a testament to the will and determination of the people. Even now new commerce flows into our city, and it is increasingly seen as a burgeoning centre of trade within the Deepwoods.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is prosperous_capital_tooltip</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul> | [Invest in the Capital](#WOOD_invest_in_capital)<br /> |

| <a name="WOOD_the_verdant_army">The Verdant Army</a><br />*The purpose of the Verdant Pact was to present a united front against the barbarous orcs. To this end, a common army of the Wood Elven realms was formed. This pooling of resources has had great effect, but we should contribute even more so that we might assume a leading role among the realms, thereby ensuring that we can influence the course of the war.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.5</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier deepwoods_verdant_army for 50 years</li> |  |
| <a name="WOOD_war_council">War Council</a><br />*Up until now, the disparate realms have pursued their own agendas in prosecuting the conflict despite the existence of the Verdant Army. If we are to truly rout the Greenskins from our homeland, we must adopt a unified vision. A war council composed of the leaders of the Verdant Pact must therefore be instituted, and naturally we will take a leading role in facilitating this.* | <li>prestige is at least 20</li><li>stability is at least 1</li> | <li>add army tradition = 15</li> | [The Verdant Army](#WOOD_the_verdant_army)<br /> |
| <a name="WOOD_retaking_our_land">Retaking our Land</a><br />*Even the most prepared of the realms saw integral parts of their territory seized during the height of the Greentide, ours included. We must reverse this travesty, and thus herald the beginning of an offensive to drive these interlopers from beneath the shadowed boughs of our homeland!* | <li>all core province:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If every core province has owned by is ROOT, and  has superregion is deepwoods superregion, and does not have culture is wood elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = fey_court</li><li>change culture = wood_elf</li><li>add devastation = 10</li></ul> | [War Council](#WOOD_war_council)<br /> |

| <a name="WOOD_end_of_the_green_menace">The End of the Green Menace</a><br />*At long last the Greenskins have been driven from our lands. Wood Elves across the Deepwoods rejoice for this is a momentous day for our people. For the first time in years peace might be able to prevail.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>stability is at least 3</li><li>religious unity is at least 1</li><li>prestige is at least 0</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>stability is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>country gets the modifier deepwoods_safe_wood until otherwise removed</li> | [Retaking our Land](#WOOD_retaking_our_land)<br /> |
| <a name="WOOD_unite_the_deepwoods">A United Forest</a><br />*It's finally time to claim our hegemony over the Deepwoods, and unite our fellow brethen under our banner.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>legitimacy is at least 95</li><li>stability is at least 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>stability is at least 1</li></ul><li>is not subject</li> | <li>If is controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add stability = 2</li></ul><li>If deepwoods superregion does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT; and does not have owner is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = unite_deepwoods_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every country has primary culture is wood elf, and  has capital scope has superregion is deepwoods superregion; and  is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>change culture = wood_elf</li></ul></ul></ul> | [The End of the Green Menace](#WOOD_end_of_the_green_menace)<br /> |

They are prepared to give their lives to defend their homes from these foul beasts.* | <li>is at war with religious enemy</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier deepwoods_fight_for_the_wood for 10 years</li> | [The Verdant Army](#WOOD_the_verdant_army)<br /> |

| <a name="WOOD_uniting_the_deepwood">Unite the Deepwoods</a><br />*With the end of the wars to drive out the Greenskins, many of our erstwhile allies within the Verdant Pact called for its dissolution and a return to the old ways. This shall not be case, for the old ways are what allowed for the travesty of the Greentide to occur to begin with. We must seize the opportunity and unite the Deepwoods, ensuring that such a harrowing event will never occur again.* | <li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>primary culture is wood_elf</li><li>war with is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier deepwoods_fight_for_the_wood for 10 years</li> | [At War with the Enemy](#WOOD_at_war_with_the_enemy)<br /> |

We shall harness whatever resources they might possess and divert them toward our own ends.* | <li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>primary culture is wood_elf</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier deepwoods_overlord for 50 years</li> | [Retaking our Land](#WOOD_retaking_our_land)<br /> |
