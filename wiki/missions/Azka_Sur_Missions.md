| <a name="U20_dwarves_friend_1">Our Dwarven Friends</a><br />*The friendship between the Citrine Dwarves and the Azka-Suri is proverbial and dates from the earliest days of Human settlement. As the hold looks to the emptied Dwarovar for expansion and us toward the rest of Bulwar we must reignite our bond!* | <li>H78:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = H78</li><li>value = 40</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="U20_dwarves_friend_2">Supporting the Reclamation</a><br />*The Citrine Dwarves were once part of Jaher’s great Phoenix Empire. Though it has been a very long time since those days, our people are still seen as a normalcy within their lands, a regular occurrence in their cities. Recently, they have been gathering resources to recolonize the lost holds of the Segbandal and some of our number wish to join them in this endeavour. Admittedly, the more of our people that live within Seghdihr the better for our position, but they can always gain from our help as well. We should send some of our experts into their hold to secure their supplies along with some soldiers. That ought to make our presence there more secure.* | <li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>H78:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has disaster remnant_stagnation_disaster</li></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -200</li><li>add manpower = -5</li><li>H78:</li><ul><li>the event [Volunteers from Azka-Sur](../events/volunteers_from_azka_sur.md) happens</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add human minority size effect = yes</li><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul></ul> | [Our Dwarven Friends](#U20_dwarves_friend_1)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_dwarves_friend_3">Free Trade in Seghdihr</a><br />*The reclamation of the Middle Dwarovar has led to an influx of wealth in Seghdihr and the volume of trade moving between the hold and our cities on the Suran has never been greater. We must set up new markets and fund some merchants to begin trading in earnest. Hopefully this will lead both countries to far greater wealth.* | <li>4124:</li><ul><li>has merchant this nation</li></ul><li>643:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4124:</li><ul><li>owned by is Seghdihr</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = -3</li><li>643:</li><ul><li>If has province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base tax = 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>4124:</li><ul><li>If has province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base tax = 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Supporting the Reclamation](#U20_dwarves_friend_2)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_dwarves_friend_4">The Sun Diadem</a><br />*The Citrine Dwarves have always been great artisans and their gems have adorned the rulers of Bulwar since the era of the God-Kings. But with our friendship so solidified and since the Dwarves have expanded into so many riches deeper in the Dwarovar thanks to our help, they have commissioned their greatest artisans to make a diadem for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] as an enduring sign of the friendship and unity between our two peoples.* | <li>643:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 40</li></ul><li>4124:</li><ul><li>owned by is Seghdihr</li><li>development is at least 70</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>2914:</li><ul><li>Is held by Seghdihr or its subjects</li></ul><li>4078:</li><ul><li>Is held by Seghdihr or its subjects</li></ul></ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Seghdihr</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Sun Diadem](../events/the_sun_diadem.md) happens</li> | [Free Trade in Seghdihr](#U20_dwarves_friend_3)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_coffee_mission_1">Sun Roasted Coffee</a><br />*According to many scholars, the word coffee comes from the city of Kufu near Eduz-Vacyn where the tradition of growing and brewing coffee is widely known in Bulwar. As our population and notably the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] consumes large quantities daily we aught to expand the plantations in Kufu. Soon we may even have enough to export!* | <li>634:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>634:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li></ul> | [Resettle the banks](#U20_resettle_plains)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_coffee_mission_2">The Barkazan Plant</a><br />*The southern coast of the Gulf of Rahen is known for its coffee. They often claim that the plant grew first in their mountains and was then brought elsewhere, a claim we, as Bulwari, have always dismissed. But nonetheless we need the coffee plantations of the Grixaak pack and their famous Barkazan coffee plant for our trade. We will be one step closer to creating the best coffee in the world!* | <li>gazraak region:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is coffee</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is empty</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has region is gazraak region, and  has trade goods is coffee:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 3</li></ul> | [Sun Roasted Coffee](#U20_coffee_mission_1)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_coffee_mission_3">Refining Our Variety</a><br />*As we control most of the old-world production of coffee, we have had scholars researching and testing various strains of the coffee plants we have available throughout our realm. They have striven to find the very best breed of this plant that will make the finest coffee in the world. Others are working to refine the coffee brewing process so that Azka-Sur will be known Halann over to have the finest cup of coffee in the world.* | <li>643:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "U20_best_coffee" until otherwise removed</li> | [The Barkazan Plant](#U20_coffee_mission_2)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_architecture">Surani Architecture</a><br />*Surani architecture has always been inspired by the various cultures that surround us. Originally it was the Citrine Dwarves, then the genies and elves and even the gnolls in some ways. As we expand across Bulwar we should have some consistency in our new buildings’ style so that our influence can be seen long after we are gone. This will also help to unite the people and make them more comfortable going from city to city. We will found a national school of architecture and establish which style we should follow.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is citrine_dwarf</li><li>type is artist</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is sun_elf</li><li>type is artist</li></ul><li>artist is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Many Styles of Azka-Sur](../events/the_many_styles_of_azka_sur.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="U20_royal_paradise">The Royal Paradise</a><br />*Sardazar has always been more quiet than the bustling streets of Azka-Sur and many [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s have favoured its countryside for their leisure activities. Our current ruler [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has taken a liking to the foothills of the Dwarovar that surround the city and has asked for the commission of a Paradise, an immense walled enclosure filled with forests and fields for his hunting sessions.* | <li>642:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>monthly mil is at least 8</li><li>mil is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Royal Hunt](../events/the_royal_hunt.md) happens</li><li>642:</li><ul><li>If has not has province modifier is surakes paradise garden:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = surakes_paradise_garden</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Surani Architecture](#U20_architecture)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_court_royal">A Royal Court</a><br />*As the paradise of Sardazar attracts visitors from all over Bulwar and has become the main residence of the Royal family what with all the hunting they do, many in the court have entertained the idea of expanding the hunting grounds to be part of a larger palatial district that would serve as the new capital of the realm, away from the priests of Azka-Sur. This physical separation of state and church will help further solidify the proper separation between the Chosen and the humans.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>642:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 400</li> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>set capital = 642</li><li>642:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul> | [The Royal Paradise](#U20_royal_paradise)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_audience_hall">An Audience Hall</a><br />*The palace district of Sardazar was a wonder by Bulwari standards, but the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] wanted something more. Soon, the idea of adding a wonderful audience chamber to echo the old Bulwari architecture of ages long past flourished in the minds of the royal architects. Adorned with sun motifs made of gems and gold and furnished with the finest timber from Bahar, it would symbolize the complete domination of the King of Kings over Bulwar and his authority as granted by Surael.* | <li>642:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is U20_audience_hall_tooltip</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is naval_supplies</li><li>base production is at least 15</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gems</li><li>base production is at least 15</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gold</li><li>base production is at least 15</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>642:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = U20_apadana_hall</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "U20_apadana_hall_dummy"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [A Royal Court](#U20_court_royal)<br /> |

| <a name="U20_fortress">Rebuilding 'Logrod-Tûngr'</a><br />*The fortress of Azka-Sur was first built long, long ago by the Citrine Dwarves of Seghdihr. At that time, it was a fortified market outpost, which allowed the local Surani to gather around a protected place and begin to civilize with the help of the dwarves. More recently, it has fallen into  disrepair and merchants do not wish to sell their wares in such an ancient and dilapidated place. With dwarven help we should be able to rebuild the fortress, and the market buildings in contains, without much cost. With it repaired, we will be able to defend against the dangers that await us out in the deserts.* | <li>treasury is at least 10</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction building</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -10</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_15th</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> | [Our Dwarven Friends](#U20_dwarves_friend_1)<br />[Building Legitimacy](#U20_building_legitimacy)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_return_surani">The Return of the Surani</a><br />*The lands beyond Azka-Sur were taken by Zokka’s pack following their conquest of Hašr, we only managed to successfully defend the land closest to our capital, and only barely.\nThough the gnolls took and ravaged the lands along the Suran, now that we have reconquered them, Surani refugees are pouring back in from other nearby realms and from secret hideout towns throughout the previously gnoll-occupied territory. The Suran is Surani once again!* | <li>jikarzax area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture group is bulwari</li><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>grixek area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture group is bulwari</li><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul> | <li>558:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>585:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>646:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>645:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>648:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Retaking the Outer Salahad](#U20_outer_salahad)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_resettle_plains">Resettle the banks</a><br />*The Upper Suran was never the richest part of Bulwar. Though the lands along the lower Suran and most of the Buranun tend to be highly populous and productive, ours, so close to the desert, tend to be less prolific. Not to mention the gnollish raids and conquests of late have left it in an even more pitiful state. Now that we control the region, we should invest in settling the upper Suran so that we can make the most of our wonderful namesake!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azka_sur_resettle_plains_tt</li><li>631:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>634:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>639:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>640:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>641:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>642:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>643:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U20_more_soldiers for 10 years</li> | [The Return of the Surani](#U20_return_surani)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_erlian_natu_fortress">Desert Fortresses</a><br />*The lands surrounding Azka-Sur must be defended or else there will be no buffer between our capital and the deserts. Some of the Erlian-Natu have brought us plans for a pair of fortresses in the borders to the desert. These two locations, to be manned by them, would act as a bulwark against the two closest entrances to the desert. This would allow us to defend the whole valley against threats.* | <li>645:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>558:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>645:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>change province name = "Nabilsu"</li></ul><li>558:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>change province name = "Zanagu"</li></ul> | [Resettle the banks](#U20_resettle_plains)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_erlian_natu_fortress_zokka">Honoring Erlian</a><br />*Erlian Surzuir was the last elven Akal of Azka-Sur and a hero to the Surani. His death while fighting against Zokka in 1444 is vividly remembered by all and as our control over the Harra Oasis has strengthened it seems logical to us to wipe out the memory of the monster by renaming her pitiful capital to Azka-Erlian. Praise Surael that we have pushed back the gnolls!* | <li>571:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>571:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>change province name = "Azka-Erlian"</li></ul> | [Desert Fortresses](#U20_erlian_natu_fortress)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_end_jadd">End the Jadd</a><br />*The Jaddari heresy has been exterminated in our lands but there are some among the elves and harpies in the east that still hold their twisted faith. We must ensure that they are not kept astray, whether through diplomacy or force. The Jadd must end.* | <li>far salahad region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is the_jadd</li></ul><li>is not city</li></ul></ul> | <li>If every country has primary culture is sun elf, and  has religion is bulwari sun cult, and  has capital scope has superregion is bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>the event [News from the Far Salahad](../events/news_from_the_far_salahad.md) happens</li></ul> | [Conquest of Ebbušubtu](#U20_conquest_mountain)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_carving_mountain">Carving the mountain</a><br />*The Mountain of Clear Sight is a magnificent place, surrounded on all sides by the open sun-soaked desert, one can see for miles around from the top. The Jaddari missionaries and priests had erected monasteries and fortresses on the mountain top that we have since put to use in spreading the true Cult to the people of the desert. As the last vestiges of the Jadd are finally gone, let us make a monument of this mountain. We shall carve an effigy of Jaher, he who is Surael reborn! Let his countenance gaze out upon the desert and let all who travel past look upon his face and know his Light. Praise Surael!* | <li>2909:</li><ul><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>culture is sun_elf</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>2909:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "U20_building_temple"</li><li>duration = 730</li></ul></ul><li>the event [The Face of Jaher](../events/the_face_of_jaher.md) happens</li> | [End the Jadd](#U20_end_jadd)<br />[The People of the Desert](#U20_people_desert)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_the_sad_sur">The Šad Sur Mountains</a><br />*Since we’ve pushed on to Sareyand, the gnolls of the Tluukt pack have been a major issue for our armies. From their position in the Šad Sur mountains they have been able to raid and harass our armies and supply lines without and real resistance. We must decide what to do about them.* | <li>688:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Tluukt</li></ul> | <li>the event [Dealing with the Gnolls of the Mountains](../events/dealing_with_the_gnolls_of_the_mountains.md) happens</li> | [Triumph of the Sur Zama](#U20_sur_zama)<br /> |
| <a name="U20_elves_eastern_bulwar">The Elves of Eastern Bulwar</a><br />*The Elves of Sareyand have been known to educating many deviants and decadents over the years. Tales from their manors along the Naza river have tarnished the good standing of the Cult in the eyes of many in Bulwar, saying that such acts are below those Chosen by Surael. It seems that they need to be reminded of their duties. The ancient fortress-city of Ekluzagnu in the Šad Sur mountains will be reorganized and rebuilt to house a great monastery for the Sun Elves. This will give them time and peace to remember why they were Chosen while they put themselves to work in their sacred duties.* | <li>owns 688</li><li>east naza area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>avamezan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>sareyand area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>688:</li><ul><li>change culture = sun_elf</li></ul><li>If every province has culture is sun elf, and has area is east naza area, and has area is avamezan area, and has area is sareyand area; and does not have province id is 625:</li><ul><li>change culture = zanite</li></ul> | [The Šad Sur Mountains](#U20_the_sad_sur)<br />[Bring Order to Sareyand](#U20_bringing_order_sareyand)<br /> |

They are mainly nomadic tribes but they follow the Light and so will be welcome among us. At least they are Human. Following the fall of Ebbušubtu, the so-called desert elves are floundering and the once disciplined legions of the Jaddari are scattered and broken. We have reached out to the leaders of the Mašnsih tribes and invited them to return to their ancestral lands under our protection and rule. Soon, the deserts will be human again and the desert elves will be no more than a story told to children.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azka_sur_masnsih_legion_tt</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any province:</li><ul><li>culture is desert_elf</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = U20_people_desert_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every province has culture is desert elf, and does not have province id is 2909:</li><ul><li>change culture = masnsih</li></ul><li>2909:</li><ul><li>change culture = sun_elf</li></ul></ul><li>add mil power = -100</li> | [Conquest of Ebbušubtu](#U20_conquest_mountain)<br /> |

Some allow them to advise and administer, but that has shown to lead to greed and stubbornness in the Chosen. It was believed here in Azka-Sur that the Chosen should be left only to do what Surael wishes for them, to lead the peoples of Bulwar in their faith in Surael’s Light and to help banish the Darkness from our hearts to let that Light in. With this in mind, the Peace of Surael states that all of the Chosen will henceforth be put into roles of a theocratic and magocratic nature.
