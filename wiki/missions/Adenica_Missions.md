| <a name="adenica_chivalric_justice">§lJustice§!</a><br />*A knight must be a champion of justice in all that they do.

| <a name="adenica_chivalric_temperance">§lTemperance§!</a><br />*A knight must be always in control. Of their surroundings, of their conduct toward others, and most of all, of themselves. Temperance extends not only toward drink, but all other forms of hedonistic excess that may tempt honourable followers of Adean.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>inflation is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0.1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>average unrest is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier adenica_temperance for 20 years</li><li>adenicaIncrementChivalryMissionCompleted = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set ruler flag [adenica_temperance_taken](../flags/adenica_temperance_taken.md)</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="adenica_western_approach">The Western Approach</a><br />*A relatively open patch of land between forests to its north and south, Silvervord provides easy access to Lake Silvermere as well as the lands of Inner Castanor. If we are to push our ambitions in Escann, this land must be controlled and patrolled by our knights.* | <li>silvervord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>upcreek area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If nortmerewood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If merescker area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Foal's First Steps](#adenica_foals_first_steps)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_royal_hunting_grounds">Royal Hunting Grounds</a><br />*Every self-respecting Kingdom needs a patch of forest to host great hunts in. The Nortmerewood and woods of Merescker should do nicely, while doubling as a path into the lands of Southern Castanor.* | <li>nortmerewood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>merescker area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If oudmerewood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If catelsvord area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If devaced area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Western Approach](#adenica_western_approach)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_stretch_legs">Back into the Open</a><br />*With the great forests bordering Lake Silvermere under our control, we can finally move into the plains and farmlands of the former Kingdom of Devaced. With our knights now able to roam and charge freely, we must push our advantage as far as we can.* | <li>oudmerewood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>catelsvord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>devaced area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If dostans way area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If vernham area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If oudeben area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Royal Hunting Grounds](#adenica_royal_hunting_grounds)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_secure_flanks">Secure our Flanks</a><br />*With Adean's blessing, we have expanded our nation further than it ever has before. Yet we must know our limits, and it is here, at the borders of the Deepwoods and the old Blademarcher kingdoms that we can see ours. We must now focus on integrating our current conquests and shoring up our borders to defend them.* | <li>dostans way area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>vernham area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>oudeben area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If cannwood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If westwall approach area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Back into the Open](#adenica_stretch_legs)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_gaze_north">Turn Gaze North</a><br />*Now that the southern border is secure, we can look toward the northeast and control of the all-important Alen River, which will function nicely as natural defense to our north. Westwall Approach can provide power over a direct stretch, while conquering Cannwood will allow us to patrol its banks further downstream.* | <li>cannwood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>westwall approach area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If nortmere area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lower nath area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If westgate area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure our Flanks](#adenica_secure_flanks)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_staging_grounds">Staging Grounds</a><br />*As our power and control over Escann grows, the unvoiced thought on many minds is the question of Castonath. As the capital of the once mighty Castanor and the largest city in all of Escann, it continues to hold great wealth and value to whomever controls it. To be able to take it, we first must penetrate the white walls of Inner Castanor and find ways around the natural defenses of Trialmount and the Nath River. Nortmere contains wide open fields that our knights can ride through as well as the old headquarters of the Sapphire Eye, and so is quite fitting as our next conquest.* | <li>nortmere area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>lower nath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>westgate area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If castonath area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier adenica_final_push for 10 years</li> | [Turn Gaze North](#adenica_gaze_north)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_reclaim_castonath">Jewel of the First Empire</a><br />*With the western approach into Castonath secured, all that remains is to take the city itself. Our knights stand ready to storm the city. All that remains is to send the order.* | <li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add splendor = 200</li> | [Staging Grounds](#adenica_staging_grounds)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_adeanic_escann_war">Thrust Through the Heart</a><br />*Escann has long been the Corinites' powerbase in Cannor. Generations of adventurers and their descendents call her their patron god, and rightfully so, as so many people will always be in her debt for what she accomplished against the Greentide. This does not give anyone the right to disregard Adean's rightful authority, however. We are uniquely positioned to be able to spear this heresy right through its young heart, and we will not fail. Let us show Escann the ultimate truth!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is adenica_adean_escann_tt</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is escanni</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is escann_superregion</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = adenica_adeanic_escann_war_effect_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set global flag [upgraded_adean_war](../flags/upgraded_adean_war.md)</li></ul><li>If every country has personal deity is adean:</li><ul><li>change personal deity = adean_adenica_war</li></ul> | [Adean's Favored](#adenica_adeans_favored_war)<br /> |

| <a name="adenica_chivalric_conviction">§lConviction§!</a><br />*A knight must be firm and true in his beliefs and actions, for a blade stayed by uncertainty will oft miss its mark. Conviction in the principles and ideals of Adean and one's own goals and actions is paramount for any knight to be successful.* | <li>religion is regent_court</li><li>num of religion:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>value is at least 0.8</li></ul><li>num of religion:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>value is at least 25</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = 75</li><li>add dip power = 75</li><li>add adm power = 75</li><li>adenicaIncrementChivalryMissionCompleted = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set ruler flag [adenica_conviction_taken](../flags/adenica_conviction_taken.md)</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="adenica_chivalric_wisdom">§lWisdom§!</a><br />*A knight must strive to keep the chivalric traditions alive, passing any lessons on to the next generation, especially as the old ways continue to falter in Cannor with the advent of new ideas and advancements in philosophy and technology. A knight must know how to blend new ideas in while keeping the spirits of the old chivalric traditions alive.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Rule Britannia"</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 175</li><li>adm power is at least 175</li><li>mil power is at least 175</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>innovativeness is at least 25</li></ul><li>university is at least 5</li></ul><li>num of generals is at least 4</li> | <li>country gets the modifier adenica_wisdom for 20 years</li><li>adenicaIncrementChivalryMissionCompleted = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set ruler flag [adenica_wisdom_taken](../flags/adenica_wisdom_taken.md)</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="adenica_noble_knights">Noble Knights</a><br />*In the days of the old Escanni kingdoms, many of the nobility also doubled as true, blooded knights, as duels and other honourable contests of single combat were the most common ways of pushing claims and settling disputes. Though it may take some initial concessions on our end, it will do our nation well to reinstate this type of relationship with our nobility, and push them again toward chivalric conduct.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Emperor"</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is noble_knights_trigger_tt</li><li>has estate privilege estate_nobles_officer_corp</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 45</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 35</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier adenica_nobility_is_knights for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="adenica_grand_hunt">A Grand Hunt</a><br />*With Nortmerewood under our control, we can now celebrate our conquests like how the knights did in the days of old. We should host a grand hunt in these pristine forests, left to grow wild after the Greentide wiped almost all human activity in them.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [adenica_hunt_event_unlocked](../flags/adenica_hunt_event_unlocked.md)</li></ul><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>the event [The Hunt: Which Beast?](../events/the_hunt_which_beast.md) happens</li> | [§lFrom Lowly Page§!](#adenica_from_lowly_page)<br />[Royal Hunting Grounds](#adenica_royal_hunting_grounds)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_shield_east_south">Lines of Defense</a><br />*All Escann was unprepared for the initial onslaught of the Greentide. Years of settling disputes primarily through duels and the Order of the Sapphire Eye left the land and people sorely unprepared, as forts and castles slowly lost their martial use, becoming more like residences than true fortifications for nobles. Though we revived the Adenican name primarily to evoke the past, we will not make the same mistakes that our predecessors made. We must heavily fortify our border from any possible incursion from both the south and the east. Let us block off Dostan's Way, ever under threat from Gnollish incursions, as well as Oudeben, with its open path to and from the east.* | <li>dostans way area:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>oudeben area:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier adenica_fortified_country for 20 years</li><li>custom tooltip = adenica_shield_east_south_effect_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has area is dostans way area, and  has fort level is 2, and  has manpower building trigger is yes, and  has force building trigger is yes, and  has owned by is ROOT, and  is core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = adenica_fortified_province</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If every owned province has area is oudeben area, and  has fort level is 2, and  has manpower building trigger is yes, and  has force building trigger is yes, and  has owned by is ROOT, and  is core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = adenica_fortified_province</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Secure our Flanks](#adenica_secure_flanks)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_demand_chivalric_oaths">Demand Chivalric Oaths</a><br />*With our monarch leading the way, much of our nobility has started following the Adeanic code of honour and chivalric principles. Whether in an effort to curry favour or out of a genuine belief is unclear, but at the very least we can be sure that our efforts are not for naught. It is time to formalize this, and encourage our nobility to take oaths of chivalry.* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Emperor"</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 75</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 60</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 55</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has government is monarchy:</li><ul><li>add government reform = adenica_chivalric_oaths</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier adenica_chivalric_oaths_temp for 20 years</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="adenica_build_tourney_grounds">A Proving Grounds</a><br />*The resurgence of our nation has also led to a corresponding rise in duels, tournaments, and other such chivalric contests. We should establish a Grand Tournament Grounds where the largest and most important of these can be held and spectated by all.* | <li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>769:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>num free building slots is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction building</li></ul></ul><li>cavalry fraction is at least 0.25</li> | <li>769:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = adenica_grand_tourney_grounds</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Grand Tourney Grounds: Foreign Challengers](../events/grand_tourney_grounds_foreign_challengers.md) happens</li></ul> | [Demand Chivalric Oaths](#adenica_demand_chivalric_oaths)<br /> |

Our duty will not be done, however, until all respect Adean's authority over the rest of the Regent Court. We must use all the tools at our disposal, even force, if necessary, to make the Corinites submit.

| <a name="adenica_adeans_favored_war">Adean's Favored</a><br />*To truly be able to lay claim and operate as Adean's will on Halann, we must build the greatest army that Cannor has ever seen. By assembling an army larger and more powerful than any other Regent Court country, we shall cement our legitimacy and authority in leading them against the heretic Corinites and Ravelians.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is adenica_adeans_favored_war_trigger_tt</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is this nation</li></ul><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>army size is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>has personal deity adean</li> | <li>country gets the modifier adenica_war_1 until otherwise removed</li> | [Adean's Righteous Spear](#adenica_righteous_spear)<br /> |
| <a name="adenica_glory_to_adean">Glory to Adean!</a><br />*It is time to take the battle to the heretics. The Corinite crusaders must be crushed where they stand, before they are able to spread their treasonous falsehoods even more among the commonfolk. And the Ravelians must be stopped before they can spread their mind-poison to the cities of Cannor, where those beliefs find purchase and take root among the intellectuals and artisans of society.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 75</li><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is adenica_glory_to_adean_tt</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is adenicaReligiousWarsWon</li><li>value is at least 20</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier adenica_war_2 until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = adenica_replace_modifier</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = adenica_war_1</li></ul> | [Adean's Favored](#adenica_adeans_favored_war)<br />[Reordering the Court](#adenica_reordering_court)<br /> |

| <a name="adenica_chivalric_duty">§lDuty§!</a><br />*A knight must value their duty above all. It is duty that binds the fabric of our society together, duty from the peasant and knight to their lord, and the lord's duty to in turn protect and organize his subjects. Changing times and circumstances may alter the nature of duty, but it must be adhered to nonetheless.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>government is monarchy</li></ul><li>months of ruling is at least 360</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>government is republic</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 6</li><li>mil is at least 6</li><li>dip is at least 6</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>government is theocracy</li></ul><li>months of ruling is at least 240</li></ul><li>legitimacy equivalent is at least 100</li><li>monarch is a general or an admiral</li> | <li>country gets the modifier adenica_duty for 20 years</li><li>adenicaIncrementChivalryMissionCompleted = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set ruler flag [adenica_duty_taken](../flags/adenica_duty_taken.md)</li></ul> |  |

They must not shirk from long and boring work, nor flee from the first sign of struggle. The land upon which every being depends on is a gift from the gods themselves, after all, and such gifts should not be squandered away due to laziness or contempt.* | <li>monthly income is at least 50</li><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 300</li><li>culture is adenner</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>If has monthly income is 50:</li><ul><li>add years of income = 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 500</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If has rohibon area has type is all, and rohibon area has owned by is root:</li><ul><li>rohibon area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 100</li></ul></ul><li>If has adenica area has type is all, and adenica area has owned by is root:</li><ul><li>adenica area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 100</li></ul></ul><li>If has taran plains area has type is all, and taran plains area has owned by is root:</li><ul><li>taran plains area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier adenica_diligence for 20 years</li><li>adenicaIncrementChivalryMissionCompleted = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set ruler flag [adenica_diligence_taken](../flags/adenica_diligence_taken.md)</li></ul> |  |

The original realm of Adenica, the birthplace of Adean and chivalry, is long lost to the Greentide, its noble knights dead or scattered to the winds. We are but mere pretenders to the title, at least for now.
