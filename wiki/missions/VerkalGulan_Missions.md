| <a name="verkalgulan_the_great_purge">The Great Purge</a><br />*The Citadel has been plagued by horrible corruption within and without. It's time we right this wrong in one fell swoop. We will bring every single case of misbehavior to court and banish them from our lands. This will upset the court and be a great disturbance, but we must burn out the Rot.* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add stability = -3</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add corruption = -10</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = noble_rebels</li><li>size = 1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="verkalgulan_the_hammer">The Hammer</a><br />*After decades of corruption [Root.Monarch.GetName] has finally managed to cleanse us from the Rot. For this feat and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] stern behavior [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] has received the cognomen 'The Hammer'.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_the_hammer</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul> | [The Great Purge](#verkalgulan_the_great_purge)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalgulan_open_mercenary_negotiations">Open Contract Negotiations</a><br />*With our growing wealth, and limited dwarf power, it seems that the logical choice for supplementing our military is mercenaries. However, mercenaries are still expensive, and it would be prudent to try and negotiate for a lower price.* | <li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is quartermaster</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 200</li> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_mercenary_negotiations for 15 years</li> | [For A Rainy Day](#verkalgulan_for_a_rainy_day)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_establish_mercenary_companies">Dedicated Companies</a><br />*With mercenaries used more and more they have taken up a prominent, if not equal, role in our military. But different mercenary bands often compete and even occasionally fall into conflict. Thus, in order to better organise our hired troops, we shall create dedicated mercenary companies within our armed forces and minimize such conflicts going forwards.* | <li>army organiser is at least 2</li><li>mil power is at least 300</li> | <li>add mil power = -300</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_the_golden_shield_company until otherwise removed</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_verkalgulan_the_golden_shield_company</li></ul><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_verkalgulan_the_citadel_cannonneers</li></ul><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_verkalgulan_the_kings_gate_banners</li></ul> | [Open Contract Negotiations](#verkalgulan_open_mercenary_negotiations)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_mercenary_integration">Mercenary Integration</a><br />*As our use of mercenary companies grows yet further, we should restructure our army so as to more efficiently manage our mercenary forces. This may come at the cost of our regular forces, but they are coming to fill more and more of a supplementary role anyway.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>army reformer is at least 4</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army reformer is at least 3</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 400</li> | <li>add mil power = -400</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_integrated_companies until otherwise removed</li> | [Dedicated Companies](#verkalgulan_establish_mercenary_companies)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_national_mercenaries">National Mercenaries</a><br />*The time has come! We shall disband our regular armed forces, and transition to a solely mercenary army!

| <a name="verkalgulan_ensure_company_discipline">Ensure Discipline</a><br />*Though our transition to a fully mercenary army has proven a wild success, we are still faced with the issue of discipline, as it is common knowledge that mercenaries would rather run than die. By paying different companies to turn on those running away, however, we can ensure that our companies police themselves!* | <li>army tradition is at least 80</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>commandant is at least 4</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>commandant is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_disciplined_mercenaries for 25 years</li> | [National Mercenaries](#verkalgulan_national_mercenaries)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalgulan_new_vault_magisters">New Vault Magisters</a><br />*Although the mines produce vast quantities of coin on a daily basis, an influx of coin always leads to one thing: inflation. If we are to avoid complete economic collapse, we must stem the flow of currency into the populace. To do so, the old, corrupt vault magisters must be replaced with those who are both capable and, most importantly, loyal.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = master_of_mint</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [The Great Purge](#verkalgulan_the_great_purge)<br />[The Citadel Delve](#verkalgulan_deepen_the_citadel_delve)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_for_a_rainy_day">For A Rainy Day</a><br />*In the future, our nation will face many challenges, whether they be orcish or goblin in nature, or something yet worse. As such, we must build up a reserve of wealth, for you can truly never be too careful, and you never know when a bit of coin could come in handy.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li></ul> | [New Vault Magisters](#verkalgulan_new_vault_magisters)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_master_of_the_treasury">Master of the Treasury</a><br />*If we are to manage our treasury properly, we must ensure that the dwarf in charge is up to the task. We must search out the greatest treasurer in the Dwarovar, for it will be no small task to keep our finances in check.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>master of mint is at least 4</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>master of mint is at least 3</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>treasurer is at least 4</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasurer is at least 3</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_well_managed_treasury for 25 years</li> | [For A Rainy Day](#verkalgulan_for_a_rainy_day)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_build_a_great_hoard">A Great Hoard</a><br />*It is said that after the Dragonwake many Dragons hoarded vast sums of wealth within their cavernous homes. Now, it seems, we do the same, as we extract wealth beyond one's wildest dreams on an almost daily basis. Let the Dragons watch in envy for no hoard rivals that of Verkal Gulan!* | <li>treasury is at least 10000</li> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li> | [Master of the Treasury](#verkalgulan_master_of_the_treasury)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_supply_the_worlds_vaults">The World's Vaults</a><br />*It is said that more gold lies within Verkal Gulan than the rest of all Halann combined, and this is no mere rumour. Gold reserves beyond any mortal’s wildest dreams lie within our walls, with yet more flowing in each day. Our hold is truly the richest in the world!* | <li>treasury is at least 100000</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_the_worlds_gold_supply until otherwise removed</li> | [A Great Hoard](#verkalgulan_build_a_great_hoard)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_the_world_bank">The World Bank</a><br />*What good is money if it sits in a vault? Though there are plenty of uses, it serves far better when loaned to others. After all, what’s better than money? Money that makes more money! Let it be known that the largest bank the world has yet seen is open for business!* | <li>treasury is at least 500000</li> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_the_world_bank until otherwise removed</li> | [The World's Vaults](#verkalgulan_supply_the_worlds_vaults)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_reclaim_hehodovar">Reclaim Hehodovar</a><br />*The ancient Hehodovar once served as a centre of architecture and construction for Aul-Dwarov, where Hehogrim the Diligent designed the first true holds, but it has long since fallen into ruin and disrepair, utterly infested with orcs and goblins. Serving also as a strategic location at the centre of the Segbandal alliance that once unified the Middle Dwarovar, it is vital that we bring this legendary hold under our control.* | <li>owns core province 4078</li><li>4078:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier infested_hold</li></ul></ul> | <li>4078:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_reclaimed_hold</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Secure the Tunnels](#verkalgulan_secure_the_tunnels)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_restore_hehodovar">Restore Hehodovar</a><br />*Once, Hehodovar was little more than a ruin. No more. Under our leadership, the Hold has been restored to its former glory once again! As they did millennia ago, builders and architects fill the streets of Hehodovar, discussing and preparing ever more elaborate architectural wonders.* | <li>owns core province 4078</li><li>4078:</li><ul><li>development is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>4078:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_rebuilt_hold</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Reclaim Hehodovar](#verkalgulan_reclaim_hehodovar)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalgulan_deepen_the_citadel_delve">The Citadel Delve</a><br />*Beneath Verkal Gulan lie vast veins of gold unlike any other in the Dwarovar. We must exploit this, and set up a sustainable gold-mining operation beneath our hold.* | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>trade goods is gold</li><li>base production is at least 18</li></ul> | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>add base production = -10</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_the_citadel_delve_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="verkalgulan_treasury_of_the_segbandal">Treasury of the Segbandal</a><br />*During the days of Aul-Dwarov, Verkal Gulan served as the mint of the entire empire, providing vast quantities of coinage to dwarves across the Dwarovar. And when Aul-Dwarov fell, we helped keep our brothers and sisters of the Segbandal afloat. If we continue to exploit the vast gold reserves we hold, we can claim the title of Treasury of the Segbandal once again!* | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>trade goods is gold</li><li>base production is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>add base production = -11</li><li>remove province modifier = verkalgulan_the_citadel_delve_1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_the_citadel_delve_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Citadel Delve](#verkalgulan_deepen_the_citadel_delve)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_eating_gold">Eating Gold</a><br />*It is said across Cannor and Bulwar that the dwarves of Verkal Gulan are so rich that they eat meals of gold off of gemstone plates. Although this may be a slight exaggeration, if we confirm our wealth to the world it will surely bring great notoriety, if not prestige, to our hold!* | <li>gold income is at least 50</li> | <li>add prestige = 50</li> | [Treasury of the Segbandal](#verkalgulan_treasury_of_the_segbandal)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_the_dragons_hunger">The Dragon's Hunger</a><br />*Each day, more gold is extracted from the depths. Every day, wealth beyond our wildest dreams flows before us.

| <a name="verkalgulan_build_the_rotunda_of_bells">The Rotunda of Bells</a><br />*With our increased funds, a prominent architect has come to us with a proposal: a grand new building, home to a massive dome, and equally massive bell, to serve as both a symbol of our wealth, and a centralised administrative hub.* | <li>owns core province 2914</li><li>treasury is at least 1000</li> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_the_rotunda_of_bells</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Invest in Public Works](#verkalgulan_invest_in_public_works)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_scout_the_tunnels">Scout the Tunnels</a><br />*For centuries we have remained in Verkal Gulan, waiting out the storm that was the vile orcs and conniving goblins. Now, however, with the Serpentspine seemingly emptied of a vast majority of their populations, we can finally step out into our ancient homeland, and begin the rebuilding process that has been long in the making.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier colonial_enthusiasm for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="verkalgulan_secure_the_tunnels">Secure the Tunnels</a><br />*If we are to ensure that our reclamation proceeds smoothly, we must dominate the tunnels that snake through the Serpentspine. If we can secure these supply routes, no other nation will be able to contest Verkal Gulan’s reunification of the Middle Dwarovar: the Segbandal!* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 12</li><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>4124:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4078:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4217:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4218:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Scout the Tunnels](#verkalgulan_scout_the_tunnels)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_take_seghdihr">Take Seghdihr</a><br />*Though Verkal Gulan has long served as a great entrance to the Segbandal, the primary entrance has always been Seghdihr. If we are to secure our region of the Serpentspine against outside threats, we must control all entrances to the region, which means conquering the ancient entrance for ourselves.* | <li>owns core province 4124</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add adm power = 100</li> | [Secure the Tunnels](#verkalgulan_secure_the_tunnels)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_reinforce_seghdihr">Reinforce Seghdihr</a><br />*Though Seghdihr is under our control, its defences are still woefully inadequate. We must further fortify the hold, and ensure that no invaders shall threaten our nation from Bulwar ever again!* | <li>owns core province 4124</li><li>4124:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>development is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>4124:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_gate_of_the_segbandal</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [Take Seghdihr](#verkalgulan_take_seghdihr)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_unify_the_segbandal">Unify the Segbandal</a><br />*Finally, after decades of effort, the Segbandal has been unified by Verkal Gulan! In every hold of our lands Dwarves live in safety, knowing that no invaders will ever threaten their home again. With these lands unified Verkal Gulan moves from one great project to another and stands ready to unite Aul-Dwarov once more!* | <li>middle dwarovar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li> | [Reinforce Seghdihr](#verkalgulan_reinforce_seghdihr)<br />[Restore Gor Ozumbrog](#verkalgulan_restore_gor_ozumbrog)<br />[Restore Hehodovar](#verkalgulan_restore_hehodovar)<br />[Strengthen Gor Vazumbrog](#verkalgulan_strengthen_gor_vazumbrog)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalgulan_start_digging">Start Digging</a><br />*Already, Verkal Gulan is home to vast gold reserves, however, what we have tapped into seems to be only the tip of the iceberg! We must dig deeper, in order to access the riches that lie further within the mountains.* | <li>capital is at least 2914</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 2 yes</li></ul> | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_finding_the_vein</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="verkalgulan_expand_the_citadel">Expand the Citadel</a><br />*To ensure our further prosperity, we must build up the infrastructure of Verkal Gulan. By placing investments across our hold, and expanding it further into the earth, we will secure our economy for future endeavors.* | <li>capital is at least 2914</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 4 yes</li></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = growth_of_capital</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Start Digging](#verkalgulan_start_digging)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_invest_in_public_works">Invest in Public Works</a><br />*Despite what some particularly fool-hardy (or innovative) alchemists would have you think, we cannot actually eat gold. Nor can we bathe in it, nor is it good for building public halls or roads. Even as we prepare to further expand the Citadel Delve, we must not ignore these other pieces of infrastructure.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier verkalgulan_public_infrastructure_benefits for 15 years</li> | [Expand the Citadel](#verkalgulan_expand_the_citadel)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_a_glorious_hold">A Glorious Hold</a><br />*Through no small effort, we have built a Hold rivaled by few others in the Dwarovar, even those from the days of Aul-Dwarov. Verkal Gulan now stands as an example to the rest of dwarfkind of as to what a proper hold really looks like.* | <li>capital is at least 2914</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>development is at least 100</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If has dlc is "Cradle of Civilization":</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>name = "Dhûndar Korvûzad"</li><li>type = statesman</li><li>skill = 4</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>culture = gold_dwarf</li><li>religion = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>name = "Dhûndar Korvûzad"</li><li>type = statesman</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>culture = gold_dwarf</li><li>religion = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Invest in Public Works](#verkalgulan_invest_in_public_works)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_a_golden_crown">A Golden Crown</a><br />*Verkal Gulan stands as the mightiest and most opulent Hold in the Serpentspine, outshining all but the ancient Amldihr and Grônstunad. Those Holds’ glories are but memories today, however, whereas Verkal Gulan basks in its riches for all to see. Let us take pride, as the Golden Crown of the Dwarovar!* | <li>capital is at least 2914</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>development is at least 130</li></ul> | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_a_golden_crown</li><li>duration = 36500</li></ul></ul> | [A Glorious Hold](#verkalgulan_a_glorious_hold)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_explore_the_caves">Explore the Caves</a><br />*Though the ancient Aul-Dwarov did not bother with the harsh terrain of the caverns that dot the Serpentspine, that eventually proved to be their downfall, as they could not hold their rail on so many fronts. We shall not repeat their mistakes, and secure the caves for the greater security of our new nation.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 12</li><li>has terrain cavern</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul> | [Scout the Tunnels](#verkalgulan_scout_the_tunnels)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_reclaim_gor_ozumbrog">Reclaim Gor Ozumbrog</a><br />*There is a great shame for the Gold Dwarves when it comes to Gor Ozumbrog to the east. That hold was the easternmost hold of the Segbandal, and in our fury against their rightful departure from the alliance after we became mere puppets of Jexis, we, along with the rest of the Segbandal sacked the hold which would eventually allow the goblins to finish what we had started. It is time to right that wrong and reclaim Gor Ozumrbog and restore its twofold purpose: to secure the Middle Dwarovar against any invasion from the east, and to serve as a staging ground for any expeditions into the goblin caverns of the Tree of Stone. To do so, however, we must clear the goblins who currently infest it.* | <li>owns core province 4218</li><li>4218:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier infested_hold</li></ul></ul> | <li>4218:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_reclaimed_hold</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Secure the Tunnels](#verkalgulan_secure_the_tunnels)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalgulan_restore_gor_ozumbrog">Restore Gor Ozumbrog</a><br />*Long has Gor Ozumbrog laid in a state of disrepair, slowly crumbling away to the ravages of both time and orckind. Under our watch, however, the ancient fortress has been restored to its former glory, and beyond! Gor Ozumbrog now stands as a shining example of the feats of engineering and restoration that the people of Verkal Gulan are capable of.* | <li>owns core province 4218</li><li>4218:</li><ul><li>development is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>4218:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalgulan_rebuilt_hold</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Reclaim Gor Ozumbrog](#verkalgulan_reclaim_gor_ozumbrog)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalgulan_forward_fortifications">Forward Fortifications</a><br />*Though Verkal Gulan itself is protected by vast fortresses, a siege of the capital itself is still the last thing we want.
