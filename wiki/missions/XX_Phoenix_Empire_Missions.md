| <a name="phoenix_empire_the_great_waterway">The Great Waterway</a><br />*The city of Bulwar stands as a testament to the might of Surael, and thanks to the canals within it linking the Suran to the Buranun, was once the greatest center of commerce in the entire empire. Over the years, however, the canals have fallen into disrepair, and Bulwar’s prominence has slowly faded. This cannot remain! The waterways will be repaired, and Bulwar shall once more be the crown jewel of the empire of Surael.* | <li>601:</li><ul><li>has province modifier great_bulwari_watercourse</li></ul> | <li>601:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="phoenix_empire_the_golden_highway">The Golden Highway</a><br />*Slicing through the desert sands lies the greatest of the monuments to the might of Surael; the Golden Highway. Or at least, it did in days long past. Laid in the wake of Jaher in his eastward conquests, the highway has, like so many other monuments of the old empire, fallen into disrepair.\n\nIf we are to once more project power from Yanshen to the Divenhal, we must be able to transport goods and soldiers between west and east with speed and ease, as Jaher did in those days long past. As such, the Golden Highway must be repaired; it is the will of Surael.* | <li>golden highway bulwar proper:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway far bulwar:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway far salahad:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway rahen coast:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway dhujat:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway xianjie:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway upper yanshen:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway yanshen coast:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier phoenix_empire_restoration_of_the_golden_highway for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="phoenix_empire_secure_bahar">Secure Bahar</a><br />*Bahar, the gateway between Bulwar and Cannor, has always been fiercely independent. These delusions of notions are, of course, delusional. The light of Surael shall be brought to the westernmost lands of Bulwar, and from Bahar, the march westward, to the conquests of Jexis, can begin.* | <li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = phoenix_conquest_cb_20_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier phoenix_conquest_cb_mod for 20 years</li></ul><li>If businor region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ourdia region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If daravans folly region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dostanor region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = phoenix_empire_timer_1</li><li>value = 0</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="phoenix_empire_the_busilari_protectorate">The Busilari Protectorate</a><br />*Businor, the realm of lions, was the sight of our first liberation, as Jaher freed the realm from the Castanorian yoke, and in one of the greatest tragedies of our ancestors, due to our lack of enlightenment, we did not even attempt to spread to Businor the light of Surael.\n\nThese lands, dominated by the kingdoms of Busilar and Eborthíl, are now of vital strategic importance. In the south of the region, the Isle of Tef serves as the beating heart of the Divenhali trade, whilst in the north, Busilar, with its protection behind the mighty Khenak Range, serves as an ideal staging point for the invasion of mighty Anbennar.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is businor_region</li><li>value is at least 20</li></ul><li>408:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>365:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = phoenix_conquest_cb_20_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier phoenix_conquest_cb_mod for 20 years</li></ul><li>If the borders region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have mission completed is phoenix empire the busilari protectorate:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = phoenix_empire_if_completed_previous_mission_20_tt</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>add adm power = 100</li></ul><li>If does not have check variable has which is phoenix empire timer 1, and check variable has value is 240:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = phoenix_empire_timed_missions_completed</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>If has mission completed is phoenix empire secure bahar:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = phoenix_empire_months_since_completing_previous_mission_1_tt</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = phoenix_empire_timer_1</li><li>value = 0</li></ul></ul> | [Secure Bahar](#phoenix_empire_secure_bahar)<br /> |
| <a name="phoenix_empire_link_up">Link Up</a><br />*With the continuing of our conquests in Cannor, the fact is that should any power challenge our naval dominance of the Divenhal, the Busilari Protectorate could easily fall out of our grasp. As such, our conquests in the west must be connected, and the Empire of Anbennar, divided and disunited by their foolish conflicts over false gods, serves as a weak and easy target.\n\nFor their own good, the light of Surael shall be brought to the Borders. The liberation of Anbennar has begun.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is the_borders_region</li><li>value is at least 20</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>region is businor_region</li><li>is overseas</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = phoenix_conquest_cb_20_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier phoenix_conquest_cb_mod for 20 years</li></ul><li>If east dameshead region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If esmaria region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have mission completed is phoenix empire link up:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = phoenix_empire_if_completed_previous_mission_20_tt</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>If the borders region has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add unrest = -3</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>If businor region has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add unrest = -3</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>If dostanor region has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add unrest = -3</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have check variable has which is phoenix empire timer 1, and check variable has value is 240:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If the borders region has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add unrest = -3</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>If businor region has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add unrest = -3</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>If dostanor region has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add unrest = -3</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = phoenix_empire_timed_missions_completed</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>If has mission completed is phoenix empire the busilari protectorate:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = phoenix_empire_months_since_completing_previous_mission_1_tt</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = phoenix_empire_timer_1</li><li>value = 0</li></ul></ul> | [The Busilari Protectorate](#phoenix_empire_the_busilari_protectorate)<br />[The Corvurian Protectorate](#phoenix_empire_the_corvurian_protectorate)<br /> |
| <a name="phoenix_empire_jexis_conquest">Jexis' Conquest</a><br />*Hundreds of years ago, Jexis, daughter of Jaher, brought the light of Surael all the way to the isle of Damesear. We must recreate this conquest, for these lands have forsaken the light of Surael, in favour of their false Regent Court. The westerners’ petty dispute between their silly notions of these so-called gods of “Corin” and “Adean” shall be settled once and for all; there is no god but Surael.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is east_dameshead_region</li><li>region  is esmaria_region</li><li>region   is the_borders_region</li></ul><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = phoenix_conquest_cb_20_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier phoenix_conquest_cb_mod for 20 years</li></ul><li>If west dameshead region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If damescrown region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If forlorn vale region does not have owned by is ROOT, and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Victory in Anbenncóst](../events/victory_in_anbenncost.md) happens</li><li>If does not have mission completed is phoenix empire jexis conquest:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = phoenix_empire_if_completed_previous_mission_20_tt</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have check variable has which is phoenix empire timer 1, and check variable has value is 240:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = phoenix_empire_timed_missions_completed</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>If has mission completed is phoenix empire link up:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = phoenix_empire_months_since_completing_previous_mission_1_tt</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = phoenix_empire_timer_1</li><li>value = 0</li></ul></ul> | [Link Up](#phoenix_empire_link_up)<br /> |
| <a name="phoenix_empire_around_the_dameshead">Around the Dameshead</a><br />*The Dameshead, at the center of Cannor, serves as one of, if not the greatest centers of commerce in the known world. Through control of this mighty inland sea, and the riches of the merchant-cities that surround it, we shall secure for ourselves a near-endless source of income, for despite our faith in Surael, our legions do not march on faith alone.

| <a name="phoenix_empire_one_empire">One Empire</a><br />*Since its founding, the Empire of Anbennar has been weak and divided. With near-constant infighting and conflict, despite its vast riches, Anbennar has not once in its history been truly united. Until now, that is.

The riverlands readily provide some of the most fertile lands in all Halann, bringing lush greenery to what would have otherwise been yet more of the vast Salahad. Yet, as Surael’s empire grows, it cannot be helped but to notice that the supply of arable land is comparatively limited. Only so many new farms can be constructed before floodplains give way to the barren mountains and deserts which act as Bulwar’s shield. As such, what land is available shall be exploited, overturned, and made all the more efficient with modern irrigation techniques, foreign crops, and of course, the labour of the servants of Surael.

Following the dissolution of Jexis’ empire, many of them would serve as bases of power for the various kingdoms who went on to squabble over the Bulwari heartland.

So, therefore, it shares much similarity to Bulwar; a land of once prosperous kingdoms, assailed on all sides by enemies and conquerors.
