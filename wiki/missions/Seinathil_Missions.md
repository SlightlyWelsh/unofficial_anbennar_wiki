| <a name="seinathil_senior_branch">Make Amends with Istralore</a><br />*During the Lilac Wars, we fought on the side of the Rose Party against our cousins in Istralore. Tensions have been high since then, the word "traitor" thrown about with little care. These wounds will heal over time,  but healing them sooner than that could be helpful for us. After all, Istralore, despite being blood, is no doubt more powerful than us. We could pull some strings with friends like that...* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A45:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>A45:</li><ul><li>is rival is Seinathil</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add legitimacy = 10</li> |  |
| <a name="seinathil_istralores_stage">Usurping Istralore's Stage</a><br />*Long have we stood on the sidelines, the backing band to Istralore's fame. We have grovelled at their feet for a place at the table, and have gotten little for it. It is time to pull some strings. \n\nIt shouldn't be hard. Our songs continue to be played all through Anbennar, stories of our glory travelling wide, while Istralore has been backsliding since the Lilac Wars. It's time to decide who's the real 'cadet branch' of the family.* | <li>prestige is Istralore</li> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A45</li><li>type = cb_restore_personal_union</li><li>months = 240</li></ul> | [Make Amends with Istralore](#seinathil_senior_branch)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_conductor_ensemble">A Conductor, an Ensemble</a><br />*The claim has been made, there is no turning back now. Istralore's crown shall be our's, and with it we will take our rightful place on the global stage! We are not the lesser branch of the Silistra family, we have glory beyond what you know!* | <li>senior union with is Istralore</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>A45:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_reigning_in_the_marshals" for 50 years</li><li>create general:</li><ul><li>tradition = 75</li></ul> | [Usurping Istralore's Stage](#seinathil_istralores_stage)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_deamoine_madrigals">Deamóine Madrigals</a><br />*Deamóine is home to a noteable halfling population - they have their own culture, and musical styles, distinct from us, but are still focused on their traditional job of farming. They could be so much more! Madrigals are quite popular in Deamóine these days, if we were to develop the province a bit more, we could work towards exporting more than just fruits and vegetables, but more sheetmusic!* | <li>333:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = seinathil_deamoine_madrigals.tt</li><li>333:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul><li>set country flag [seinathil_paper1](../flags/seinathil_paper1.md)</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has trade goods is paper:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A90_sheet_music_1</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>hidden = yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Rebuild the Songbarges](#seinathil_rebuild_songbarges)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_esterfield_ballads">Esterfield Ballads</a><br />*Estallen is a land of love, of passion. Such topics are commonly the subject of songs, and Esterfield has many bards writing ballads to the fair maiden across the way. Perhaps with a bit of work, we could turn this into a lucrative business, exporting sheetmusic filled with love ballads across Anbennar?* | <li>279:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 25</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = seinathil_esterfield_ballads.tt</li><li>279:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul><li>set country flag [seinathil_paper2](../flags/seinathil_paper2.md)</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has trade goods is paper:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A90_sheet_music_2</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>hidden = yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Deamóine Madrigals](#seinathil_deamoine_madrigals)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_cardesti_neighborhoods">Cardesti Neighborhoods</a><br />*The Cardesti are a people with a cursed and unfortunate history. There are many throughout Anbennar who would turn them away for fear of the curse, but we see a small kinship in these people's culture.\n\nThey, like us, have a strong passion for the musical arts, and their grand festivals and carnivals would fit right at home in our cities! We should invite these people to settle in our lands, permanently!* | <li>songbarges area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_cardesti_haven" for 100 years</li> | [Esterfield Ballads](#seinathil_esterfield_ballads)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_freedom_triumph">Freedom and Triumph</a><br />*What inspires a musical epic more than tales of good VS evil? Truly nothing. The legends of battles against Witch-Kings continue to touch the lips of bards to this very day, but it has been quite some time since Alarian Singkeep liberated our capital from Black Castanor. If we were to defeat a new evil, we could surely have new material to last us for years!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is seinathil_freedom_triumph_tt</li><li>has country flag [A90_fought_evil](../flags/a90_fought_evil.md)</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_songs_freedom_triumph" for 25 years</li> | [Form the Seincourt](#seinathil_seincourt)<br /> |

| <a name="seinathil_rally_forces">Rally Our Forces</a><br />*The region known as the Songbarges stretches from Esterfield to Deamóine, but we only control a small portion of this land. Truly, it is the 'song' barges, yes? Who better to rule this land than the true masters of song itself? We must work towards righting this wrong, by force.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 1.0</li> | <li>songbarges area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="seinathil_singing_songbarges">A Singing Songbarges</a><br />*The wars will be long and bloody, but the material our bards will get for songs of our victory will be song far and wide through the Songbarges, and beyond! They will know that this day Seinathíl reigns surpreme!* | <li>songbarges area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_singing_songbarges" for 10 years</li> | [Rally Our Forces](#seinathil_rally_forces)<br />[A Fledgling Fugue](#seinathil_fledgling_fugue)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_rebuild_songbarges">Rebuild the Songbarges</a><br />*The wars were, indeed, long and bloody, and while we have a lot of new material for our songs and poems, our citizens are suffering. Seinathíl isn't a land of tyrants, these new citizens will learn that we are here to lift them up! We should spend some time rebuilding, repairing this land we just conquered. Soon it will be even better than before, and the epics they write about our rule will be so many that they may even need to open new paper factories to keep up with the sheetmusic demand!* | <li>songbarges area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>274:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "A90_rebuild_songbridges" for 25 years</li> | [A Singing Songbarges](#seinathil_singing_songbarges)<br />[A Swelling Seranade](#seinathil_swelling_seranade)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_bardic_college">Renovate the Bardic College</a><br />*The Seinathíl Bardic College was founded hundreds of years ago, following the War of the Sorcerer-King. While it is still the best college in the world for learning of the Bardic arts, we would be lying if we said it couldn't use a little touching up. With some renovations, it will become not only as impressive as its hayday, but even better!* | <li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>artist is at least 2</li> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>916:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "A90_bardic_college_1"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = university</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> | [Rebuild the Songbarges](#seinathil_rebuild_songbarges)<br />[A Mighty Minuet](#seinathil_mighty_minuet)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_reinstate_warsingers">Reinstate the Warsingers</a><br />*When the Silistra family moved here in the 1300s they brought the Istralari Banshee to these lands. These Banshee soon morphed into an elite squad of warriors, famous for their music art called 'warsinging', and named for the founder of the Silistra dynasty, Istralania Warsinger. In the years since, the Warsingers have become little more than a footnote in history, but if we open a new wing in the Bardic College, specifically for the purpose of training new warriors in the art of Warsinging, we could have a ressurgeance on our hands!* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has building university</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_seinathil_warsingers</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Renovate the Bardic College](#seinathil_bardic_college)<br />[A Climactic Concerto](#seinathil_climactic_concerto)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_imperial_ambitions">Imperial Ambitions</a><br />*For what purpose are we an Empire? Anbennar was founded hundreds of years ago, and for what? It was meant to cease the squabbling of petty warlords, keen on little more than ruffling their feathers and declaring themselves petty kings.\n\nAnd yet here we are, in the present, with Emperors doing little more than working to further their own goals, be it Dameria or Wex, the effect is the same.\n\nNo longer. We will throw our hat into the ring. Seinathíl is forcing its way onto the center stage. We are not a collection of states to be trampled on by a powerful Emperor, the Emperor is here to lead, to protect! And that is what we shall do.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>desc is gen_hre_electors.tooltip</li><li>all elector:</li><ul><li>preferred emperor is this nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_imperial_ambitions" for 25 years</li> | [Form the Seincourt](#seinathil_seincourt)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_songemperor">The Songemperor</a><br />*The weight of the crown is heavy. Songs have been sung for countless centuries on how absolute power corrupts, but we must stay true to our goals. The Anbennari dream is one of countless states working together. They will sing songs of our coronation, but they will not match even a percentage of the songs they will sing of what we will do with that crown.* | <li>is the emperor</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_songemperor" for 25 years</li> | [Imperial Ambitions](#seinathil_imperial_ambitions)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_united_anbennar">A United Anbennar</a><br />*Times have been troubled. News from across the seas shaking the very foundations of what we knew to be true. And yet, we have weathered it. Anbennar is united once again, for one common goal. And we shall reach it.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>is part of hre</li><li>has matching religion this nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_united_anbennar" until otherwise removed</li> | [The Songemperor](#seinathil_songemperor)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_anbennar_dream">The Anbennar Dream</a><br />*The Empire of Anbennar was designed for a very specific purpose. After the fall of the Jexisian Empire the region was a mess, with squabbling warlords fighting over whatever scraps they could find. The Grand Summit of Aranthíl changed all that, and the Empire was formed to move our lands together in peace. We are seperate, but also we work together for a better life. That's what the Anbennar Dream is. We should spread this dream far and wide.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>is part of hre</li></ul><li>amount is at least 70</li></ul><li>hre reform passed is emperor_reichstag_collegia</li> | <li>the event [The Anbennar Dream!](../events/the_anbennar_dream.md) happens</li> | [A United Anbennar](#seinathil_united_anbennar)<br /> |

| <a name="seinathil_fledgling_fugue">A Fledgling Fugue</a><br />*Our true journey starts here. Seinathíl is in a dangerous position, sandwiched between those who would see us brought to harm, but we will weather it, and by the end, they will be singing undending tales of our brilliance, so enticing that many will be entranced, wishing to immigrate to our lands so they, too, may get just a grasp of that limelight.* | <li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>prestige is at least 50</li> | <li>add prestige = -30</li><li>add legitimacy = -30</li><li>A90:</li><ul><li>the event [Migrants Flock to our Cities](../events/migrants_flock_to_our_cities.md) happens</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="seinathil_mighty_minuet">A Mighty Minuet</a><br />*As our legends grow, so too do our forces. A soldier looking to stake his claim and make his fortune realizes that Seinathíl is a name to respected, a brand of quality. And with him, we shall continue our legacy.* | <li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>prestige is at least 80</li> | <li>add prestige = -30</li><li>add legitimacy = -30</li><li>country gets the modifier "A90_mighty_minuet" for 15 years</li> | [A Swelling Seranade](#seinathil_swelling_seranade)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_climactic_concerto">A Climactic Concerto</a><br />*Music, for the most part, has been one of two things for the majority of history. A court musician would play a fancy show for the royal court, or a traveling bard would play for a few peasants in a bar. Today, we will invent a third way to experience music: the music festival! This giant event will be held every five years, and be a testament to the glory of Seinathíl's musicians! Thousands will come from miles around to witness the day's music.* | <li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>prestige is at least 90</li> | <li>add prestige = -30</li><li>add legitimacy = -30</li><li>A90:</li><ul><li>the event [This Year's Notestock!](../events/this_year_s_notestock.md) happens</li></ul> | [A Mighty Minuet](#seinathil_mighty_minuet)<br /> |
| <a name="seinathil_seincourt">Form the Seincourt</a><br />*Our nation and the Bardic college, and its arts, have gotten further and further entwined. Bards and musicians are in the highest ranks of office, and the time has come to make our bardic supremacy official. With a simple decree, we will become the Seincourt, a government build around music and the stories produced from such.\n\nThe Bardic College will be uplifted as the organizer of all magic in the realm, and we will be able to focus on what we truly wish to, the spread of our songs and stories.\n\n§RWARNING: THIS WILL LOWER YOUR GOVERNING CAPACITY BY HALF.

| <a name="seinathil_fight_muse">Fight for our Muses</a><br />*The bards of Seinathíl have historically sung to the gods of the Regent Court, using them as their many muses. But two muses in particular have taken particular prominence: first, there's Ryala, who has consistantly been the voice to whom we sing for centuries. Then you have the more recently ascended Munas, the god of music.\n\nToday, those muses are in danger. Corin and her ilk are fighting to disrupt the court, and if we don't protect our muses, who will we sing to now?* | <li>hre has leagues enabled</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>is league leader</li></ul><li>in league is regent_court</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_for_regent_court" for 25 years</li> | [Imperial Ambitions](#seinathil_imperial_ambitions)<br /> |

We have the court itself to thank for this victory, and our muses especially. But which specifically helped us here, in our time of need?* | <li>hre religion is regent_court</li><li>religion is regent_court</li> | <li>custom tooltip = seinathil_choose_muse.tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Who Should We Sing Songs To?](../events/who_should_we_sing_songs_to.md) happens</li></ul> | [Fight for our Muses](#seinathil_fight_muse)<br /> |

| <a name="seinathil_new_allies">New Allies</a><br />*We are in a precarious situation. After the Lilac Wars, old alliances broke down, and we are alone and vulnerable here, threatened on all sides. We need to find a new friend here, one who will stand by us in our time of need.* | <li>num of allies is at least 1</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A90_friendship" for 10 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = seinathilBardicAlliesWarWon</li><li>value = 0</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="seinathil_bard_support">Bards are a Support Class</a><br />*Bards are not warriors. On the field of battle, you might assume one to be useless. However, that is simply not true. While a Bard might struggle alone, what they can do in support of others is where their real talents lie. We are like the noble bard, in many ways.\n\nAlone, we can't make it. But with our new friends, we can. Our bards will sing songs of our friendship, and together we will take to the battlefields, stronger than if we were apart.* | <li>any ally:</li><ul><li>trust:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 80</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = seinathil_bard_support.tt</li><li>If random ally has trust has who is ROOT, and trust has value is 80:</li><ul><li>set country flag [A90_bardic_ally](../flags/a90_bardic_ally.md)</li><li>add historical friend = A90</li><li>A90:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = PREV</li></ul></ul><li>set country flag [A90_bardic_mod1](../flags/a90_bardic_mod1.md)</li> | [A Fledgling Fugue](#seinathil_fledgling_fugue)<br />[New Allies](#seinathil_new_allies)<br /> |

It is certainly impressive, yes, but as time progresses and new advances are made, it has a tendency to stick to more conservative methods.\n\nLet's revolutionize our college with a full rehaul and renovation! All the best and brightest minds, all the rarest books on the subjects of Enchantment. With this by our side, we should find it easier to research magic ourselves, and with such a glorious school, it would be criminal NOT to send future heirs to school there!* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 70</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li> | <li>custom tooltip = seinathil_modernize_college_tt</li><li>set country flag [A90_modern_college](../flags/a90_modern_college.md)</li><li>add treasury = -1000</li> | [Strengthening the Bards](#seinathil_strengthening_bards)<br /> |

It has lost much of its luster and is little more than an artifact of a bygone era, broken and unusable. It is time to fix that.

These Gerudians have a long storied history of music and tales, sung by those they call Skalds. They are quite similar to our own bards! Perhaps there's more in common between us than you'd expect!

| <a name="seinathil_skaldic_teachings">Incorporate the Skalds</a><br />*With the modernization of the Bardic College, we should look for more classes and subjects to teach. Our old friends of the north, the Skalds, have taught us much just through casual conversation and our alliance, but if we invite them into the classroom in an official manner, our bards can learn directly from them!\n\nThis will have the unfortunate side effect of proably angering many of our homegrown Bards, however, who want to be the ones teaching classes, not some foreign northmen.* | <li>any ally:</li><ul><li>religion is skaldhyrric_faith</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = seinathil_skaldic_teachings.tt</li><li>set country flag [seinathil_skaldic_teachings](../flags/seinathil_skaldic_teachings.md)</li> | [Modernize the Bardic College](#seinathil_modernize_college)<br />[Our Skald Allies](#seinathil_skald_allies)<br /> |
