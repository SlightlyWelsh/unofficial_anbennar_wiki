| <a name="H91_on_the_road_again">On the Road Again</a><br />*We of the Roadwarriors have never been ones to play the part of the fool. Korgus’ invasion of the surface world however has presented us with a great opportunity to pillage the Serpentspine without the interference of a number of other clans who had joined him. Let us make the most of Korgus’ folly, and take to the roads once more.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>capital is at least 4029</li></ul><li>hidden trigger:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 100</li> |  |

| <a name="H91_stop_for_nothing">Stop for Nothing</a><br />*Pillaging waits for no one, and if we wait, we might very well lose out on valuable loot taken by other more enterprising individuals. That’s why we Roadwarriors should have a dedicated group of followers to move ahead of the main warband and ensure that the tunnels and caves are clear- that way we have less surprises ahead, and so we can ensure that there’s a clear path ahead.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is roadwarrior_purge_warband_tt</li><li>has country flag [purged_warband](../flags/purged_warband.md)</li></ul><li>hidden trigger:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = 100</li> |  |
| <a name="H91_in_and_out">In and Out</a><br />* Raiding and pillaging isn’t simple work. Despite what some might think, it’s more complicated than simply rushing at an enemy fortification. Sometimes you have to throw a bit of fire, or catch the place while some of the defenders are out on patrol. Regardless of circumstance, prioritizing what and what not to take is paramount in any pillaging spree. A gold candle is both easier to grab and carry off than a silver chair.* | <li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>2963:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is a capital</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>2963:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = roadwarrior_looting_hold</li><li>duration = 365</li></ul></ul> | [On the Road Again](#H91_on_the_road_again)<br />[Stop for Nothing](#H91_stop_for_nothing)<br />[Trinkets and Treasures](#H91_trinkets_and_treasures)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_greater_than_gold">Greater than Gold</a><br />*What's greater than gold? The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would have said nothing at all, but the boys seem to want to prove [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] wrong...* | <li>2963:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_looting_hold</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Making a Discovery](../events/making_a_discovery.md) happens</li><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li> | [In and Out](#H91_in_and_out)<br /> |

| <a name="H91_trinkets_and_treasures">Trinkets and Treasures</a><br />*Trophies, Treasures, Wealth- whatever one calls it, shiny and valuable things are useful, usually to get other Orcs to do things for you. We should have a suitable amount on hand at all times in order to ensure we can always get a few of the boys to jump into a raid.* | <li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add treasury = 50</li> |  |

| <a name="H91_our_roads">Clear Our Roads</a><br />*The Roadwarriors have long made use of the Dwarovar’s railways, even if the rails are long broken and battered beyond any use. However, with the transition to the Convoy, we find the roads more and more crowded by Dwarven reclaimers and other clans who seem to forget our might. We should remind these fools why we are known as the Roadwarriors.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_hold_surface</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 2963</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_special_subject_tt</li><li>set country flag [roadwarrior_subject_no_colonize](../flags/roadwarrior_subject_no_colonize.md)</li> | [Greater than Gold](#H91_greater_than_gold)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_shiny_and_kronium">Shiny and Kronium</a><br />*Amldhir is ours! Once the capital of Aul-Dwarov, now our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sits on the throne where once all the Serpentspine was ruled! There’s still plenty to plunder, including much of the metal which made Amldhir famous- Kronium. Heavy, dense and a perfect trophy to symbolize our victory. Kronium as well, when mixed in with many of our warpaints gives it an impressive sheen. With this, our warriors shall ride eternal, shiny and Kronium! * | <li>4119:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_amhildr until otherwise removed</li> | [Boys for the Band](#H91_boys_for_the_band)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_sapphires_in_the_sky">Sapphires in the Sky</a><br />*Dûr-Vazhatun was home to a curious kind of dwarf, a kind which obsessed with the world above the mountains. Such nonsense means little and less to us Roadwarriors, but the tools they used were made of many precious materials and things worth taking, and maybe we’ll find someone interested in the crazed drawings.* | <li>4020:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>add dip power = 100</li> | [Shiny and Kronium](#H91_shiny_and_kronium)<br /> |

| <a name="H91_ready_the_boys">Ready the Warboys</a><br />*Our Warriors need to be ready at all times, no matter what. At any moment an enemy warband may raid our camp, or a goblin tribe might try to plunder our loot, or one of our raiding parties might come under threat, or a chance to acquire loot that another band may be on the way for. The benefits are clear, even if we have to bash a few heads. * | <li>4056:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>add manpower = 2</li> | [Greater than Gold](#H91_greater_than_gold)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_boys_for_the_band">Boys for the Band</a><br />*The Roadwarriors continue to amass the greatest warband to ever roam the Serpentspine, but it cannot continue to grow without more hands. Orcs to tend to the rig, Orcs to gather supplies, Orcs to sort loot, and Orcs to make sure the previous two groups aren’t taking anything they shouldn’t. Of course, we also always need able bodies to throw at whatever fool tries to resist our might.* | <li>2931:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>set country flag [roadwarrior_on_the_go](../flags/roadwarrior_on_the_go.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_on_the_go_tt</li> | [Ready the Warboys](#H91_ready_the_boys)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_edge_of_the_world">Edge of the World</a><br />*The edge of the Dwarovar, or all the parts that matter, in any case. Khugdihr is a hold with many stories and tales, but none of those matter but the last- our conquest. Let the surface world burn in the flames of war, whilst we enjoy the cool dark roads we have pried for our own. The Gates of Khugdihr are shut, now and forevermore. The Dwarovar belongs to the Orcs!* | <li>2863:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_kugdihr until otherwise removed</li> | [Boys for the Band](#H91_boys_for_the_band)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_west_serpentspine">West Serpentspine</a><br />*The West Serpentspine was once the wealthiest part of the ancient Dwarovar, home to Amldhir, Mithradhûm, and many other holds of great wealth and renown. Now, its wealth lies with us, the Roadwarriors, and so we must now make it clear that just because we ride elsewhere, it does not mean that we still do not own these roads!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is roadwrrior_decolonize_west_dwarovar_tt</li><li>west dwarovar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is not city</li><li>is not a colony</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>manpower is at least 15</li> | <li>If west dwarovar region has terrain is dwarven road:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = roadwarrior_decolonized</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add manpower = -15</li> | [Edge of the World](#H91_edge_of_the_world)<br />[Sapphires in the Sky](#H91_sapphires_in_the_sky)<br /> |

| <a name="H91_into_the_reach">Into the Reach</a><br />*The Serpentsreach! Home to many dwarven holds, a few of which survived the fall of Aul-Dwarov. We should rectify this not only as soon as possible, but also plunder the reach for everything of value that we can pry out of the hands of any other clans or reclaimers that have tried to beat us to it.* | <li>capital is at least 2981</li> | <li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_into_reach for 10 years</li> | [Greater than Gold](#H91_greater_than_gold)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_go_faster_runes">Go Faster Runes</a><br />*Verkal Skomdihr was once the Dwarovar’s guard and check on the chaotic woodland beyond its gates. Many examples of runework are scattered throughout the hold, and while they may not necessarily be intact, there’s no doubt a few we can repurpose for our own needs…* | <li>4100:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_go_faster_runes until otherwise removed</li> | [Into the Reach](#H91_into_the_reach)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_diamond_in_the_ruins">A Diamond in the Ruins</a><br />*Arg-Ôrdstun, once among the greatest Holds of the ancient Dwarves, now lies in our hands! Diamonds, a fantastically durable material that can only be cut by itself or magic, may be the hold’s most famed item, but there’s still plenty of things that the Dwarves here gained by trade with those shiny stones. No reason we can’t- or shouldn’t, do the same… alongside taking that which they gained.* | <li>4093:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_tough_as_diamonds until otherwise removed</li> | [Go Faster Runes](#H91_go_faster_runes)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_orlghelovar">Orlghelovar</a><br />*The Glass of Orlghelovar was a form of artistry in its own right, and some kinds are unlike any we’ve plundered before. Naturally, this means we should strip the hold down to the last chamber in search of as much of it as possible.* | <li>4238:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = 200</li> | [A Diamond in the Ruins](#H91_diamond_in_the_ruins)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_the_reach">The Reach</a><br />*The Serpents’ Reach has been scoured. Every valuable thing we can find, taken. What we cannot take, we have destroyed. From the scoured halls of the Diamond Dwarves to the flames of Gor Bûrad, we are the undisputed masters of this domain, and let none be able to contest our might.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is roadwrrior_decolonize_serpentreach_tt</li><li>serpentreach region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is not city</li><li>is not a colony</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>manpower is at least 10</li> | <li>If serpentreach region has terrain is dwarven road:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = roadwarrior_decolonized</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add manpower = -10</li> | [Shazstundihr](#H91_shaztundihr)<br />[Orlghelovar](#H91_orlghelovar)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_at_the_gates">At the Gates</a><br />*Dookan was imprisoned by the ancient dwarven gods, this is well known, even to the most slow-witted orc. Korgus’ delusions about the surface world merely allowed the dwarven vermin back into our mountains, and took many skilled if deluded warriors to their deaths. But death is not the end, especially for the Roadwarriors. The dead, especially ours who die in battle, shall find themselves mustering an army in the afterlife to free Dookan from his chains! Thus, we should encourage our warriors, if they are to die, to do so in glorious battle, so one day Dookan shall finally be free.* | <li>capital is at least 4300</li> | <li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_at_the_gates for 25 years</li> | [East Serpentspine](#H91_east_serpentspine)<br />[The Reach](#H91_the_reach)<br />[West Serpentspine](#H91_west_serpentspine)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_back_to_the_road">Back to the Roads</a><br />*We have done it. From Khugdihr to Verkal Dromak and all caves, roads, and halls in between. There are no more holds left to conquer. No more roads left to roam… is what a fool would say! We are the Roadwarriors, and the Dwarovar is our domain to roam and to rule. Let none ever consider otherwise.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is roadwarrior_all_roads_tt</li><li>serpentspine:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is not city</li><li>is not a colony</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>manpower is at least 25</li> | <li>If serpentspine has terrain is dwarven road:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = roadwarrior_decolonized</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add manpower = -25</li><li>add splendor = 1000</li><li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_endless_roads until otherwise removed</li> | [At the Gates](#H91_at_the_gates)<br /> |

| <a name="H91_skewering_the_drake">Skewering the Drake</a><br />*The Skewered Drake Clan have long been settled in Gor Varzumbrog blocking us from moving eastwards into the Middle Dwarovar. Let us pay them a personal visit, and remind them that there is a price to pay for blocking our way. * | <li>4217:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_skewered_the_drake until otherwise removed</li> | [Greater than Gold](#H91_greater_than_gold)<br /> |
| <a name="H91_citrines_and_citrus">Citrines and Citrus</a><br />*Seghdihr was once a gateway to the middle Dwarovar, where the fruits of Salahad and Bulwar flowed. With the fall of Seghdihr to our hand, it is an excellent opportunity to exchange for some of these fruits with a few of the lesser trinkets and baubles we have plundered. Something other than fungus and cave meat will do wonders for the Boys.* | <li>4124:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_truce_breaks_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier roadwarrior_truce until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [Skewering the Drake](#H91_skewering_the_drake)<br /> |

| <a name="H91_east_serpentspine">East Serpentspine</a><br />*The East Serpentspine has always been seen as the origin of Dwarvenkind, and it is in this Origin that we shall wipe out the last of that legacy. The time of the Dwarovar has ended, and now the Roadwarriors rule supreme over the Serpentspine, and let those who contest so suffer our wrath!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is roadwrrior_decolonize_east_dwarovar_tt</li><li>middle dwarovar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is not city</li><li>is not a colony</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li></ul></ul></ul><li>tree of stone region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is not city</li><li>is not a colony</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>manpower is at least 15</li> | <li>If middle dwarovar region has terrain is dwarven road:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = roadwarrior_decolonized</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If tree of stone region has terrain is dwarven road:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = roadwarrior_decolonized</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add manpower = -15</li> | [Where Glory Awaits](#H91_where_glory_awaits)<br /> |

| <a name="H91_hold_of_gold">Hold of Gold</a><br />*Verkal Gulan survived the fall of the Dwarovar, but their own greed for the wealth within their walls have driven them to the brink of ruin many a time. Now, our warriors control the hold, and with it, its gold reserves. It is the Roadwarrior’s time to pillage what wealth we can, and ensure that none shall ever take advantage of whatever wealth we cannot take with us.* | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>add treasury = 500</li> | [Skewering the Drake](#H91_skewering_the_drake)<br /> |

It is in Grozhumdihr that this strange world met with the familiar caves and caverns of the Serpentspine. It is here, as well, the ancient Dwarves gathered that lands’ bounties- and after our efforts, they are ours now! It is well that we have no interest in their land, for the Raj that rules Rahen is weak and pitiful indeed. * | <li>4265:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has province modifier roadwarrior_decolonized</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = roadwarrior_overdrive_tt</li><li>add mil power = 200</li> | [Citrines and Citrus](#H91_citrines_and_citrus)<br />[Hold of Gold](#H91_hold_of_gold)<br /> |
