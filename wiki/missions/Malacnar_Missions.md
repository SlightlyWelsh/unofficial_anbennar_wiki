| <a name="G32_rally_greatest">Rally Our Greatest</a><br />*Everybody in Malacnar needs to contribute. The noblest warriors descended from Levodas's companions need to set an example for newer ones; priests need to infuse the spirits of the population with courage and determination, and secure the favour of the holy Ynn River; merchant guilds need to secure money, equipment and new warriors from abroad. Do not fail, for history is not kind to those who fail.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier malacnar_build_three for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G32_deep_breath">A Deep Breath Before War</a><br />*We have come far; farther than the ancient Kingdom of Malacnar at its apex. Perhaps even farther than Galadorn thought we would when he took up the sword of Varmeljon in 1377. To celebrate this moment our Battleking is doing something unprecedented: he declared a decade of peace; meaning cessation of wars, meaning we won't attack any of our neighbours.\n\nIf anybody is unhappy with this - the Battleking declared - they are free to sort things out with him by visiting his residence at the gardens of Grebniesth, where he and his companions will be tending to the flowers for the duration of the edict.* | <li>1182:</li><ul><li>owned by companion is yes</li></ul><li>is institution enabled is renaissance</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is at war</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has ruler modifier g32_cowardly_battleking</li><li>has ruler modifier  g32_untested_battleking</li></ul><li>stability is at least 1</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>If does not have owns is 1182:</li><ul><li>1182:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier malacnar_moment_peace for 15 years</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = malacnar_peace</li><li>country gets the modifier malacnar_moment_peace for 15 years</li><li>country gets the modifier g32_battleking_grace_period for 15 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set ai personality:</li><ul><li>personality = ai_diplomat</li><li>locked = no</li></ul></ul> | [Rally Our Greatest](#G32_rally_greatest)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_rebirth_sword">Rebirth by the Sword</a><br />*The "Grebniesther Period", as it came to be known, has allowed us to take a step back and reflect on many things.\n\nFor one, even the City of Warriors can find itself short on fighters; it is important we launch recruitment campaigns across our conquered territories and teach the townspeople and village-goers a fraction of our military tradition.\n\nSecondly, our Battleking's prolonged residence in Grebniesth has helped further weaken what was once considered a taboo: that is, raising and training Malacnari warriors outside of Malacnar; we'd make good to capitalize on this, and normalize this practice.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all state province:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier malacnar_haven_warriors for 20 years</li> | [A Deep Breath Before War](#G32_deep_breath)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_life_spear">Life by the Spear</a><br />*For years new people have been climbing the southern cliffs to establish themselves all around the outskirts of the Ynn. Where there were once empty prairies and plains as far as the eye could see, towns and settlements have appeared and are growing at worrying rates. New nations, created overnight, are able to field armies of equal number to Ynnic hosts.\n\nBefore these people reverse into our Ynnic heartlands and drown us out - not that it wouldn't be a glorious spectacle to watch - we'd be good to discover their secret and use it for our own good.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all state province:</li><ul><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li></ul><li>amount is at least 4</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier malacnar_glory_workers for 20 years</li> | [Rebirth by the Sword](#G32_rebirth_sword)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_death_iron">Death by Iron</a><br />*Malacnar controls one of the largest iron deposits in the Ynn, famously capable of arming more soldiers than an Emperor could gather. But now that we've taken the secrets of the Cannorians, their efficient army housings and advanced conscription techniques are letting us gather armies of unparalleled size, and our weaponsmiths are hard-pressed to keep up the pace.\n\nA development effort has thus been called by the Battleking, who will procure the smiths with all they need in order “to drown the world in weapons”.* | <li>owns core province 1169</li><li>1169:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li> | <li>1169:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = weapons</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul></ul> | [Life by the Spear](#G32_life_spear)<br />[The Values of a Soldier](#G32_values)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_wealth_upper_ynn">Wealth of the Upper Ynn</a><br />*The cities of Vareynn and Svemel, the dams of Mocbarja and Bosancovac. By now their people have gotten used to our rule, and to sharing part of their wealth with our warriors. As a reward, we will amplify their market squares, so that the wealth that passes through them is even greater.* | <li>1191:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>1186:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>1165:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>1171:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If has 1191 has province has center of trade of level is 1; and does not have 1191 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>1191:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 200</li></ul><li>If has 1171 has province has center of trade of level is 1; and does not have 1171 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>1171:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 200</li></ul><li>1186:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>1165:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Death by Iron](#G32_death_iron)<br />[Discipline](#G32_discipline)<br /> |

| <a name="G32_malacnari_identity">Malacnari Identity</a><br />*Malacnar's culture is one of the most ancient in the world after Flood. When Lukaus and his horseriders swept up the northern Ynn River Valley, they renamed it Dolindha and subdued Malacnar for a time, but we rose up again. When Vareynn and the Empire ruled over us, we kept our spirit and our way of life, or else we wouldn't stand here now as the masters of the Ynn.\n\nHowever, Malacnari language was gradually abandoned during the Imperial period, with even past Battlekings preferring to use Dolindhan in day-to-day life. Now that we have revived the glory of Malacnar, we will revive the beauty of Malacnari language.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has reform malacnar_republic_reform</li><li>has reform  malacnar_monarchy_reformed</li></ul><li>owns core province 1169</li><li>1169:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>change primary culture = malacnari</li><li>set ruler culture = malacnari</li><li>If has heir:</li><ul><li>set heir culture = malacnari</li></ul><li>1169:</li><ul><li>change culture = malacnari</li></ul><li>If has owns core province is 1168:</li><ul><li>1168:</li><ul><li>change culture = malacnari</li></ul></ul><li>If has owns core province is 2808:</li><ul><li>2808:</li><ul><li>change culture = malacnari</li></ul></ul><li>If has owns core province is 2812:</li><ul><li>2812:</li><ul><li>add culture construction:</li><ul><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has owns core province is 1186:</li><ul><li>1186:</li><ul><li>add culture construction:</li><ul><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has owns core province is 1170:</li><ul><li>1170:</li><ul><li>add culture construction:</li><ul><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier malacnar_warrior_culture for 30 years</li> | [Wealth of the Upper Ynn](#G32_wealth_upper_ynn)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_southern_control">Southern Control</a><br />*The southern lordlings of Sarda always controlled a great deal of wealth: not only from the money they are able to extort for the passage of barges, but also from trading with visitors from beneath the Cliffs. Let the Sarda know: the days of playing bridge trolls with the dams are over. Let the Cannorians know: they will be speaking with our officers now.\n\nOur generals know just the place for a southern headquarters: the city of Arverynn. The decaying, decadent capital of the Ynnic Empire was founded by a great Soldier-Emperor, Calrodiy I, and its central structure, the Teal Keep, still bears the solemnity to inspire a true army. From it, our generals will put the Jewel of the Ynn into shape, and keep an ample garrison ready to strike at the rest of Sarda.* | <li>owns core province 1138</li><li>1138:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>owns core province  1133</li><li>1133:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>owns core province   1139</li><li>1139:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>culture is malacnari</li></ul> | <li>1139:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add center of trade level = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = malacnar_southern</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Malacnari Identity](#G32_malacnari_identity)<br />[Obedience](#G32_obedience)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_lifeblood_unshed">Lifeblood Unshed</a><br />*Emperors tried in the past to connect and develop their massive territory, though the roads they built were washed away by floods or rotted by the grass, the towns they founded were conquered by barbarians or sold out by their own defenders, and the buildings they commissioned were plunged into the blue River or reclaimed by the greenery.\n\nRed is a much better colour for an Empire.\nOne symbolizing life, one symbolizing death.\n\nThe new Empire that has arisen flies the blood-red banner of Malacnar, and for as long as our soldiers have blood in their veins and our state gold in its coffers, we will see to it that all along the Ynn new towns will prosper, flying the blood-red banners of their benefactors high, connected by roads well-maintained because the soldiers and goods that travel across them are the lifeblood of an Empire.* | <li>ynn riverside:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li><li>culture group is ynnic_ruinborn_elf</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>province group is ynn_riverside</li><li>culture is malacnari</li></ul><li>amount is at least 8</li></ul> | <li>1168:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = malacnar_ynn</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = malacnar_ynn_path</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has province group is ynn riverside, and does not have province id is 1168:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = malacnar_ynn</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Southern Control](#G32_southern_control)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_school_of_war">The Coghna Schilisht</a><br />*Ancient Malacnari wisdom suggests that life - with its fierce blows and harrowing battles - is the sole teacher a warrior needs. The ancient Malacnari didn't have access to several cultures from across the world, extensive treaties on ever-evolving military tactics, wonderful universities staffed by the best teachers, or simply the free time to pause, relax and rethink their methods.\n\nThe Coghna Schilist - School of War - in Malacnar will offer this and much more, and many similar institutes will be built throughout the country.\nFools say “Warriors don't read books”, masters say “The mind is one's sharpest weapon”.\n\nAnd, since the Battlekings never asked of the warriors something they wouldn't do themselves, they will be leading at the forefront in this new field as well by attending classes and proving there is no shame in learning, even for an accomplished master.* | <li>yrw has settled fourth debate is yes</li><li>owns core province 1169</li><li>1169:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li><li>has building university</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>culture is malacnari</li><li>has building university</li></ul><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>1169:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = malacnar_school</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = commandant</li><li>name = "Ivratan Krulav"</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.25</li><li>culture = malacnari</li></ul><li>the event [A Lesson in Valor](../events/a_lesson_in_valor.md) happens</li> | [Lifeblood Unshed](#G32_lifeblood_unshed)<br />[Courage](#G32_courage)<br /> |

Aren't there times when two fighters who are loyal and well coordinated with each other can beat a much stronger warrior? Aren't there times when individualism falters against a wall of shields?\n\nIt might be time to take a page off Vareynn's book, and teach our citizens a series of virtues to champion and uphold, rather than leaving everything to the whims of the individual fighter.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li><li>num of infantry is at least 20</li><li>Have an advisor of type army_organiser</li><li>army tradition is at least 40</li> | <li>add prestige = 5</li><li>country gets the modifier malacnar_values for 20 years</li> | [Rebirth by the Sword](#G32_rebirth_sword)<br /> |

| <a name="G32_obedience">Obedience</a><br />*Malacnar is ruled by the strongest. There is no need to doubt this as any weak Battleking will soon find a death in battle. And so will any unsubordinate warrior, if they try to sabotage him or question his orders.\n\nPunishments will be set: warriors who insult, unprovokedly attack or otherwise disobey their betters will be stripped of their main weapon, assigned spears and javelins, then sent to the forefront of the battle line where they will have to contend with the enemy's mouths of fire. This practice, known as "javelining", will in time ensure that only the most tough - or most obedient - of our soldiers will come out on top.* | <li>num of infantry is at least 40</li><li>army tradition is at least 60</li><li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>add prestige = 15</li><li>country gets the modifier malacnar_obediance until otherwise removed</li><li>remove country modifier = malacnar_discipline</li> | [Discipline](#G32_discipline)<br />[Battleking of the Ynnics](#G32_battleking_ynnics)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_courage">Courage</a><br />*How could we forget the core quality of a warrior? When your companions are trembling, when you are facing a new enemy, a new weapon or a monster you've never seen before, courage is the quality that keeps you on the field, and allows you to win and prosper rather than turn tail and be ignobly cut down. In the worst case, you will have bought your companions precious time to escape, and you'll have kept high the fame of Malacnar.\n\nThe Battlekings have always been champions of this virtue, and never asked of their subordinates to do something they wouldn't do, going as far as sacrificing themselves to allow their troops to retreat ever since Battleking Morvarad did so in 143 at the Battle of Grebniesth. We will never forget their sacrifices, for as long as our soldiers' spirits are tempered by fire.* | <li>num of infantry is at least 50</li><li>army tradition is at least 70</li><li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>add prestige = 20</li><li>country gets the modifier malacnar_courage until otherwise removed</li><li>remove country modifier = malacnar_obediance</li> | [Southern Control](#G32_southern_control)<br />[Obedience](#G32_obedience)<br />[Pathway to the Beyond](#G32_pathway_beyond)<br /> |
| <a name="G32_glory">Glory</a><br />*Every battle fought, every virtue followed, every sacrifice made, it all concurs to the pursuit of a greater dream. For many ancient warriors and Battlekings, this dream was glory: there is nothing better than being glorious, to be surrounded with oathsworn companions, loving wives, and cheering admirers. To be crowned Battleking of Malacnar, to have conquered it all and rule uncontested. And today, every step, every revolt, every battle we've fought concurs to the realization of their dream.\n\nEven if we may fall one day, like every warrior does eventually, and every Empire too, let us celebrate and rest today.\n\nWe may weep.* | <li>num of infantry is at least 60</li><li>army tradition is at least 90</li><li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li><li>prestige is at least 90</li><li>has a three star general commanding an army</li><li>has ruler modifier g32_legendary_battleking</li><li>owns core province 1169</li><li>1169:</li><ul><li>development is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier malacnar_glory until otherwise removed</li> | [The Coghna Schilisht](#G32_school_of_war)<br />[Courage](#G32_courage)<br />[Punish the Savages](#G32_punish_savages)<br /> |

Most curious are their weapons - swords, spears and bows are often discarded in favour of weapons that can shoot fire and metal with the simple gesture of a finger.
