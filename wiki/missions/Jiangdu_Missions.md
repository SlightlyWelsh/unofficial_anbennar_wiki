| <a name="jiangdu_koboldz">Gilded Kobolds</a><br />*The Golden Yalong in Balrijin have supplied the rebel of Lanhinjui, and allowed them to momentarily escape our grasp. This is treason of the highest order, and provoke dire consequences for the Yalong. They attempted to destroy our nation, and take the lives of our people. By attempting to harm the citizens of our Golden Kingdom, they have sealed the fate of theirs. * | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>balrijin area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4976:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>4976:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_northern_fortress</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add prestige = 15</li> | [A New Beginning](#jiangdu_new_beginning)<br /> |

The Yalong of these lands are angered at the overthrowing of their nobility. They have done nothing to harm us yet, maybe it would be better to integrate them into Jiangdu Society. We could see the benefits of their ways working for us, along with educating the golden kobolds why they should be happy under their new rulers.* | <li>accepted culture is goldscale_kobold</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0</li></ul><li>stability is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier jiangdu_tolerancy until otherwise removed</li> | [Gilded Kobolds](#jiangdu_koboldz)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_northern_legion">Northern Legion</a><br />*We struggle against all of the raiders in our Northern Border. Their birds are faster than our cavalry, and they raid, they purge, then destroy while running away on the backs of these feathered beasts. No longer. As Li√°n Zhu famously said, to crush somebody, 'Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.' Luckily for us, a group of northern rebels have come to us for a deal. We give them a hefty sum of money, and they fight for us. We can counter the niao with their own tactics, and once again force the riders to play by our rules.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>If xuanbing area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tzunguan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If yiguan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If jiantsiang area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_northern_legion</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Tolerant Society](#jiangdu_tolerant_society)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_consolidate_north">Consolidate North</a><br />*Our conquests are straining our nation. Before, we were able to properly manage these regions thanks to our supply chains, which have existed for centuries. Now the roads that we have once used, and all the Cun, Zhen, and Zhuang have all been torn down, and the peasants are not keen on their reestablishment. To 'pacify' the baikshi of our ancestral land, we should remind them who are the true rulers of this land.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>num of generals is at least 3</li><li>army tradition is at least 50</li><li>army size is at least 30</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.5</li> | <li>If jinqiu area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Northern Legion](#jiangdu_northern_legion)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_end_northern">End Northern Threat</a><br />*Raiders, pillagers, barbarians, call them whatever. They ride on birds and march into enemy lands with skill. We have prepared for this. Our Northern Legions are ready. While they take care of their birds, we shall take care of the hordes and riders. They may have seen it coming, ever since thousands of men abandoned their ranks, but we are sure that they will not be prepared.\n\nOur golden armies await your orders, great ruler. * | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>jinqiu area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>jianzhong area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>tzunguan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>xuanbing area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>yiguan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>jiantsiang area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>4923:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4919:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4862:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If has dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>add splendor = 400</li><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 40</li></ul></ul><li>4923:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_northern_fortress</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4919:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_northern_fortress</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4862:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_northern_fortress</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Consolidate North](#jiangdu_consolidate_north)<br /> |

| <a name="jiangdu_no_same_mistake">No Same Mistake Twice</a><br />*Rebels. \n\nRebels are scum. Although they are our people, it reaches a point to where they may as well be a different country, with different ideas, and different goals to ours. That is exactly what had happened to us years ago, but now that we are at this position again, we must consolidate our lands and rule with an iron fist. Soon they will come to join us, but for now they are angry, blood red, flowing with misled rage. \n\nRebels are scum, so we will have to treat them as such, and give an example to those who are on the fence to who their allegiance is with.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 1</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li> | <li>country gets the modifier jiangdu_crush_the_rebels until otherwise removed</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -150</li> | [A New Beginning](#jiangdu_new_beginning)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_first_command_city">Command City</a><br />*We have come to invest in our capital with great lengths, and have seen through its growth and repairs. We now see that this is not enough. Organization of our capital is key to growth. The more stable a city, a region, a country is, the more it strengthens its bonds with the land, the people, and the power. We have devised a system of Command Cities that will work for us just like that. We shall start with our own capital, the first Command City.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>4868:</li><ul><li>development is at least 35</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 75</li> | <li>the event [Command City of Jiangdu](../events/command_city_of_jiangdu.md) happens</li><li>If jinjiang area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If jianzhong area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If beikyuan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4871:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add treasury = -75</li> | [Crushing the Rebels](#jiangdu_crash_rebels)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_control_river">Control the River</a><br />*We are a major upriver city along the great Yanhe, and have developed a great city along its banks. Unfortunately for us, we are often overlooked by another, the City of Tianlou. Oftentimes we find ourselves in trade conflict over the regions we once controlled with a grip mightier than gods. Once it slipped, Tianlou took over. Now, the lands are in their sphere of influence, but they are not too far gone. We have made the preparations, and have given strength to the first Command City, our capital. It is best that we use our momentum and march on our rivals. If we manage to take the great city, we would have a new city of great power within the region under our grasp, and our historical holds back as well. It will be great.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>jinjiang area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>4871:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>jinjiang area:</li><ul><li>add local autonomy = -20</li></ul><li>4871:</li><ul><li>add local autonomy = -20</li></ul> | [Command City](#jiangdu_first_command_city)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_continue_marsh">Continue the March</a><br />*We have obliterated the armies of our foes with our Zhengdao, and have taken the city of Tianlou for ourselves. Now, we have made many enemies with the foes we have taken land from, and they have vengeance locked within their heads. It will be better to slay them now than to let them fester like a rotting corpse. The Chendekshensuan, arrives today, and it bashes against the hearts of chaos. We are the representatives of the Chendekshensuan, and our kingdom shall be great, but first, it is our duty to rid the world of the demons who have come to rule what is truly ours.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>jianzhong area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>beikyuan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>4871:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_command_city</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If yanzhong area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If beidugang area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tianlou area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If mulim area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If linyuan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If linghui area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Control the River](#jiangdu_control_river)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_tianlou_city">Command City of Tianlou</a><br />*We have managed to overthrow the rulers of Tianlou and instated ourselves as the sovereign of the region. We now have a clear pathway to economic and political domination of the region, for all the kingdoms now have to respect our rules and decisions. Unfortunately, unlike the rest of our lands, Tianlou is big, and scarily unstable for an outsider to control. We must solidify our watch of the city and ensure the security of our kingdom, for a new Command City has been birthed.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>4871:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>4871:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_tianlou_golden</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Continue the March](#jiangdu_continue_marsh)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_cloths_of_szicheng">Cloth of Szicheng</a><br />*For the highest of the highest, the cloth of Szicheng is a sign of pure nobility. Something a mere peasant only hears rumors of. But why? The quality, that is why. The silk is tightly woven yet silky smooth, making it able to survive a slash of even the finest blades. Some speculate it must be magic. Now that we own the city, it is time we take advantage and begin making our own Szicheng silk, for our own profits. We will respect their traditions, but by adding their silk into cloths and banners, not only will we be able to show our wealth and strength without combat, but we will also be able to profit at the same time.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>4846:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>4846:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_cloths_of_szicheng</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Crushing Our Enemies](#jiangdu_crashing_enemies)<br /> |

The rebellious state of Lanjinhui and their allies in the Kobolds, also known as the Yalong of Balrijin, have managed to tarnish decades of work by our generals by forcing us back all the way to our capital. We have fallen to embarrassing levels, with the majority of our country having been lost to the peasantry.\n\nHow can we, the birthplace of the world‚Äôs greatest generals, allow their reputation to be tarnished and their country stolen?

It will not be easy by any means, but we are men of Jiangdu. Who are some peasants to put us to rest? No, we fight back. We are dragons, armed to the brim, our military history spans centuries.\n\nA new era is upon us, and the men of Jiangdu will fight to the death to usher our kingdom into it.* | <li>erluxi area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>ningxiang area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>liuminxiang area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [New Beginning](../events/new_beginning.md) happens</li><li>If balrijin area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier jiangdu_new_beginning for 15 years</li> | [The Army of Reconquest](#jiangdu_create_reconquest_army)<br /> |

Thus, we will scour the fields, and search the hills for them. We will finish what we have started, and slay all possibilities of another revolt. The people are our subjects, and if they want to revolt, they can face the consequences.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>army size is at least 14</li> | <li>the event [Crushing the Rebels](../events/crushing_the_rebels.md) happens</li> | [A New Beginning](#jiangdu_new_beginning)<br /> |

Unfortunately, what we cannot say we have is a good model for this army. They are new recruits who are unaware of true combat outside of a few skirmishes where we held the advantage. They must be taught how to survive, how to win battles that seem impossible. Fortunately, we have the tools to teach such, and the model of Li√°n Zhu's teachings. We simply need to find a willing general with the experience that we require.\n\nLuckily, we know a perfect candidate. * | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>army size is at least 20</li> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>define general:</li><ul><li>name = "Jian Hangzu"</li><li>fire = 4</li><li>shock = 4</li><li>manuever = 3</li><li>siege = 2</li></ul> | [Crushing the Rebels](#jiangdu_crash_rebels)<br /> |
| <a name="jiangdu_city_yanzhong">The Command of Yanzhong</a><br />*Yanzhong is an important city of note for being, well, big. Belonging to the kingdom of its namesake, and holding a key position along the Yanhe, we have taken the city under our reigns, for it was obvious that the rulers of the city managed it poorly. This city will do us wonders, for it will allow us to control the Yanhe even further, and expand our administrative and trade abilities. Before we turn it into a Command City though, we must rebuild the city from the crumbles and ashes that the former keepers have left it in. A polished city is better than a dirty one, after all.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>yanzhong area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>linyuan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>4859:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 35</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>4859:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jiangdu_command_city</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If tianszi area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If anjiang area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Continue the March](#jiangdu_continue_marsh)<br /> |

Yet as our nation grows larger, it comes to our attention that we are constantly in a battle against insurgency and chaos for control over our land and our people. \n\nIn areas where there is less of a presence from our troops, it has been harder to secure the lands because the people remain angry.

At our lowest point, when we were reduced to the city of Jiangdu, this hit a breaking point. Tradition was abandoned in favor of survival, and resources were drawn out from the military to save our struggling nature. While we managed to save ourselves from the brink, a portion of our tactics and skill were lost. The state of our military and its governance should not resemble our lowest, but should bring us to its highest. \n\nThus, plans were drafted to begin the process of reforging our army organization, into something new. A dragon needs no armor, it has plenty of strength already. It needs to evolve, to learn, for if a dragon becomes complacent with its skill, it will surely be slain.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>army tradition is at least 90</li> | <li>add mil power = 200</li> | [Strict Warriors](#jiangdu_strict_warriors)<br /> |

To enforce this, it is time we begin the process of building the Great Military Academy, centered in Jiangdu. Thousands shall be sent to the Academy, where they will be shown the thousand strategies that shall teach them the basics to the minute details that could save a soldier in a time of despair.
