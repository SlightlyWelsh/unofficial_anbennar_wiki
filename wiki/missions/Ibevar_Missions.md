| <a name="A32_launching_construction">Launching Construction</a><br />*While the Silent Repose has long served adequately as a place one can escape the world, the centuries-old structures have begun to show their age, and, despite their high-minded influence from the old styles of our homelands, they are becoming dilapidated. Such decay, while nowhere close to squalor, is wholly unbefitting of the stature of our elders.\n\nNot only do we need to simply restore these older structures, but we must plan for the future, as the scope of our project means a new influx of residents will far surpass the former population of the Repose. If we're truly committed to creating a place for our elders to grow old, ‘til they reach their final days, Ibevar must make a serious investment in renovating their mountain home.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>owns core province 350</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>350:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ibevar_building_antirionn</li><li>duration = 12775</li></ul></ul> | [Protecting Our Elders](#A32_protecting_our_elders)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_antirionn">Antirionn</a><br />*The Repose has been shaped anew. Where once stood a humble village, now lies Antirionn, The Settlement of the Ancients. The core principles of its design, standing as a fortified home for the care of our most venerable and infirm have been maintained. But, more vitally, it has been expanded far beyond the wildest dreams of its founders.\n\nThe new city shines bright as a beacon of elven civilization, bronze-capped spires jutting into the sky above the elegant curves of the buildings below. Sleepy streets are lined with carefully tended gardens filled with the most beautiful plants in all of Halann, kept in perpetual bloom by the tender touch of our mages. We've taken care to optimize our trade network, and ensure that a stream of the finest luxuries from across the world continually pours in, to ensure that our elders may have a taste of the foreign and exotic in their very homes, with no need to wander the world and endanger themselves in pursuit of it.\n\nAt the center of it all, the peak of the mountain lays a newly constructed temple, built to house the heirlooms of our greatest elders, of lineages long passed. Its façade depicts scenes from the history of our people, the greatest deeds of our elders cast in marble, with a great statue of Munas Moonsinger, the deified leader of the Remnant Fleet, watching over all. This place should help to unite the hearts of our people, remind us that we are one.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>owns core province 350</li><li>350:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ibevar_building_antirionn</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>350:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ibevar_antirionn</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Launching Construction](#A32_launching_construction)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_by_the_bottom">By The Bottom</a><br />*While the elegant and ancient styles of combat practiced by our troops for centuries have fallen from favor, Ibevar has nonetheless dedicated itself to an army that still lives up to elven expectations. Well-educated, fresh-faced troops, schooled with an understanding of tactics that supplements their officers, and creates an understanding of their importance in the role of our army and state. Our system of patriotic education will encourage the new, more abundant generations of our kind to take up arms and serve in the defense of their homeland.\n\nThe trend toward drilled tactics has easily supplemented our existing focus on a well-disciplined professional army, allowing for a greater rate of fire and more complex on-field movements. In addition, recognizing the inherent value of elven life, we've put more of an investment than most in the creation of new armors that can soak up bullets, and decrease the penetrative depth of our enemies' shot, increasing the rate of survival amongst those wounded.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>mil power is at least 250</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier ibevar_modernizing_the_army</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 2</li><li>stability is at least 3</li> | <li>add years of income = -2</li><li>add mil power = -250</li><li>add army professionalism = 0.05</li><li>add army tradition = -10</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_by_the_bottom until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_modernizing_the_army for 10 years</li> | [Modernizing The Army](#A32_modernizing_the_army)<br /> |

| <a name="A32_break_the_status_quo">Breaking The Status Quo</a><br />*It has become exceedingly clear that the sovereignty granted to the Silent Repose is something of a mistake… While we hold nothing but respect for our most venerable, we cannot necessarily say they're our most wise. The repose's rule has permitted troublemakers like Pelodir to fill the heads of those elves who are often furthest removed from the workings of the contemporary world with all sorts of irresponsible notions.\n\nRather than living the quiet retirement they deserve, some of our elders have been convinced to waste their lives by venturing in against the Greentide, or as that madman grumbles, venturing across the sea to Aelantir. We'll more properly integrate the Repose's order into our own governance, to see that their leadership may be free of these silly notions.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has disaster ibevar_reformation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>A83:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>is not at war</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>owns 350</li></ul> | <li>If has A83 has exists:</li><ul><li>the event [Troublesome Elders](../events/troublesome_elders.md) happens</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 5</li></ul> | [Secure the Succession](#A32_secure_the_succession)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_protecting_our_elders">Protecting Our Elders</a><br />*With the Silent Repose in our care, we can see to it that our elders receive the tender care that they need, and are no longer led astray by those who would lead them to harm in a world they often fail to understand.\n\nWhile their guidance and experience are invaluable, it's time we create a more formal system to see that we avoid the failures that have often stemmed from those who are out of step with the modern world's grudges and quirks holding progress back for the centuries that they might remain in a position within our administration.\n\nWe shall see to it that those who simply want to retire, or any who remain with the past long enough to become a thorn in our side are given the opportunity to relocate to the Repose, and live out the rest of their days in peace, away from anything important that they might otherwise delay or disrupt.* | <li>owns core province 350</li><li>is not at war</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>war exhaustion is at least 0.1</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 350</li> | <li>add treasury = -350</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_taking_care_of_elders for 50 years</li> | [Breaking The Status Quo](#A32_break_the_status_quo)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_council_of_the_ancients">Council Of The Ancients</a><br />*Since the forcible retirement of some of our more venerable leaders, we've found ourselves in a poorer state, for want of their expertise. While they may not be attuned to every issue of the day, we must strive to ensure that their more useful knowledge can remain in circulation. We'll create the bureaucratic framework for a body of elders, which can be called upon to consult on most any subject in our realm.\n\nOrganized by their expertise, rather than simply seniority, our new Council of the Ancients shall strive to make it as convenient as possible to put our people in touch with venerable experts, those elders knowledgeable in any field of study, any trade that has been plied in our lands. With this intergenerational exchange, we'll doubtlessly spur new ideas, and help to re-integrate or rework those ideas that might well be forgotten as our elders pass away.* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>government reform progress is at least 150</li> | <li>change government reform progress = -150</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [council_of_the_ancients_reform_flag](../flags/council_of_the_ancients_reform_flag.md)</li></ul><li>add government reform = council_of_the_ancients_reform</li> | [Protecting Our Elders](#A32_protecting_our_elders)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_expanding_east">Expanding East</a><br />*The Kingdom of Farraneán, our oldest and most bitter rivalry. Rightfully wiped from the face of Cannor by the Greentide, their realm of brigands and dissidents was formed by a human squatter on lands ceded to us following the defeat of the Sorcerer-King and a rebellious province of our homeland. Seeing as those traitors fled back into our arms at the first sign of orcish trouble, we can tap the expertise of those elves in settling these lands with proper, upstanding folk.\n\nThe rivers shall be filled with the music and barges of the spring's Cogaulúis Ball, the Caseán shall stand fast in defense of our realm… But, we shall see that no new Scogtrín blooms in Escin. After all, why should we use our magics to push back a curse that has never troubled our own people?\n\nPerhaps in its continued absence, the Cardesti's curse and those other ill magics of the vale will rise again against the humans to keep them from our home. No longer will they seduce our most naïve and tender-hearted into the foolery of diluting their blood, and cursing their children with the maladies of age and death so long before their time.* | <li>whistlevale area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>cursewood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_expanding_east for 50 years</li> | [Prosperous Ibevar](#A32_prosperous_ibevar)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_modernizing_the_army">Modernizing The Army</a><br />*Ibevar has long been known for the quality of its armies, a trait that helped it to define the border of the Greentide's expansion and, in conjunction with its diplomatic expertise, allowed its armies to function more in providing a show of force, rather than actually shed the blood of its people. However, the expert archers, the old tactics for which this army has long been renowned are becoming irrelevant with the march of time. If we were to take the input of some advisors from other states, along with that of the Council of Elders, and fresh-faced experts on the ground, we could redefine our expertise.\n\nAdditionally, while we had long supplied soldiers of merit with some parts of their equipment, we shall standardize our uniforms and arms. With the pace of Cannor's development threatening to outstrip the speed at which our state moves, we're analyzing a variety of plans as to how to create a more flexible military administration. We've handed a pension and ticket to Antirionn to any veterans who cannot adapt to these changes.* | <li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.4</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 150</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_modernizing_the_army for 10 years</li> | [Safe Home](#A32_safe_home)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_by_the_top">By The Top</a><br />*Our plans to create a more efficient military administration have borne fruit. We've organized our most merited officers, the brightest from the Blaíddscal into a body alongside experts in other fields relevant to command, creating a unique body, a general staff service. This body, our military's answer to the shared expertise of the Council of Elders, is constantly tasked with analyzing our logistical practices and failures, accounts of battles from across Cannor, simulating new tactics with our troops, and gathering intelligence on all new military developments across the continent, in cooperation with our spies. With the increased efficiency in this preservation and exchange of knowledge, it will be much easier to incorporate new developments, and respond to, or even avert failures and inefficiencies in our existing army.* | <li>mil power is at least 250</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier ibevar_modernizing_the_army</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 2</li><li>stability is at least 3</li> | <li>add mil power = -250</li><li>add army professionalism = 0.05</li><li>add army tradition = -10</li><li>add years of income = -2</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_by_the_top until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_modernizing_the_army for 10 years</li> | [Modernizing The Army](#A32_modernizing_the_army)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_ibevari_soldier">Ibevari Soldier</a><br />*While a few of our more adaptable veterans remain, the Ibevari soldier is a new soldier indeed. The coming generation of elves has been raised with a keen sense of the value of our military. The strongest, boldest, those with the most flexible and brilliant minds have been shepherded into the service. This core of loyal, disciplined, and well-drilled soldiers able to bring modern tactics and arms to bear on par with any other nation at the cutting edge of Cannorian innovation.\n\nWhile other nations with abundant populations of peasants to waste in war simply throw their men onto the battlefield in the clothes they'd wear to tend a cornfield, Ibevari soldiers are clad in light but durable armor, conforming to elven aesthetics while dampening the impact of shot. Our professional soldiers are renowned for their dedication to drilled tactics, with their fire drills and a variety of formations and tactics practiced daily with the enthusiasm one might give to a sport.* | <li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.8</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ibevar_the_ibevari_soldier until otherwise removed</li> | [By The Top](#A32_by_the_top)<br />[By The Bottom](#A32_by_the_bottom)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_elfrealm_of_the_north">Elfrealm Of The North</a><br />*While Arbaran was once an Elfrealm, much as ours, the loss of Ianren the Rider to the barbarians in the Greatwoods harkened a quick decline. Having died without naming an heir, his nobles made the fatal mistake of electing Calasandur's half-blood to the throne, their line only degrading from there. And then, those fools split his realm amongst barbarous mercenaries, throwing away the territories that Ianren, Calasandur, and all those who sacrificed themselves in combating Black Castanor.\n\nOur kin in Elvenaire and across Arbaran are exploited by the CLSTC, their expertise used to produce the fine goods which the company used to attain its fame. Let's see that they get their fair share of the recognition and profit, while we push up to the borders of those Gawedi Barbarians, and the fine forests in which they squat.* | <li>arbaran area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>golden plains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>cestir area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li> | [Ibevari Expansion](#A32_ibevari_expansion)<br /> |

| <a name="A32_secure_the_succession">Secure the Succession</a><br />*Before one can change the world, they must learn to change themself. So too must Ibevar change, before we can turn our gaze to the lands beyond. We must mend the great rift within our realm, and set ourselves upon a new course. The Elfrealm of Ibevar has long been held back by the past. Elders, out of touch with the world around us bring failure with dated tactics and policies, holding back change for centuries on end. Our traditionalists' stubborn insistence that the gods of Cannor are dead will doubtlessly magnify the outrage of any transgression against the borders of our neighbors.\n\nBut, why should we appease the "half-elves" who scramble to claim that even the smallest droplets of elven blood put them above other humans? Surely, with the superiority they believe our blood grants, it would be more than befitting to see ourselves become the caretakers of any particularly useful lands among their holdings. But more pressingly yet, the line of ta'Lunateín is without an heir, and Ibenion's days are numbered. Even with an elven lifespan, it's beyond time for our bachelor prince to find his successor, and see that our realm might not fall to strife in his absence.* | <li>has heir</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li> |  |
| <a name="A32_prosperous_ibevar">Prosperous Ibevar</a><br />*We have given our people the kind of elfrealm that our forebears aspired to build. A new set of gods venerated alongside those who came before. Secured the knowledge of our elders, a new heir to Ibenion's legacy. But is it enough?\n\nWe've seen how Arbaran shrank away, from the home of the honorable Ianren's elfrealm, to a squalor of squabbling marches run by no more than humans, who still cling to the name of the great builder Calasandur. Our brethren in the Redglades march out alongside the armies of Lorent like some pitiful puppy, yipping and bouncing about at its master's heels. And how long shall it be until the Gawedi savages burn the white harbor of Celmaldor? Who, save for scholars, know the name Varivar?\n\nLet us resolve to build upon what we have, not to grow complacent as others did. This day, we resolve to create a homeland worthy of our people's glory. No more shall those cackling jaybirds in Anbennar speak of some inevitable irrelevance of elfkind.* | <li>north ibevar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>south ibevar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ibevar_prosperous_ibevar for 100 years</li><li>If whistlevale area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If cursewood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If rotwall area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If teagansfield area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [New Faith](#A32_new_faith)<br />[Council Of The Ancients](#A32_council_of_the_ancients)<br />[Secure the Succession](#A32_secure_the_succession)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_protecting_the_pass">Protecting The Pass</a><br />*While the Dwarves have surely made many cultural contributions to Cannor, and are one of the few among Halann's peoples who can even come close to matching the lifetime of an elf… We cannot count the tunnels they shaped through the Havoral Divide among their great works. With the impossibility of plugging the cheesecloth they'd turned the range into in that area, it's imperative we fortify our side of the Oldpassage, that we need not worry about invaders having a direct path to the heart of Ibevar.* | <li>356:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>356:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ibevar_the_western_wall</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Prosperous Ibevar](#A32_prosperous_ibevar)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_the_elven_vale">The Elven Vale</a><br />*What our Grand Prince swore, in looking upon the work that had been done to win Ibevar her renewed prosperity some years ago has finally been accomplished. The Elfrealm of Ibevar now stretches to the natural borders of our region, encompassing the great stretch of forest that makes up our home up through the Cursewood, and some rightfully claimed borderlands besides. Once more, it comes time to turn ourselves inward, for a period of self-reflection and development that shall see our realm ascend to new heights.* | <li>forlorn vale region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_the_elven_vale until otherwise removed</li> | [Protecting The Pass](#A32_protecting_the_pass)<br />[Expanding East](#A32_expanding_east)<br />[Securing The South](#A32_securing_the_south)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_safe_home">Safe Home</a><br />*Thanks to the input of the Council of Elders, and the rise of fresh blood in the positions many of them left behind, we've found the most optimal ways in which to develop the homeland of our people. We have revitalized our system of taxation and spending, eliminating the sort of atrophied pork-barrel spending that the centuries bring. We invested in our merchants and craftspeople, created innovative technologies and techniques to ensure we produce not only the finest goods, but an ample supply.\n\nFurthermore, through financial incentives, supportive legislation, and the dissemination of propaganda and rhetoric that stirs fear of the decline of our kind, we've increased the available supply of manpower. Our new systems of education have our nation teeming with a new generation of elves eager to defend the borders of their homeland, lest it fade as its rivals did.* | <li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 500</li><li>has elven majority trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add splendor = 800</li> | [The Elven Vale](#A32_the_elven_vale)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_casna_aesa">Casna Aesa</a><br />*Too much of our ruler and cabinet's time is wasted in long carriage rides, ferrying them between the many administrative offices scattered throughout Ibevar proper, as well as more distant centers of our nation's governance and function, such as the Blaíddscal or Antirionn. It's time that we end this troublesome redundancy, and centralize all matters of administrative function in one location.\n\nWhile we'll still maintain the larger institutions in their original places, relocating smaller endeavors, or the pertinent personnel who spend more time in our capital than not to a single complex should make the function of our nation much less troublesome for everyone involved. Casna Aesa shall shine as a bright reflection of Munas' court above, gathering the greatest among living elves to our court, just as the greatest of our fallen reside in his.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>treasury is at least 1500</li> | <li>the event [The Three Branches of Casna Aesa](../events/the_three_branches_of_casna_aesa.md) happens</li> | [Safe Home](#A32_safe_home)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_ibevari_expansion">Ibevari Expansion</a><br />*While the reclamation of rightful elven territory in Farranéan, Casnamóine, and other surrounding areas has been a great boon for Ibevar, we would do well to continue in growing our state. We've long heard whispers of how Arbaran's rulers have jealously eyed our lands, the Silcalas, so far fallen from the architectural genius of their predecessor, fancying that they should strip our sovereignty and place us under the thrall of some human on Anbennar's throne. As if!\n\nThe rapscallions and brigands who went to fight the greentide have produced a most vile strain of ruler, these Witch-Kings squabbling as to who might best inherit the tyranny of Black Castanor. Out of respect for Adean, surely we could see that our benevolent and level-headed rule might see his namesake's lands would be inhabited by civilized folk. It's time we muster arms once more, and ward ourselves from these threats.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>army size percentage is at least 0.75</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>If arbaran area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If cestir area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If golden plains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If rohibon area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If valefort area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If verteben area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If taran plains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Ibevari Soldier](#A32_ibevari_soldier)<br />[Casna Aesa](#A32_casna_aesa)<br />[Ibevari Diplomat](#A32_ibevari_diplomat)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_greater_ibevar">Greater Ibevar</a><br />*Finally, we've created an Elfrealm to rival the dreams of those who first landed upon our shores. We're nowhere near as foolhardy as Ioriel or Jaherion, whether it would come to diluting our blood and cultivating some pet line of human bastards, or overextending ourselves far beyond what we could possibly hold for more than some paltry few decades. Rather than the silver-blooded nobles of Anbennar, Ibevar shall be a realm of truesilver, the finest, purest incarnation of elven culture.\n\nWith the lasting prosperity of our core lands, the few proud elfrealms that still stand independent, as well as those who have been subjugated by a human's crown look to us for guidance, and many among them have even fled to our realm. The new Greater Ibevar stands ascendant, ready to chart its course into our future, to whatever goal we set. Might we take the Cursewoods from the barbarians who slew Ianren? Unseat the Witch-Kings of Escann? Seize the throne of Anbennar for ourselves? Infinite possibilities await in this new Silver Age that has dawned upon all of Cannor.* | <li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is province_is_prosperous</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>development is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Elfrealm of Greater Ibevar](../events/elfrealm_of_greater_ibevar.md) happens</li> | [Elfrealm Of The North](#A32_elfrealm_of_the_north)<br />[Elfrealm Of The East](#A32_elfrealm_of_the_east)<br /> |

| <a name="A32_religious_integration">Religious Integration</a><br />*Long have we pondered how we might help our people see the truth of Cannor's gods, and cease their moping about the death of the gods. While the other elfreams have long since adopted the Regent Court, Ibevar has been slower to believe in their gods. But, we may finally have a solution.\n\nErelas Starwatcher, a brilliant rhetor and theologian has come to our king, offering a syncretic path between our tradition of venerating elven elders, and the worship of the Regent Court. He would have us proclaim that Munas Moonsinger is the patron of all elves, and our ancestors have joined his court in the stars above.\n\nWith this profound concept, this thunderous theology, we might finally hold the power to sway our people, and create traditions that might ease the burden our faith has brought to diplomacy with the rest of Cannor.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>is year is at least 1448</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_religious_integration for 25 years</li> | [Secure the Succession](#A32_secure_the_succession)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_with_the_court">With The Court</a><br />*The tide is turning, and quickly at that. Prior to our efforts to convert our people, belief in the Regent Court was only held by a sparse few. Mostly our diplomatic elite, or those who had spent time abroad. The only other stronghold resided with our human subjects in Téinmas, which Asheniande was forced to release to us as a buffer as reparation for the Moon Party's incursion into our realm.\n\nNow, though? The symbols of the pantheon, the Dame's moon, bows of Falah, and all the rest have joined the little Lunatéins, symbols of the Remnant Fleet ship captained by the line of our Prince, from which Munas led our people to Cannor. From the sensual delights of Minaran festivals, to lectures on how Balgar's techniques influenced the architecture of our cities, we're striving to show how the Court has, and can continue to brighten the lives of our people.* | <li>religious unity is at least 0.5</li><li>is not at war</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add prestige = 5</li> | [Religious Integration](#A32_religious_integration)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_new_faith">New Faith</a><br />*While the priesthood of Nerat has been less than happy about Munas' intrusion upon the domain of their god, Cannor has always held certain regional differences, when it comes to theology. Thanks to the influence of our people, and the increased prominence of elves in the priesthoods of Munas and the Dame, the notion that Munas Moonsinger has ascended to be the patron of all elves has become increasingly popular.\n\nHis rising tide is even beginning to lift the prominence of those singular gods of other races, such as Balgar and Begga Goodfingers. With the stars gleaming above, the souls of our forebears smile down upon us from their place alongside Munas. We shall look to the stars, to our forebears for guidance as he once did.* | <li>religious unity is at least 1</li><li>is not at war</li> | <li>custom tooltip = ibevar_new_faith_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [ibevar_new_faith](../flags/ibevar_new_faith.md)</li></ul><li>the event [Making Our Choice.](../events/making_our_choice.md) happens</li> | [To The New With The Old](#A32_to_the_new_with_the_old)<br /> |

And more conveniently, not enough of a threat to have put us on the back foot during our skirmishes in the Lilac Wars. It's time we put these knights of the Empire to better use than Anbennar has done so far. Or we could simply expel them. After all, Tombsvale, despite that grim name, does have some lovely woodland that would suit our elves far better than the Aldresians.\n\nSurely we can find some documents that prove it was rightfully elven land that they resettled. Who among them could remember otherwise? For it has been quite a few human lifetimes since Aldresia's crusade against the White Pestilence, and the undead horrors that it brought upon our serene realm.* | <li>rotwall area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 50</li><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_securing_the_south until otherwise removed</li> | [Prosperous Ibevar](#A32_prosperous_ibevar)<br /> |

Even with all we've done to solidify our position in the world, the hungry eyes of Anbennar's rulers may well still be our greatest threat.\n\nIt is more than essential that we either endear ourselves, and see that the emperor remains our friend and ally, or that we put them between a rock and a hard place. After all, considering how easily Lorent was able to fracture the Empire, make a mockery of the name "Unity" during the Lilac Wars, and turn Dameria's friends to enemies, who's to say we can't do the same to them once more?* | <li>is not at war</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>exists</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is rival is this nation</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>Country is Ibevar</li></ul></ul></ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>num of allies is at least 3</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is part of hre</li></ul></ul></ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>Country is Ibevar</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = 150</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_diplomatic_security until otherwise removed</li> | [Safe Home](#A32_safe_home)<br /> |

A wise web of alliances would make a better tool than all the arms and armor our greatest minds could muster in preventing the untimely deaths of our soldiers. Why should we waste our time with their wars, when those fickle-minded humans are of the sort to war over something as inconsequential as a bucket?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of allies is at least 4</li><li>num of subjects is at least 2</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 350</li></ul> | <li>If has num of allies is 4, and has num of subjects is 2:</li><ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -350</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier ibevari_external_diplomacy until otherwise removed</li> | [Diplomatic Security](#A32_diplomatic_security)<br /> |
| <a name="A32_ibevari_diplomat">Ibevari Diplomat</a><br />*While perhaps lacking such distinctive flairs as fast-talking Derwingers or the striking exoticism of the Jaddarin harpies, our diplomats nonetheless retain a distinctly Ibevari air of refinement and majesty. And moreover, these diplomats have been thoroughly instructed on how to let loose while retaining their faculties. Despite the stereotypes for elven constitution, our diplomats are often second only to Minara’s Exalted Companions in their ability to hold drink, and their tongue beyond it. With their keen elven ears, our fine folk will soak up those slurred secrets like sponges unto themselves, and see that no plot of Cannor’s elite will escape our notice.\n\nOur diplomats will remain in high demand as we ensure that the most outgoing and eager orators of our growing generations are diverted into the service of the pen. Consulting with the foremost in courtly mannerisms, employing the finest tailors of Núrael, clad in the shining gems of Carodir’s Pass, and armed with bottles of Varillen’s renowned glowing wine, our diplomats are truly the finest. Just as the infusion of magic into that Varilleni can shift the profile of its flavor to suit the tongue it lands upon, so shift their tongues. Just as the Varilleni's glow has brought it to renown all across Cannor, so too glows the renown of our silver-tongued diplomats.* | <li>diplomatic reputation is at least 6</li> | <li>country gets the modifier ibevar_the_ibevari_diplomat until otherwise removed</li> | [External Diplomacy](#A32_external_diplomacy)<br />[Internal Preparations](#A32_internal_preparation)<br /> |

Then they were replaced in turn by slavers, bandits, every sort of ill-mannered folk, arguably even more savage than the orcs they had slain. And, worse yet, as they came to create their own nations, these squabbling realms have been ruled by tyrants who flout the Magisterium's laws, and practice all sorts of hideous rituals.\n\nWhile most of our kin prefer the woodlands, at the heart of our kingdom, many have already taken to the open grasslands of the north, and those in the old Farrani lands. We'll take the fallow plain of that old kingdom under our own wing, and see that upstanding, chivalrous elves might embody those long-absent virtues in its stead.* | <li>verteben area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>valefort area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>rohibon area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>taran plains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li> | [Ibevari Expansion](#A32_ibevari_expansion)<br /> |

Further discussion has brought to the forefront the idea of creating a great temple in our capital, dedicated to Munas and the Dame, showing how she lifted him to the stars upon his death, set him in place as the patron of all elves.* | <li>religious unity is at least 0.4</li><li>treasury is at least 350</li><li>capital is at least 352</li> | <li>add treasury = -350</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ibevar_temple_construction</li><li>duration = 1825</li></ul></ul> | [Religious Integration](#A32_religious_integration)<br /> |

Our finest artisans have spent years casting in marble the tale of our flight from Aelantir, and the Dame's role in guiding Munas and the Remnant Fleet to Cannor. Now, as they ascend the spiraling stairs of our great temple, even the illiterate can see plain as day how our people owe their lives to the Regent Court, to the Dame's mercy.\n\nFrom our ships beneath the billowing smoke of the Day of Ashen Skies, to the Lunatéin's grounding in Anbenncóst's harbor, our exodus shall remain forevermore in the memory of Ibevar's people. As they look upon the temple's massive doors, the centerpiece of the temple unfolds. A relief of Munas and the Dame, her arm stretching from the heavens, his own fingers striving to meet it as he gazes skyward from the crow's nest of the Lunatéin.* | <li>religious unity is at least 0.75</li><li>capital is at least 352</li><li>352:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ibevar_temple_construction</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 75</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add adm power = -75</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ibevar_great_temple</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A New Temple](#A32_a_new_temple)<br /> |

While perhaps not so relevant to politics as the capital at Ibevar, or as well-lubricated as the vineyards of Varillen, it serves as the perfect social atmosphere to educate our diplomats.\n\nNestled betwixt our capital and Antirionn, the city at rivers' meet shall serve as the Blaíddscal of our diplomatic corps. Through training in all aspects of social conduct drilled as harshly as our soldiers' fire and formation, the careful cultivation of a captivating sense of aesthetics, we shall create Cannor's foremost socialites.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>stability is at least 2</li><li>diplomat is at least 3</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier ibevar_internal_preparation until otherwise removed</li> | [Diplomatic Security](#A32_diplomatic_security)<br /> |
