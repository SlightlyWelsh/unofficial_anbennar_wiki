| <a name="konwell_invite_dwarves">Dwarven Instructors</a><br />*Dwarves are well known throughout Cannor as master engineers and builders. If we can find a way to permanently entice a few of them to our lands as lecturers and professors, generations of future Konwellian students will benefit.* | <li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>trade goods is copper</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>trade goods is gold</li></ul><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_dwarves_invited for 20 years</li><li>275:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Institute Investment](#konwell_institute_investment)<br /> |
| <a name="konwell_invite_gnomes">Gnomish Professors</a><br />*Crafty, ingenious, and impulsively experimental, gnomes are at the forefront of many technological wonders and innovations. If we can prove our institute their equal in thought and resources, we may be able to sponsor some gnomes to teach our students in exchange.* | <li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is gnomish</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Rule Britannia"</li></ul><li>innovativeness is at least 20</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_gnomes_invited for 20 years</li><li>country gets the modifier innovation_wave for 20 years</li><li>If does not have dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>add mil power = -150</li></ul><li>275:</li><ul><li>add gnomish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>medium increase of gnomish tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Dwarven Instructors](#konwell_invite_dwarves)<br /> |
| <a name="konwell_build_new_wing">Dedicate New Wing</a><br />*The Konwell Institute is rapidly expanding under our control and with our investments. Now is the time to expand our facilities and build an entire new wing! We will be able to choose the guidance of our new dwarven and gnomish instructors, dedicating the new wing to artificery, or we can ask the guidance of the elves, focusing on the theory and application of either transmutation or divination magic.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>275:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction building</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_started_institute_wing for 20 years</li><li>the event [Expand the Konwell Institute](../events/expand_the_konwell_institute.md) happens</li><li>custom tooltip = konwell_build_new_wing_effect</li> | [Gnomish Professors](#konwell_invite_gnomes)<br />[Elven Educators](#konwell_invite_elves)<br /> |
| <a name="konwell_exchange_program">An Exchange Program</a><br />*Though we personally believe that the Institute is the greatest school in all of Cannor, we are also humble enough to acknowledge that the Anbenncóst school are our superiors in many important fields such as magic. If we can establish a student exchange program with them, we can send our most promising students to learn all they can from them before reentering our fold.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>owns core province 8</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 8</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -50</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier konwell_tech_cost for 10 years</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = court_mage</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = naval_reformer</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = army_reformer</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [Dedicate New Wing](#konwell_build_new_wing)<br /> |

| <a name="konwell_institute_investment">Institute Investment</a><br />*The Konwell Institute is one of the oldest and prestigious schools in Cannor. Unlike the more well known Silmuna School and Imperial Academy of Anbenncóst, which focused primarily on magic and secondarily in other fields, the Institute carved out a niche specializing in other aspects of education and learning, while having an important magical contingent in its own right. We must invest heavily in the Institute, making it the premier school in all of Cannor!* | <li>275:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li></ul> | <li>change innovativeness = 5</li><li>If does not have dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier konwell_tech_cost for 20 years</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = konwell_advisors_effect</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>random list:</li><ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = philosopher</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul></ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = natural_scientist</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul></ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = artist</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul></ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = treasurer</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul></ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = theologian</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul></ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = master_of_mint</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="konwell_dewey_decimal">Konwellian Classification</a><br />*The Imperial Archives are filled with innumerable secluded alcoves towering shelves records, and books stacked high. Through the generations, master archivers and scholars have sorted and resorted the archives based on their own whims and needs at the time. To those new to the archives, dredging through the archives is akin to picking out a particularly grey rock out of a field of hundreds of grey rocks. Constructing and developing a standardized, accessible system of organization can only help out our scholars and any who use the archives.* | <li>adm is at least 5</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_idea_cost for 10 years</li><li>add adm power = -50</li> | [Institute Investment](#konwell_institute_investment)<br /> |
| <a name="konwell_invite_elves">Elven Educators</a><br />*With their long lifespans and sharp minds, elves are some of the most magically gifted and knowledgeable mages and scholars in Cannor. Unfortunately for us, many also tend to be quite proud. If we can improve our own standing in their eyes and invest in the proper accommodations for them, we may be able to draw some out into the employ of the Institute.* | <li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is elven</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul><li>prestige is at least 40</li> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_elves_invited for 20 years</li><li>275:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>medium increase of elven tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Dwarven Instructors](#konwell_invite_dwarves)<br /> |

| <a name="konwell_host_the_ravelian_society">The Ravelian Society</a><br />*The conflict between Adean and Corin has brought the continent to its knees, either by fanatical zeal or decadent apathy. The Ravelian Society, however, seems to be a voice of reason amidst this age of upheaval. They are a group of scholars who seek to view the world through the lens of reason, so it is no surprise that many within the Konwell Institute have already made themselves acquainted with such a promising group of intellectuals.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>275:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ravelian_society</li><li>has province modifier  ravelian_lodge</li></ul></ul><li>religion is ravelian</li></ul> | <li>If has 275 has province modifier is ravelian society:</li><ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>275:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = ravelian_society</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravelian_lodge</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has 275 has province modifier is ravelian lodge:</li><ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li></ul> | [Konwell Institute Press](#konwell_form_institute_press)<br /> |
| <a name="konwell_question_of_faith">A Question of Faith</a><br />*The empire is at a great crossroads of belief. With one of the largest printing presses in the empire at the Konwell Institute, we have the God-given obligation to spread the truth across the disparate masses. The Ravelian faith is the only way to the future, and we must ensure any and all have that choice to free themselves from the shackles of the past.* | <li>religion is ravelian</li> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_ravelian_publications for 20 years</li> | [The Ravelian Society](#konwell_host_the_ravelian_society)<br /> |
| <a name="konwell_establish_university_league">A New League of Universities</a><br />*The exchange program has paid dividends over the years, with both our and Anbenncóst schools benefiting from the exchange in students and knowledge. Maybe it is time to codify our agreement into something bigger, something more official, something grander. Let us establish the foremost educational league in all Cannor!* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has building university</li></ul><li>8:</li><ul><li>has building university</li></ul><li>275:</li><ul><li>has building university</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>the event [A New League of Universities](../events/a_new_league_of_universities.md) happens</li> | [An Exchange Program](#konwell_exchange_program)<br /> |

| <a name="konwell_paper_production">Raw Paper Production</a><br />*Paper-making in Cannor is a complicated and expensive process. Lacking easy access to Raheni cotton, flax cloth and linen were the primary raw materials and required heavy processing. Let us fire up the old mills of Millsbay to feed the ravenous demands of Konwell.* | <li>905:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li> | <li>905:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = cloth</li><li>If does not have building is textile:</li><ul><li>add building = textile</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -300</li> |  |
| <a name="konwell_master_scholar">Patronize Master Scholar</a><br />*The Konwell Institute has produced many master scholars over the years. Making a habit of patronizing a few of them will expose our nation and ruler to new ideas and ways of looking at things that would be missed by other countries, to our benefit.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>natural scientist is at least 2</li><li>artist is at least 2</li><li>philosopher is at least 2</li></ul><li>has institution renaissance</li> | <li>change innovativeness = 5</li><li>If does not have dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier konwell_tech_cost for 20 years</li></ul> | [Raw Paper Production](#konwell_paper_production)<br /> |
| <a name="konwell_form_institute_press">Konwell Institute Press</a><br />*The printing revolution has begun, and Konwell must be at the forefront! Many others do not yet see the potential of this new device, but our scholars see it as a vehicle to spread our ideas and our influence across Cannor. We must pour investment developing our own press at the Institute.* | <li>275:</li><ul><li>printing press is at least 100</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_institute_press until otherwise removed</li><li>add treasury = -300</li> | [Patronize Master Scholar](#konwell_master_scholar)<br /> |

| <a name="konwell_expand_imperial_archives">Expand the Archives</a><br />*Though the Imperial Archives were meant to hold beyond the builders’ imaginations, the strain of years of records and manuscripts placed upon it by the Empire’s administrative needs have pushed it close to bursting. An untimely fire could cause the whole thing to go up in flames! Surely, expanding the archives will earn the praise and appreciation of the emperor and electors who use it most.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier konwell_archives_expanded for 20 years</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>modifier = konwell_archives_expanded_opinion</li></ul></ul><li>every elector:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>modifier = konwell_archives_expanded_opinion</li></ul></ul> |  |

| <a name="konwell_konwell_education">Institute Educated</a><br />*The focus on the Institute has established Konwell one of  the greatest centers of learning in the empire. Our own sons and daughters are great beneficiaries of our system of education, and are among the most learned wherever they go. [Root.Heir.GetName] has limitless potential indeed, equipped with the basis of a Konwellion education.* | <li>heir age is at least 10</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is konwell_magical_heir_trigger</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has heir flag [heir_consort_mage_personality](../flags/heir_consort_mage_personality.md)</li><li>heir has mage personality is yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = konwell_magical_heir_effect</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>increase heir adm effect = yes</li><li>increase heir dip effect = yes</li><li>increase heir mil effect = yes</li></ul> | [Establish Clerical Class](#konwell_clerical_class)<br />[A New League of Universities](#konwell_establish_university_league)<br /> |

The greatest resource we have, however, is our ownership of the Imperial Archive. The knowledge of generations, upon our very doorstep, is a powerful advantage for those familiar with spending their nights illuminated by flickering candleglow. And indeed, that is how [Root.Monarch.GetName] spent much of their childhood. Aided by the insight gifted by an innate sensitivity to divination, the myriad secrets and lore hidden by the Archives are [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s to use as they see fit.* | <li>ruler has mage personality is yes</li><li>ruler age is at least 30</li> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Missing localisation: konwell_16_t](../events/missing_localisation_konwell_16_t.md) happens</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = konwell_loreseeker_effect</li><li>set ruler flag [ruler_studying_legend_lore](../flags/ruler_studying_legend_lore.md)</li> | [Institute Educated](#konwell_konwell_education)<br /> |

| <a name="konwell_scholar_kings">Rule of the Scholar-Kings</a><br />*'The path to a successful reign lies in enlightenment and learning, for the mistakes of the past are ours to study.' Buoyed by the Institute and culture of learning in Konwell, every Scholar-King turns out a keen learner and talented administrator. And if not, capable and loyal Institute alumni will inevitably pick up the slack.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is konwell_scholar_kings_trigger</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 5</li><li>dip is at least 5</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 5</li><li>mil is at least 5</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>dip is at least 5</li><li>mil is at least 5</li></ul></ul></ul><li>ruler has mage personality is yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier konwell_writing_magical_treatise</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier konwell_scholar_kings until otherwise removed</li> | [Treatise on Magical Study](#konwell_magical_treatise)<br /> |

Perhaps we can offer to take on some of their administrative duties out of the pure goodness of our hearts? \n\n§YNOTE:§!
