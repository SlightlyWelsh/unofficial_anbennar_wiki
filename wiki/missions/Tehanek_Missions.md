| <a name="G40_glimpse_beyond">Glimpse Beyond</a><br />*We have dreamed. We have journeyed far. We have caught a glimpse of the world’s true face--and we have discovered that there is far more to be seen.\n\nIf we wish to find the deeper secrets of the dobondotim, to map the Dance of Dreams and achieve ultimate knowledge, then we shall need to harness the Eshtikwia, the ‘Sky Road’.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is dotim_dream_of_the_world_above_tt</li><li>has country flag [dotim_unlocked_winged_beast](../flags/dotim_unlocked_winged_beast.md)</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is dotim_dream_of_all_things_tt</li><li>has country flag [dotim_unlocked_colour_of_all_things](../flags/dotim_unlocked_colour_of_all_things.md)</li></ul> | <li>If random province has tribal land of is ROOT, and has owns core province is THIS:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = tehanek_site_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>save global event target as = tehanek_site</li></ul></ul><li>set country flag [tehanek_province_chosen](../flags/tehanek_province_chosen.md)</li> | [The First Council](#G40_the_first_council)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_seeking_deeper_knowledge">Deeper Knowledge</a><br />*We have journeyed far. We have discovered much. The World Above, the Sky, connects all that is, all that was, and all that shall be -- if only we could see as the Dream does!\n\nBut there is a path to this knowledge, glimmering just beyond the horizon, revealed by the gaze of the Winged Beast and the hidden truths of the ever-shifting Colour of Space. From the great heights of the clouds and stars, we have found our Road to the Sky imprinted upon the land below. The Winged Primordial, keeper of all knowledge, awaits us!* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has country flag [tehanek_province_chosen](../flags/tehanek_province_chosen.md)</li></ul><li>event target:tehanek site:</li><ul><li>development discounting tribal is at least 10</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>manpower is at least 0.1</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add manpower = -0.1</li><li>event target:tehanek site:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = tehanek_site_1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = tehanek_site_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Glimpse Beyond](#G40_glimpse_beyond)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_prepare_the_site">Prepare the Site</a><br />*We have discovered much. We have seen wonders. The Sky Road has been found--now we need only use it.\n\nOur shamans and Shapers have devised a ritual for just such a purpose, and while the preparations will take many years, it will be well worth the effort.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>court mage is at least 2</li><li>ruler has mage personality is yes</li></ul> | <li>event target:tehanek site:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = tehanek_prepare_site</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Deeper Knowledge](#G40_seeking_deeper_knowledge)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_a_fragment_of_power">A Fragment of Power</a><br />*We have seen wonders. We have seen terrors. We have been hounded at every turn by those who would keep us from true knowledge--and we have overcome them!\n\nNow, the Eshkitwia has led us to a cache of ancient and powerful artifacts, perfect for shaping the greatest dobontim Tehanek has ever seen! With this, we shall surely find the knowledge we seek and be able to map the Hohldihla in its entirety!* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has country flag [tehanek_province_chosen](../flags/tehanek_province_chosen.md)</li></ul><li>event target:tehanek site:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier tehanek_prepare_site</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is dotim_dream_of_reshaping_tt</li><li>has country flag [dotim_unlocked_beast_of_stone](../flags/dotim_unlocked_beast_of_stone.md)</li></ul><li>church power is at least 100</li> | <li>add church power = -100</li><li>event target:tehanek site:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = precursor_relics</li><li>set add relics count = yes</li></ul><li>clr country flag [tehanek_province_chosen](../flags/tehanek_province_chosen.md)</li><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_lost_knowledge for 20 years</li> | [Prepare the Site](#G40_prepare_the_site)<br /> |

| <a name="G40_the_first_council">The First Council</a><br />*The shamans and World Shapers of Tehanek have always been blessed by a deep connection to the Hohldihla, the Dance of Dreams, a door into the world of the Great Aspects. But our most recent Hohldihla have revealed secrets beyond all Dreams before them--secrets of the past, the future, and the land over which our souls fly in the Dance. Let us light a great council fire, that we may summon together the wisest of our people for contemplation and discussion of this new knowledge.* | <li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is ADM</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is DIP</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is MIL</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has native migration government yes</li></ul><li>native ceremonial fire pit is at least 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>stability is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_first_council for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G40_the_knowledge_of_others">Knowledge of Others</a><br />*The Yanek are both our closest brothers and our most common rivals. They live very different lives, forever cowering in their tree-homes, more concerned with survival in the moment than in gathering knowledge for the future, but their perspective may be of value to us precisely because it is so strange. When the time for raiding comes once again, let us take what we can from their treehouses to enhance our own vision.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Yanek</li></ul><li>G04:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Yanek</li></ul></ul> | <li>add church power = 50</li> | [The First Council](#G40_the_first_council)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_the_second_council">The Second Council</a><br />*We have been unwise. For so long have we stood aloof from our Boek brothers, while those beyond the Sea have increased in number and steeped themselves in secrets we have only begun to unravel. No longer! Our second great council shall be a meeting not only of our finest minds, but of all the Boek peoples, bringing forth knowledge and ideas that have heretofore been unknown to us, and shaping a new path forward.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>culture is boek</li></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>culture is boek</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>government is native</li></ul> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The First Council of Mage-Shamans](../events/the_first_council_of_mage_shamans.md) happens</li></ul><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_second_council for 15 years</li><li>If every known country has culture is boek, and  has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 100:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_second_council for 15 years</li></ul></ul> | [Knowledge of Others](#G40_the_knowledge_of_others)<br />[The Arrival](#G40_the_arrival)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_the_mages_proposal">The Mages’ Proposal</a><br />*The Mages have a long-standing tradition of electing the chief of Tehanek along with the other elders of the tribe, however with our new ways bearing fruit they have come forth with a proposal that new leaders should be chosen solely by the mages, and naturally from their own ranks.\n\nThe mage-shamans have always had the closest connection to the Dance of Dreams, and thus to our greater goals, and so it would behoove us to accept their request.* | <li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_mages_organization_state</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>government is native</li></ul> | <li>If does not have government is theocracy:</li><ul><li>change government = theocracy</li></ul><li>add government reform = tehanek_magocracy_reform</li><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_opposition until otherwise removed</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has mission completed is G40 the red eagle:</li><ul><li>the event [The Red Eagle Rebellion](../events/the_red_eagle_rebellion.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [The Second Council](#G40_the_second_council)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_the_aspect_of_knowledge">The Aspect of Knowledge</a><br />*We have seen terrors. We have found wisdom. We have discovered every secret of the Dance--but for one.\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stands ready to follow the path to its conclusion and consult the Winged Primordial directly, to take into themselves the Aspect of All Knowledge. Divination magic famously deals in expanding the mind and absorbing a breadth and depth of information that well exceeds normal mortal limits, and [Root.Monarch.GetName] is a true master of the art. Thus, we hope that their mind will be able to contain the Aspect and truly harness its power. Despite our preparations, it will be a dangerous endeavor. But we are willing to pay the price, for the reward is worth any risk.\n\nNow, our Knowledge shall truly be unmatched!* | <li>unlocked all tier 2 dotim aspects is yes</li><li>ruler is legendary in divination</li> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [In Search of Knowledge](../events/in_search_of_knowledge.md) happens</li></ul><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = dotim_unlock_primordial_wings_tt</li><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_aspect_of_knowledge until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [A Fragment of Power](#G40_a_fragment_of_power)<br />[Fell the Winged](#G40_fell_the_winged)<br /> |

| <a name="G40_the_arrival">The Arrival</a><br />*There is something new in the Dance. It seems that the Aspects have led people from beyond the Sea to our shores. Perhaps their presence is a sign of fortune, or perhaps an ill omen. Let us meet them, and we shall see which they are.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is year is at least 1600</li></ul></ul><li>trollsbay region:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>culture is not ruinborn is yes</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>is year is at least 1600</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier tehanek_making_contact for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G40_studying_the_invaders">Study the Invaders</a><br />*The Sea Peoples, who call themselves ‘Cannorians’, have knowledge beyond our wildest dreams! We had thought the Yanek were strange and full of untapped perspectives, but now we see that they are practically Tehaneki themselves compared to these foreigners!\n\nWe must know what the Cannorians know, both for the advancement of our knowledge and for our own protection, for it seems that not all of their tribes are friends of the Boek, and they are armed with weapons reminiscent of those of the designs of Reshaper, seen in the furthest reaches of the Dance of Dreams.* | <li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture is not ruinborn is yes</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier tehanek_studying_settlers for 15 years</li> | [The Arrival](#G40_the_arrival)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_unity_in_the_east">Unity in the East</a><br />*Tehanek is far greater than it was in the days before the Cannorians came, both in size and in knowledge, but we, like all Boek, face great dangers as well. It is finally time to bring our brothers East of the Inn under our wings for our mutual protection, and to unite our peoples in wisdom and harmony.* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>num of provinces in states is at least 10</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_eastern_unity for 50 years</li><li>If has exists is G04:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = G04</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [Study the Invaders](#G40_studying_the_invaders)<br /> |
| <a name="G40_fell_the_winged">Fell the Winged</a><br />*The Red Eagles have been crushed at last, returned to their proper place! So too has the Winged Beast fallen, torn from the heavens and imprisoned once more within its stony carapace! Finally, these thorns both physical and spiritual have been removed from our sides, and we can move forward unhindered by those who would drag us back into the past!* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [red_eagle_won](../flags/red_eagle_won.md)</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tehanek_crush_rebels_tt</li><li>has country flag [red_eagle_rose_up](../flags/red_eagle_rose_up.md)</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of rebel armies is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>num of rebel controlled provinces is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>mil power is at least 300</li></ul><li>has church aspect winged_beast</li> | <li>If has country flag is [red_eagle_won](../flags/red_eagle_won.md):</li><ul><li>add mil power = -300</li></ul><li>the event [Clipping the Winged Beast](../events/clipping_the_winged_beast.md) happens</li><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_forbidden_knowledge for 20 years</li> | [The Mages’ Proposal](#G40_the_mages_proposal)<br />[Unity in the East](#G40_unity_in_the_east)<br />[The Red Eagle](#G40_the_red_eagle)<br /> |

If our shamans should, over the course of their visit, persuade their ambassadors to make certain ‘minor concessions’ and acknowledge our obvious natural borders, then all the better!

| <a name="G40_the_red_eagle">The Red Eagle</a><br />*It is clear to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] that if we are to control our lands we must push back the invaders, and the best way to do this is to take our greatest warriors and imbue them with the powers of the Eagle Spirit.\n\nThe Hewehr'ittaro is the first among our warriors, and he will lead the Red Eagles to victory. It is likewise the best way for us to keep an eye on him, for he is also a vocal opponent of the mage-shamans…* | <li>backwoods area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>define general:</li><ul><li>fire = 1</li><li>shock = 6</li><li>manuever = 6</li><li>siege = 0</li><li>name = "Hewehr'ittaro"</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier tehanek_red_eagle_mantle for 10 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has mission completed is G40 the mages proposal:</li><ul><li>the event [The Red Eagle Rebellion](../events/the_red_eagle_rebellion.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [Negotiating" Borders](#G40_negotiating_borders)<br /> |
