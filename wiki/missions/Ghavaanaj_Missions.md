| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_gather_skilled_mahouts">Gather Skilled Mahouts</a><br />*Since our earliest days, we have tamed elephants, and over the course of time, we have learned the best ways to do so. Those who tame them are known as mahouts, and they begin their training as a child. Throughout Rahen, mahouts rear elephants, but most of them use cruel methods, driving sharp metal tools into their hides to force them to move.\n\nOur mahouts, however, treat our elephants with respect, and as such, they are willing to do anything for us. Let us assemble our best under a single general, to make our enemies shudder as we charge.* | <li>has leader with:</li><ul><li>general is yes</li><li>shock is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_well_led_elephants for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_organise_elephant_training">Organise Elephant Training</a><br />*With our mahouts united under a single general, we should gather our forces and engage in a few training exercises. The mahouts are hoping to impress the Reeshi representatives that we have invited, in the hopes of collaborating directly with them.* | <li>num of cavalry is at least 4</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>If is controlled by the AI:</li><ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = ghavaanaj_elephant_herd_mechanic_unlocked_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [ghavaanaj_elephant_herd_mechanic](../flags/ghavaanaj_elephant_herd_mechanic.md)</li><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = ghavaanaj_max_herd_size</li><li>value = 4</li></ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = ghavaanaj_herd_size_counter</li><li>value = 0</li></ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = ghavaanaj_herd_training_counter</li><li>value = 0</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_herd_training_mental_00 until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_herd_training_physical_00 until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_herd_size_1 until otherwise removed</li><li>save global event target as = ghavaanaj_herd_country</li><li>random owned province:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = ghavaanaj_monthly_tick</li></ul><li>ghavaanaj update herd size provinces = yes</li></ul></ul> | [Gather Skilled Mahouts](#ghavaanaj_1_gather_skilled_mahouts)<br />[Maintain Reeshi Relations](#ghavaanaj_2_maintain_reeshi_relations)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_reeshi_bonds">Reeshi Bonds</a><br />*Our collaboration with the Reeshi has more than paid off, as they have assisted our already skilled mahouts in bonding with their elephants. Perhaps we should see about broadening the scope of their help and folding them into the training of both our mahouts and the noble elephants they raise.* | <li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [ghavaanaj_reeshi_bonds_flag](../flags/ghavaanaj_reeshi_bonds_flag.md)</li></ul><li>set estate privilege = estate_mages_reeshi_bonds</li> | [Organise Elephant Training](#ghavaanaj_1_organise_elephant_training)<br /> |

| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_merge_breeding_stock">Merge Breeding Stock</a><br />*We have the land of the other tribes within our domain, but they have, until now, done their best to prevent us from accessing their herds. With all the elephant Lords under our control, however, we have earned their grudging respect, and can make them supply us with some of their finest bulls.* | <li>owns core province 4469</li><li>owns core province  4479</li><li>owns core province   4508</li><li>owns core province    4486</li><li>owns core province     4477</li><li>owns core province      4483</li> | <li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = ghavaanaj_max_herd_size</li><li>value = 6</li></ul> | [Reeshi Bonds](#ghavaanaj_1_reeshi_bonds)<br />[Formalize Tribal Relations](#ghavaanaj_2_formalize_tribal_relations)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_refined_training">Refined Training</a><br />*With the secret techniques of the various tribes, we have a wide variety of training methods available for our companions. By codifying them into a single training regimen, we can build on the various strengths of each method, and speed up the overall process.* | <li>4469:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_white_herd_unlocked</li></ul><li>4479:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_red_herd_unlocked</li></ul><li>4508:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_purple_herd_unlocked</li></ul><li>4486:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_black_herd_unlocked</li></ul><li>4477:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_palace_herd_unlocked</li></ul><li>4483:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ghavaanaj_castle_herd_unlocked</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = ghavaanaj_1_refined_training_tt</li><li>set country flag [ghavaanaj_refined_training_flag](../flags/ghavaanaj_refined_training_flag.md)</li> | [Merge Breeding Stock](#ghavaanaj_1_merge_breeding_stock)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_expand_the_herd">Expand the Herd</a><br />*Our elephantry is the best in the world, but so far that has come at the cost of its size. With our new training regiments and the reconstruction of our war halls, we can begin to build up our herds to a size that will strike fear into those who would see us kneel again.* | <li>ghavaanaj has herd size 4 is yes</li> | <li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_widely_available_workforce for 20 years</li> | [Refined Training](#ghavaanaj_1_refined_training)<br />[War Halls](#ghavaanaj_2_war_halls)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_pachyderm_expertise">Pachyderm Expertise</a><br />*While ours is not the only army to field elephantry, we are unique in the fact that we are actually competent. We have little need of foot soldiers when our skills and speed give us the elephant of surprise.* | <li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is cavalry_power</li><li>value is at least 0.5</li></ul><li>government is monarchy</li> | <li>add government reform = pachyderm_masters</li> | [Expand the Herd](#ghavaanaj_1_expand_the_herd)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_champion_elephantine">Champion Elephantine</a><br />*We have at our command a truly mammoth and supremely skilled column of elephants, the best Haless has ever seen. Let us put on a grand display at [Root.Capital.GetName], so that all can see. With [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] at the head, we can strike boldly at the very souls of our rivals. For Dhujat! For [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]!* | <li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is cavalry_power</li><li>value is at least 0.6</li></ul><li>mil is at least 6</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>has ruler leader from this nation</li><li>cavalry in province is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_champion_elephantine</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul> | [Pachyderm Expertise](#ghavaanaj_1_pachyderm_expertise)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_1_pachyderm_mortars">Pachyderm Mortars</a><br />*When Ramaplar the Reunifier's heavy infantry decimated our troops, we were shown a glaring weakness that thus far we have struggled to overcome. Recent innovations in warfare, combined with a few mechanically minded mahouts have led to a proposal that may allow us to overcome that weakness.\n\nCannons are a devastating force multiplier on the field of battle, but they are very vulnerable. With some redesigns of our cannons, we can seize the elephant of surprise and use our mammoth allies as mobile artillery platforms to bring even the most elite infantry under our feet.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>trade goods is iron</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_pachyderm_mortars for 25 years</li> | [Lords of Tusk and Trunk](#ghavaanaj_2_lords_of_tusk_and_trunk)<br /> |

| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_maintain_reeshi_relations">Maintain Reeshi Relations</a><br />*While other nations employ mages, we benefit from the knowledge of the Reeshi, those who are skilled in magic because they know that they are a part of nature, not apart from it. Their ability to speak with animals allows them to form personal connections with animals, including elephants. We should ensure that we have their loyalty and aid them in whatever way they need.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_reeshi_aid for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_the_desert_tribes">The Desert Tribes</a><br />*In Eastern Dhujat, bordering the Marutha Desert, the Banjisbid and Ghavaghuundakhan tribes make their home. The differences in terrain have led to elephant-raising techniques that differ from the rest of the Ghavaanaji tribes. We should not forget that the two were once a part of the Black King's court, and make their lands ours.* | <li>maldeelakhan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture is ghavaanaj</li></ul><li>banjisbid area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture is ghavaanaj</li></ul><li>4461:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture is ghavaanaj</li></ul><li>4472:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>culture is ghavaanaj</li></ul> | <li>add army tradition = 10</li> | [Prepare the Elephants](#ghavaanaj_3_prepare_the_elephants)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_formalize_tribal_relations">Formalize Tribal Relations</a><br />*The Ghavaanaj have been organized into disparate tribes for a long time, rarely unified in purpose, and as such, we lack the organization and hierarchy that many similar states have. If we are to remain united, we must lay this groundwork while still respecting the relative independence of our subject tribes.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>government is monarchy</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add government reform = ghavaanaj_tribes</li> | [The Desert Tribes](#ghavaanaj_2_the_desert_tribes)<br />[The Small Tribes](#ghavaanaj_3_the_small_tribes)<br />[The Black Tribe](#ghavaanaj_4_the_black_tribe)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_harness_the_alliance">Harness the Alliance</a><br />*By bringing the tribes together and establishing the framework for their cooperation, we have freed up many resources that would previously have been used on intertribal squabbles.\n\nWithout each other to fight, many of the warriors are eager to serve our state. Further, by bringing these rival tribes together we have fostered a sense of unity, leading to a marked increase in volunteers, who, while unskilled, are ready to serve.* | <li>tribal allegiance is at least 40</li> | <li>add manpower = 10</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>cavalry = ROOT</li><li>cavalry = ROOT</li><li>cavalry = ROOT</li><li>cavalry = ROOT</li></ul> | [Formalize Tribal Relations](#ghavaanaj_2_formalize_tribal_relations)<br /> |

| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_war_halls">War Halls</a><br />*Traditional Ghavaanaji war halls are typically massive buildings, made of great blocks of sandstone and rammed earth, and located on the outskirts of towns, surrounded by the fields that feed the herds that stay there. We should build several war halls in our own style, rather than our conqueror's style, to impress our troops, house our elephantine allies, and boost recruitment.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>culture is ghavaanaj</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has building farm_estate</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = ghavaanaj_2_war_halls_tt</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>random owned province:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_war_hall</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is ghavaanaj, and  has manpower building trigger is yes, and  has building is farm estate:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ghavaanaj_war_hall</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Harness the Alliance](#ghavaanaj_2_harness_the_alliance)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_expand_grazing_grounds">Expand Grazing Grounds</a><br />*If we wish to be able to host a larger herd, we will need more relatively open and fertile land. Thankfully the Prabhia to our south are relatively weak, and we are as strong as a raging elephant.* | <li>satarsaya area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>tavharaan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province 4424</li> | <li>custom tooltip = ghavaanaj_2_expand_grazing_grounds_tt</li><li>set country flag [expanded_grazing_grounds_flag](../flags/expanded_grazing_grounds_flag.md)</li><li>If lower dhenbasana area does not have core is ROOT, and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If rhamirta area does not have core is ROOT, and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If inner rahen area does not have core is ROOT, and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If upper dhenbasana area does not have core is ROOT, and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south marutha area does not have core is ROOT, and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A New Black King](#ghavaanaj_3_a_new_black_king)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_trunks_in_the_dhenbasana">Trunks in the Dhenbasana</a><br />*With more grazing land in our domain, the ease with which we have taken it has caused many of our soldiers to call for opponents who are less soft, and suggest that perhaps we can reclaim our honour in the Dhenbasana, after our humiliation there before Ramaplar the Reunifier. When his heavy infantry encircled and captured our cavalry, we were forced to lay our crowns at his feet. Let us reclaim the site of this humiliation and use it to supply our herds, so we can turn the tables on the Lotus Claw.* | <li>lower dhenbasana area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>rhamirta area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>upper dhenbasana area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_trunks_in_the_dhenbasana for 10 years</li><li>ghavaanaj change herd growth:</li><ul><li>amount = 5</li></ul> | [Expand Grazing Grounds](#ghavaanaj_2_expand_grazing_grounds)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_feeding_the_herd">Feeding the Herd</a><br />*Our herds have reached a prodigious size, and while we are capable of feeding them, it does put some strain on the state. If we hope for herds of a truly great mammoth size, we will need to invest heavily in further infrastructure to support them.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 14</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is grain</li><li>trade goods  is livestock</li></ul><li>has building farm_estate</li></ul> | <li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = ghavaanaj_max_herd_size</li><li>value = 10</li></ul> | [Trunks in the Dhenbasana](#ghavaanaj_2_trunks_in_the_dhenbasana)<br />[The White Guild](#ghavaanaj_3_the_white_guild)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_lords_of_tusk_and_trunk">Lords of Tusk and Trunk</a><br />*The Ghavaanaj have always been known as Elephant Lords, but we have elevated the art of elephantry to even greater heights. Our herds are strong and numerous, and all who would think to oppose our ambitions know that if they do, they will be little more than a blade of grass under the thunder of our charge.* | <li>ghavaanaj has herd size 14 is yes</li> | <li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_lords_of_tusk_and_trunk until otherwise removed</li> | [Feeding the Herd](#ghavaanaj_2_feeding_the_herd)<br />[Pachyderm Expertise](#ghavaanaj_1_pachyderm_expertise)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_the_white_bull">The White Bull</a><br />*In much of Haless, white elephants are revered as spirits of nature, and their owners are required to treat them with the highest levels of care and allow others to come to pay tribute and worship them.\n\nSome of these beliefs have found their way into Ghavaanaji culture, and while we don't place special emphasis on white elephants, the beliefs of those who do can be used. If [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] were to be seen riding such a noble creature, and even taking one into battle and emerging victorious, it would make many of our soldiers even bolder in their charges.* | <li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is cavalry_power</li><li>value is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_the_white_bull until otherwise removed</li> | [Lords of Tusk and Trunk](#ghavaanaj_2_lords_of_tusk_and_trunk)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_2_the_great_trumpet">The Great Trumpet</a><br />*Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has made preparations for the largest parade to ever pass through Sharaajaghal, and while that is not unusual, they have kept even their closest advisors in the dark as to the specific reasoning. Given our current dominant nature in the region, some have speculated that this could be an announcement regarding the next steps of our country, while those in the halls of foreign powers are assuaging their masters' concerns by reassuring them this is a regular occurrence.\n\nAll eyes and ears are on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however, and whatever they say will be disseminated across all of Rahen faster than a charging elephant.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>cavalry in province is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Great Trumpet](../events/the_great_trumpet.md) happens</li> | [The White Bull](#ghavaanaj_2_the_white_bull)<br /> |

| <a name="ghavaanaj_3_the_black_kings_city">The Black King's City</a><br />*When the Nadimraj fell, the Ghavaanaji split into many tribes, with every elephant lord eyeing the other's land. It took a great man, Black King Kesarbai I, to bring them all together, and much of Ghavaanji culture is influenced by him.\n\nHis former capital was released from tribal control when we were made to bend the knee to Ramaplar, but with the tribes under our control, it is only natural that the greatest city of the Ghavaanaj should be too.* | <li>owns core province 4485</li> | <li>add legitimacy = 25</li><li>4485:</li><ul><li>move capital effect = yes</li></ul> | [The Desert Tribes](#ghavaanaj_2_the_desert_tribes)<br />[The Small Tribes](#ghavaanaj_3_the_small_tribes)<br />[The Black Tribe](#ghavaanaj_4_the_black_tribe)<br /> |

| <a name="ghavaanaj_3_dhujati_tusks">Dhujati Tusks</a><br />*Ivory serves a vital role in traditional medicines, and tusks are a highly sought after material for the upper castes; as a result, the ivory trade is a bloody and brutal affair.\n\nWhile we ensure that the ivory we supply comes from naturally deceased elephants, most of Dhujat -- and indeed the world -- instead murder innocent elephants, and sometimes rip their tusks out while still alive. Much of this trade occurs along the Kharunyana, so we should bring its banks under our control to regulate the ethics of this trade.* | <li>owns core province 4497</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is khirnadhiman_area</li><li>area  is keyattordha_area</li><li>area   is khiraspid_area</li><li>area    is tughayasa_area</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ghavaanaj_dhujati_tusks for 20 years</li> | [A New Black King](#ghavaanaj_3_a_new_black_king)<br /> |
| <a name="ghavaanaj_3_the_white_guild">The White Guild</a><br />*Now that we have brought all of Dhujat under our control, we can begin to regulate the ivory trade both internally, and along the Kharunyana.
