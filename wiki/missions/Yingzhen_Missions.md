| <a name="yingzhen_a_keeper_of_secrets">A Keeper of Secrets</a><br />*Every four years a vote is held, and every four years the ballots are tossed into the Yan. For as long as anybody can remember, Yingzhen has been ruled not my legitimate administrators but by sycophantic eunuchs. They do not serve the people, nor do they serve the city itself - they work for the interests of a reclusive syndicate of criminals known only as 'The Sinistral Chamber'* | <li>spymaster is at least 1</li> | <li>add government reform = sinistral_chamber_reform</li><li>the event [The Sinistral Chamber](../events/the_sinistral_chamber.md) happens</li> | [Lies and Slander](#yingzhen_lies_and_slander)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_oni_overture">Oni Overture</a><br />*To the north are the Oni of Azjakuma. Generally considered monstrous beasts, it is nonetheless undeniable that they are powerful practitioners of the Lefthand Path. Difficult as it may be, establishing relations with them may prove a worthwhile endeavor.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Y01:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 0</li></ul><li>is not at war</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y01</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is Y01:</li><ul><li>Y01:</li><ul><li>the event [An Offer](../events/an_offer.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier yingzhen_oni_knowledge for 25 years</li></ul> | [A Keeper of Secrets](#yingzhen_a_keeper_of_secrets)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_fulfill_the_contract">Fulfill The Contract</a><br />*An Oni diplomat, if one could call him that, has approached one of our men with an offer - to kill a member of their foe's court in exchange for a large quantity of their nation's riches. It should be a worthy excercise of our agents, if nothing else.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>is rival is Y01</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 60</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y01</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is Y01:</li><ul><li>the event [Our End Of The Bargain](../events/our_end_of_the_bargain.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If random country is rival is Y01, and  has spy network from has who is ROOT, and has spy network from has value is 60:</li><ul><li>the event [Murder!](../events/murder.md) happens</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Oni Overture](#yingzhen_oni_overture)<br /> |
| <a name="ying_best_things">Knives Out</a><br />*The League of Yanszin is dead. From Yangcheng to Bianfang, the Sinistral Chamber reigns supreme.  Once viewed as little more than a shady backwater, now even the most powerful men in Haless live in fear of finding themselves at the end of our killers' knives. For one of them, that fear shall soon become a reality...* | <li>any rival country:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If random rival country has spy network from has who is ROOT, and has spy network from has value is 100:</li><ul><li>the event [A Killer Among Us](../events/a_killer_among_us.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>the event [Sharpening The Knife](../events/sharpening_the_knife.md) happens</li><li>custom tooltip = y10_assassin_events_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [allow_yingzhen_events](../flags/allow_yingzhen_events.md)</li></ul> | [Fulfill The Contract](#yingzhen_fulfill_the_contract)<br />[Corrupt The Patrol](#yingzhen_corrupt_the_patrol)<br />[A Shield Against Zealots](#yingzhen_a_shield_against_zealots)<br /> |

| <a name="yingzhen_lies_and_slander">Lies and Slander</a><br />*It was proven to us all too recently that we cannot hold against Jingqui on the typical battlefield. With the loss of Caoying, our city stands all but helpless against to the ever-eager warlords that surround us. If we are to have any hopes of survival, we will need to reverse our course and reclaim our lands. \n \nBut this time, we will not shackle ourselves with the ways of our compatriots of the League - we will fight this our way.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Y02</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y02</li></ul><li>owns core province 4851</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is Y02, and  has 4848 has controlled by is Y02:</li><ul><li>the event [The Attack Commences](../events/the_attack_commences.md) happens</li></ul><li>jiangszun area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4952:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Y02</li><li>value = -40</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="yingzhen_never_saw_it_coming">Never Saw it Coming</a><br />*It is a poorly kept secret that our neighbors in Anjiang share close ties with the oracles of the Xiaken.  With the league's deterioration, plans have been drafted to intercept one of their messengers and manipulate them to our own ends.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Y04</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>church power is at least 75</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y04</li></ul><li>owns core province 4853</li><li>owns core province  4933</li><li>owns core province   4854</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Farsightedness](../events/farsightedness.md) happens</li><li>4933:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4853:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4854:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Y04</li><li>value = -50</li></ul> | [Lies and Slander](#yingzhen_lies_and_slander)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_steal_the_vote">Steal The Vote</a><br />*The city of Yangcheng are slaves to their own system, unquestionably accepting even the most absurd of results in an election. All it should take, then, is for our own mayor to run for the local title as well. Outlandish, but not actually illegal. Charismatic, competent, and supported by thousands of counterfeit votes he should win handily. * | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Y06</li><li>value is at least 60</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 150</li></ul><li>owns core province 4861</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Campaign Trail](../events/the_campaign_trail.md) happens</li><li>add treasury = -150</li><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Y06</li><li>value = -60</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Scholar's Rebellion](../events/the_scholar_s_rebellion.md) happens</li></ul> | [Never Saw it Coming](#yingzhen_never_saw_it_coming)<br />[A Keeper of Secrets](#yingzhen_a_keeper_of_secrets)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_corrupt_the_patrol">Corrupt The Patrol</a><br />*Yanzhong's trade is its life, and its Golden Patrol is the protector of that trade. Ever increasing recruitment drives present an opportunity to infiltrate the organization in large numbers. Combined with a few agents in key positions, the safety of their routes - and the nation itself - may be able to be toppled. Such an action is unlikely to go unnoticed, however.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Y08</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul><li>manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y08</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is Y08:</li><ul><li>the event [Tarnished Gold](../events/tarnished_gold.md) happens</li><li>add manpower = -5</li><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Y08</li><li>value = -50</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4855:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4859:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Steal The Vote](#yingzhen_steal_the_vote)<br /> |

It is imperative that we protect this new border, lest we find ourselves beneath their furious fists.* | <li>4826:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>4826:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = ramparts</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier yingzhen_shield for 25 years</li> | [Break The Fang](#yingzhen_break_the_fang)<br /> |

| <a name="yingzhen_appeasement">Appeasement</a><br />*It is not the head of a rebellion that should be targeted - It is the thousands of arms that hold its swords. With proper investment, the peoples of the League may very well be quelled into submission. \n \nThat the loudest of our critics will die in tragic accidents is, of course, purely coincidental.* | <li>original yanszin:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>original yanszin:</li><ul><li>add nationalism = -5</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = yingzhen_appeasement</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="yingzhen_benevolence">Benevolence</a><br />*Even the most inspiring leader will struggle to rouse a man to war whose belly is full and family is protected. By further investing in the citizens of the League, we will soon see them holding us in higher regard than the old nobles and leaders who once controlled them.* | <li>original yanszin:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0</li></ul></ul><li>tianszi area:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0</li></ul></ul> | <li>original yanszin:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -30</li><li>add prosperity = 30</li></ul><li>tianszi area:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -30</li><li>add prosperity = 30</li></ul> | [Appeasement](#yingzhen_appeasement)<br />[The Wayward City](#yingzhen_wayward_city)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_counter_counter">Counter Counter Espionage</a><br />*Our agents abroad have recently began returning home with reports of many new threats resulting from a practice known as 'Artificery'. They tell us of automaton guards who never sleep and never rest, or of devices capable of recording noises that would have once been undetectable. \n \nWe must make it our chief agenda to catch up to this leap in technology.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is yingzhen_spymaster_ruler_tt</li><li>has country flag [yingzhen_spymaster_ruler](../flags/yingzhen_spymaster_ruler.md)</li></ul><li>has institution manufactories</li><li>has estate privilege artifice_invention_directed_research</li><li>has estate privilege  estate_artificers_organization_state</li> | <li>country gets the modifier yingzhen_counter for 20 years</li> | [An Assassin's Creed](#yingzhen_assassins_creed)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_trade_secrets">Trade Secrets</a><br />*The Gnomes are Cannor are undisputed as masters of Artificery. It is from their lands that the most troublesome of these inventions hail - and many among the chamber believe that they will be the key to our defense against it. Already our agents begin scouring the gnomish lands for one who could be convinced to support our cause.* | <li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is gnomish</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Trade Secrets](../events/trade_secrets.md) happens</li> | [Counter Counter Espionage](#yingzhen_counter_counter)<br /> |

| <a name="yingzhen_best_defense">The Best Defense</a><br />*None are more familiar with the weaknesses of a castle than the ones who are dedicated to destroying them. With an assassin at the helm of our state, many of these weaknesses are being brought to light - often times by our own agents sneaking around in the dead of night to test them. \n \nA campaign is already underway - one to shore up the defenses of our nation, and ensure that the tactics we exploit can never be turned against us.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is yingzhen_assassin_ruler_tt</li><li>has country flag [yingzhen_assassin_ruler](../flags/yingzhen_assassin_ruler.md)</li></ul><li>4849:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>4849:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = yingzhen_best_defense_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [An Assassin's Creed](#yingzhen_assassins_creed)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_nothing_true">Nothing Is True</a><br />*Recent years have seen the state coffers being supplemented by a higher than usual number of contracts from foreign lands. The world seems to grow both larger and more tense by the day - and if we wish to keep up with the riches that are on offer to us, we must be certain that we can field a sufficient number of well-trained agents. \n \nA number of facilities have been proposed across our holdings - each with the purpose of selecting candidates for service in the Chamber, and training them to be competent agents of it.* | <li>university is at least 5</li> | <li>If has ruler flag is [yingzhen_first_assassin](../flags/yingzhen_first_assassin.md):</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier yingzhen_nothing_true_mod until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier yingzhen_nothing_true_mod for 25 years</li></ul> | [The Best Defense](#yingzhen_best_defense)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_everything_permitted">Everything Is Permitted</a><br />*We've grown our numbers to meet the growing demands of the world - and it begins to pay off.

| <a name="yingzhen_scale_sale">The Scale Sale</a><br />*A merchant from Tianlou has approached us in secret with an interesting offer. If we were to be willing to procure a large number of scales from the Kobolds to our north, he would pay us a great deal of coin. Of course, such a quantity will require a far more proactive means of harvesting than is typical in Yanshen.* | <li>4856:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4976:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Scale Sale](../events/the_scale_sale.md) happens</li> | [Secure The League](#yingzhen_secure_league)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_master_river">Master of The River</a><br />*Without the Yan, there would be nothing. There would be no Yingzhen, no Yanszin, there would be no Yanshen. In the old days, our city survived on the scraps of its trade - and even now, it ferries our agents through all of Haless. \n \nOur control of the river's source will cement our position as a power of Haless - dominating land routes between the great coastal cities to the east and the lords of Rahen to our west.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is y10_master_river_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>region is upper_yanshen_region</li></ul><li>total development is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If upper yanshen region does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If wanglam area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If hungngon area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4849:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul> | [The Wayward City](#yingzhen_wayward_city)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_secure_heartland">Secure The Heartland</a><br />*The Xianje to the west look to us with hostility - denouncing our state as 'thralls to the Oni', and the coastal Yan eye our dominance of the river with disdain. Our position is nothing if not precarious, and we must be certain to consolidate our homelands, lest a gap in our defenses spell our doom.* | <li>upper yanshen region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>4849:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul> | [The Black Hand That Feeds](#yingzhen_hand_feeds)<br />[A Dark Brotherhood](#yingzhen_dark_brotherhood)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_expand_reach">Expand Our Reach</a><br />*With each passing year, the Yan seems to host a greater number of foreigners from ever more distant lands - and with them come opportunities. As demand for our 'services' grows in far-flung places, relying on foreign ports to ferry our agents grows less feasible. \n \nThe Chamber believes that the less densely inhabited lands to our south may prove an ideal path to the sea. While such ports may never rival the likes of Tianlou, for our purposes they don't have to.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier yingzhen_agents_abroad until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier yingzhen_to_sea for 25 years</li> | [Secure The Heartland](#yingzhen_secure_heartland)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_assassins_creed">An Assassin's Creed</a><br />*In simpler times, the Chamber would choose Yingzhen's 'rulers' very carefully - competent enough to perform the tasks given to them, but never so much that they could hope to work against us. \n \nSuch an arrangement has obvious drawbacks, though. For one, veils of secrecy and limitations of powers leave us slow to respond to crises, and the 'head of state' being kept in the dark on so many matters has resulted in more than a few diplomatic blunders. \n \nNo, it is time - finally. This charade was only ever meant to appease our fellow league-cities and to ward off hungry warlords, and we have long since done away with both of those concerns. It is time for the Sinistral Chamber to rule in the open - anyone who wishes to stop us is free to make the attempt.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>republican tradition is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add government reform = sinistral_republic_reform</li><li>the event [A Departure From The Shadows](../events/a_departure_from_the_shadows.md) happens</li> | [Expand Our Reach](#yingzhen_expand_reach)<br />[A Quelled Countryside](#yingzhen_quelled_country)<br />[The Sinistral Respite](#yingzhen_sinistral_respite)<br /> |

| <a name="yingzhen_natural_enemy">A Natural Enemy</a><br />*The Xianjie have forever eyed our ascent with hostility. We are in many ways antithetical to them, zealots as they are. With our ever-growing strength, many among the Chamber believe it is time at last to strike at them - and to secure both the temple at Jianxusi as well as a much more favorable border along the mountains.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 6</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is aoshan_area</li><li>area  is wangqiu_area</li><li>area   is tietyuan_area</li></ul></ul> | <li>If erluxi area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4868:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [And There Came The Darkness](#yingzhen_came_darkness)<br /> |
| <a name="yingzhen_down_river">Down The River</a><br />*Our dominance of the river has already done a great deal to weaken the prospects of the remaining free cities downstream. The city of Jiangdu, in particular, appears to be a quite enticing target. With the west now secured, we have no reason not to turn our gaze east.* | <li>4868:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If ningxiang area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If liuminxiang area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Natural Enemy](#yingzhen_natural_enemy)<br /> |

A time where even the idea of survival seemed but a distant dream. \n \nToday, such dire times are but a distant dream - distant enough that some even wonder if they ever even happened, or if they were but stories meant to aggrandize the men and women who delivered us from them. Today the Yanszin are the masters of the Yan. Of Yanshen. Some even say of Haless itself. \n \nThey are wrong, of course.

At last, our star rises while theirs crashes to the ground - and it shall be a bloody affair for all. \n \nThis conquest will not be like those to our south.

Yingzhen in particular has benefited from this, and our capital's reputation has turned it into something of an infamous stop along the nearby trade routes. \n \nUnrestrained by the same moralty as our neighbors, grandiose brothels and gambling dens have become major sources of local income.

Still some few ships from far-off Eordand and Haraf make port in our foe's harbor. \n \nOur own ports, on the other hand, still suffer from a relative lack of trade. Fortunately for us, our reputation for an 'alternative' view on lawmaking has attracted a number of pirates from afar to reside in our lands.
