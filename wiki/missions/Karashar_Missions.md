| <a name="karashar_conquer_ovdal_tungr">Conquer Ovdal Tûngr</a><br />*Dwarves. We know dwarves. Know the way a blade cuts into their soft flesh, know the way their bones crunch underfoot. We thought in leaving the Serpentspine we left behind the need for all that knowledge, but it seems we thought wrong.\n\nThis remnant population of dwarves pollutes this land much as they polluted the one we left. These freedom-destroyers are part of the chains that have so long held back Surakel's chosen from His glory. Ovdal Tûngr must fall.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Ovdal Tungr</li></ul><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li> | [Liberate East Bahar](#karashar_liberate_west_bahar)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_city_of_the_black_sun">City of the Black Sun</a><br />*Where can a cursed orc must fervently pursue redemption? Where are the legions sworn to Surakel garrisoned, trained, and commanded? Where do His chosen purify the soul of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], in the Sacred Wives' tender ministrations?\n\nThe answer to all of these questions is the same. The City of the Black Sun, Karashar.* | <li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is karashar_city_dev20_tooltip</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has province flag [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md)</li><li>development is at least 20</li></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -200</li><li>If has any owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md), and does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>If random owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md):</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If random owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md):</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="karashar_religious_center">A Black Ziggurat</a><br />*When we first entered Bulwar, we were confused by the occasional stepped pyramids we came across, which were often in disrepair yet still imposed themselves on the landscape. It was only when we found one still burning a few fires did we learn Surakel's truth, and the role of these ziggurats in His worship — by building a staircase to the sun, we make it easier for Surakel when he chooses to return to us.\n\nIf we are to ever earn His forgiveness, we must build a ziggurat unlike any before. It shall be at the heart of the city of [Root.Capital.GetName], just as the quest for redemption is at the heart of Karashar.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is karashar_city_tax_tooltip</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has province flag [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md)</li><li>base tax is at least 10</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md):</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = karashar_religious_center_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [City of the Black Sun](#karashar_city_of_the_black_sun)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_heart_of_bulwar">Heart of Bulwar</a><br />*When we entered Bulwar, we were struck by the magnificent city-states, such a stark contrast to the desolate Serpentspine. We have learned the entire region is defined by those cities, even to its name.\n\nNow a new city stands astride the land: the city of Karashar.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is karashar_city_dev50_tooltip</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has province flag [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md)</li><li>development is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md):</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul><li>If random owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md):</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = karashar_heart_of_bulwar_modifier</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [A Black Ziggurat](#karashar_religious_center)<br />[Karashari Empire](#karashar_karashari_empire)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_black_sun_arises">Black Sun Arises</a><br />*Surakel's sun in the sky overhead is a symbol of many things. His sacrifice, which saved the world from devastation. His radiance, which illuminates the fabric of our lives. His glory, something none on Halann can rival.\n\nBut if anything could come close, it is the center of the Black Sun, Karashar. Despite our accursed beings, we have crafted a jewel that shines as bright as any the region has ever known. This is clear evidence that Forgiveness itself is within our reach, something we can achieve — if we only have the strength to reach for it.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is karashar_city_cot_tooltip</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has province flag [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md)</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li></ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 1500</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>If random owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md):</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 2</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has province flag is [karashar_city](../flags/karashar_city.md):</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = karashar_city_of_the_black_sun_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Heart of Bulwar](#karashar_heart_of_bulwar)<br /> |

| <a name="karashar_prepare_for_war">Prepare For War</a><br />*We are orcs. We know war. Known it for as long as we have walked Halann, as long as we have lived.\n\nBut all those years we lived and died in the darkness, and now we must fight for the light. We shall make war again, but it will be nothing like our conquests in the Serpentspine, nothing like our invasion into Bulwar. It shall be a war of redemption, of forgiveness, a war for Surakel's cause and His people. It shall be a war to end all wars in Bulwar, to prepare it for Surakel's coming.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.75</li> | <li>country gets the modifier karashar_war_preparations for 40 years</li><li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="karashar_liberate_west_bahar">Liberate East Bahar</a><br />*Once, we thought gold was the most valuable substance in existence. We have come to realize nothing is more valuable than Surakel's light, and we place nothing above our pursuit of the Forgiveness we may one day earn from him. Still, a lot of gold will be necessary for that cause, from adorning the palatial residences of the humans we have enlightened to funding the weaponry required. We should seize the gold mine in Azka-Evran for that purpose, and ensure the people of East Bahar are freed from toiling in its mines to pursue their existence as sun-chosen.* | <li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Prepare For War](#karashar_prepare_for_war)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_deal_with_aqatbar">Deal With the Goblins</a><br />*We are not the only ones to have spilled out of the Serpentspine and made war on the Bulwari. But the goblins, though right in their anti-elven ways, did not experience the same enlightenment we did. We cannot be sure why, but the consequence is clear: to atone for our own invasion, we must drive them out.* | <li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Marble Head Clan</li></ul> | <li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 10</li></ul><li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Liberate East Bahar](#karashar_liberate_west_bahar)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_liberate_east_bahar">Liberate West Bahar</a><br />*When the sun sets in Bulwar, it goes down in West Bahar. But now a new sun shall rise over it: the Black Sun, bringing with it a reminder of Surakel's truth.* | <li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Deal With the Goblins](#karashar_deal_with_aqatbar)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_conquer_crathanor">Conquer Crathánor</a><br />*We were born knowing how to conquer amidst cavern and tunnel. We have learned how to make war in hilly Bahar and on the vast plains of Bulwar. But now we must learn one more terrain: the sea. Though it is unsteady beneath us, and no orc quite feels comfortable aboard a ship, such is the price of our redemption. Surakel shall see us through, and ensure we can bring all the sun-chosen into His domain.* | <li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier karashar_crathanor_conquered for 25 years</li> | [Liberate West Bahar](#karashar_liberate_east_bahar)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_restore_surani_irrigation_systems">Restore Surani Irrigation</a><br />*Of all the gifts Surakel gave to Bulwar, few are as life-defining as the Surani river, which makes an otherwise dry land lush and arable. But in the sun elves' heresy, they let the irrigation systems that ensures His blessing reaches all who need it decay, and they show the wear of decades of missed maintenance and gnollish raids. The pretenders cared not for the challenge of growing food, merely demanded it be provided in lavish banquets to satisfy their obscene gluttony.\n\nWe have come to restore Surakel's light to all Bulwari, and we shall not ignore this vital conduit. Whatever the cost, the Surani irrigation systems must be restored.* | <li>suran river:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 2000</li> | <li>add treasury = -2000</li><li>suran river:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = karashar_restored_irrigation_system</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If suran river has trade goods is grain:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li></ul> | [Karashari Empire](#karashar_karashari_empire)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_granary_of_sarhal">Granary of Sarhal</a><br />*Every living being that walks Halann or crawls in its dirt ultimately owes its existence to Surakel, who sacrificed Himself to save us all from the Day of Ashen Skies. But this truth is made even more apparent when we look to the plants the flourish under his sun, the growing wheat and fruit that transmute His light into the food that nourishes us. To serve Him best, we must ensure even the plants of Bulwar flourish under His light, and when we do so we will surely be the granary of all Sarhal.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>trade goods is grain</li><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier karashar_granary_of_sarhal_modifier for 100 years</li> | [Restore Surani Irrigation](#karashar_restore_surani_irrigation_systems)<br /> |

| <a name="karashar_first_step_to_forgiveness">First Step to Forgiveness</a><br />*The sins that stain our souls black as night have been amassed over generations, each driving us far from Surakel's light. So too will be the work of serving His cause, freeing His chosen people, and finding whatever modicum of redemption He feels we deserve. But it is the work the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] calls us to do, and now, we shall take the first step towards the Forgiveness.* | <li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>is subject of type is vassal</li><li>has country modifier human_administration</li></ul> | <li>sareyand area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>avamezan area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>south naza area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>east naza area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier karashar_first_step_to_forgiveness_modifier for 25 years</li><li>custom tooltip = karashar_vassal_purging_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [karashar_vassal_purging](../flags/karashar_vassal_purging.md)</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="karashar_crush_sareyand">Crush Sareyand</a><br />*Under Jaher, the Phoenix Empire struck a vast blow for the Malevolent Darkness, enchaining the Bulwari people's minds even if it freed their bodies. Though that ancient wreck fell apart, as all who betray Surakel shall, the sun elves of Sareyand are among the foremost of those pretending to reform it.\n\nAt the country's center lays the Ash Palace, a great carcass, black and empty. So too is every one of the sun elves' promises, every one of their deeds. We shall make this clear when we shatter them and strike a blow for every Bulwari they have exploited.* | <li>625:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Sareyand</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>panuses area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>eduz vacyn area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>upper suran area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [First Step to Forgiveness](#karashar_first_step_to_forgiveness)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_liberate_upper_suran">Liberate Upper Suran</a><br />*We came from the mountains, where our bodies and minds were both engulfed in darkness. But now that we have struck into Bulwar, we must march towards the mountains once again, following the Suran north and freeing the humans along the way. As we walk alongside the flowing river, under the pouring sun, let us be reminded of Surakel's strength and grace.* | <li>panuses area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>eduz vacyn area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>upper suran area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier karashar_upper_suran_liberated for 20 years</li><li>jixobix area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>harklum area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>zansap area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Crush Sareyand](#karashar_crush_sareyand)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_liberate_zansap">Liberate Zanšap</a><br />*Among the many that were deceived by the sun elves' dark and wicked words of heresy, few were as deeply enshrouded in shadow as the Zanšapian. It may take a great deal of effort to fully restore them to Surakel's worship, but they are as sun-chosen as any other, and the labour we do for His sake and our redemption was never going to be easy.* | <li>harklum area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>jixobix area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>zansap area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 100</li><li>garpix tluukt area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>grixekyr area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>sur mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>691:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Liberate Upper Suran](#karashar_liberate_upper_suran)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_purge_tluukt">Purge Tluukt</a><br />*The Cleaver-of-Realms cleaved Bulwar in twain when she struck, taking many of the sun-chosens' lives and enchaining even more to brutal servitude. If we seek to restore Surakel's realm, bring it peace, and prepare it for His coming, she — and any trace of her demonic kind — must be purged.* | <li>garpix tluukt area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>grixekyr area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>sur mountains area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>691:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier karashar_tluukt_purged for 40 years</li> | [Liberate Zanšap](#karashar_liberate_zansap)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_karashari_empire">Karashari Empire</a><br />*The Black Sun has come to Bulwar. It shines high in the sky, its banner stark above every city and every field. And as it has soared into the skies above, the Black Sun has brought with it peace, prosperity, the true worship of Surakel.\n\nThere is still more to do to earn our Forgiveness. There will be more to do until Surakel Himself returns. But insofar as we can ever scrub some of the stain off our souls, as [Root.Monarch.GetName] looks to the realm [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] leads, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] knows we have done it.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li><li>value is at least 80</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>culture group is bulwari</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>vassal of is this nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>If does not have country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>elizna area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>ibtat axast area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>awaashesh area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>masusopot area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier karashar_empire_modifier for 50 years</li> | [Conquer Crathánor](#karashar_conquer_crathanor)<br />[Purge Tluukt](#karashar_purge_tluukt)<br />[Handle the Dwarves](#karashar_eliminate_dwarven_threat)<br />[Invade Bulwar](#karashar_invade_bulwar)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_finish_last_pretenders">Finish Last Pretenders</a><br />*Though the Sun Elves have almost been completely banished from Bulwar proper, they maintain one last bastion to the southwest. If we are to truly purge their heresy, the elves of Elizna must die. The humans they have subjugated, while perhaps not sun-chosen, can also learn something of Surakel's light.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Elizna</li></ul><li>elizna area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>ibtat axast area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>awaashesh area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>masusopot area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>salahad superregion:</li><ul><li>If does not have country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and  is city:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier karashar_last_pretenders_finished for 50 years</li> | [Karashari Empire](#karashar_karashari_empire)<br /> |
| <a name="karashar_beyond_bulwar">Beyond Bulwar</a><br />*There is not an inch of Halann that Surakel's sun does not touch — aside from, of course, our accursed birthplace the Serpentspine. And so we too must set our sights beyond Bulwar, to ensure the Black Sun has similar reach. To the west lay many who have yet to learn His truth — let us correct that at once.* | <li>salahad superregion:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>is not city</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul><li>add adm power = 200</li><li>add dip power = 200</li><li>add mil power = 200</li> | [Finish Last Pretenders](#karashar_finish_last_pretenders)<br /> |

Every citizen of Karashar has toiled for the same, from the sacred wives to the orcs that lived and died for this cause.\n\nPerhaps we will not achieve total forgiveness until Surakel returns to rule Bulwar, and lead it into an age of light and glory. But everything else that we might do, everything we might forge in His name and His honour — it has been done.* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is karashar_the_forgiveness_tooltip</li><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>is prosperous</li><li>value is at least 80</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier karashar_the_forgiveness_modifier until otherwise removed</li> | [Black Sun Arises](#karashar_black_sun_arises)<br />[Granary of Sarhal](#karashar_granary_of_sarhal)<br />[Beyond Bulwar](#karashar_beyond_bulwar)<br />[Return Valleys to Humans](#karashar_return_valleys_to_humans)<br />[Silver Age of Bulwar](#karashar_silver_age_of_bulwar)<br /> |

But there is much more to learn of His ways, and much more to be done. We must employ those who know His ways best, to guide us in the steps we must take for His Forgiveness.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is karashar_bulwari_osc_advisor_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is bahari</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is gelkar</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is brasanni</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is surani</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is zanite</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is maqeti</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is sadnatu</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is masnsih</li><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = 200</li><li>azka sur area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>grixek area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>jikarzax area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="karashar_liberate_azka_sur">Liberate Azka-Sur</a><br />*Azka-Sur claims to be the 'Fortress of the Sun', a bastion of the light. But even their sturdy walls could not keep out the elvish lies which poisoned their brains and rotted their faith. Most have even abandoned the old ziggurat for newer temples, letting it fall to nigh-ruin.\n\nThey have sturdy walls, fearsome defences. But we Orcs have broken stronger, and know well how to pay the required prices in blood. We must restore the Fortress of the Sun to Surakel's truth.

From glittering jewels to pristine silks, we saw luxuries we had not even imagined existed. These were, of course only a clue to that most precious good of all: the knowledge of Surakel's truth. Still, we should secure the desert roads and caravansarai along which these trade routes flow, to ensure the sun-chosen can live the life of luxury they deserve.* | <li>xhurgrum area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>harpys gate area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>saranza area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>keruhar area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>far salahad region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier karashar_deserd_roads_secured for 25 years</li> | [Liberate Azka-Sur](#karashar_liberate_azka_sur)<br /> |

Purged from every field and every farm and every city. There is only the truth of Surakel, the love of His embrace.

But the revelation of our Surakel-given purpose has proved difficult for some to swallow, even after the Karakal's ascension.

The only reason to look to the sky should be to behold the glory of Surakel's sun, never in fear of a winged predator.\n\nThough their roosts may hard to siege, we are willing to shed any amount of blood to liberate Surakel's chosen from this threat.
