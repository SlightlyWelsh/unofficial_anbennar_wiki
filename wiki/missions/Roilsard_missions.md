| <a name="roilsard_attract_adventurers">Attract Adventurers</a><br />*With the end of the Greentide in Escann so has come the time for many of the brave men and women fighting in the war to return as well, while Roilsard is full of these brave people our primary contingent in the war came from the síl Vivin run Company of the Thorn. With them now returning home, we should see to it to invest properly in housing and servicing these experienced veterans so as to have an army able to defend our reunited Roilsard from any invaders.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 40</li><li>40:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>eastern winebay area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "roilsard_state_manpower"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>40:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="roilsard_permanent_arms">Permanent Arms</a><br />*While no one can doubt their military experience we have quickly found an issue with our idea of an army of adventurers, they are too few on account of most remaining to continue the fight in Escann. While we can still maintain a core of skilled veterans to boost morale within our troops, a proper army needs size, a size we need to find among properly trained commoners and peasants, no feudal levy loyal to one of the four houses, but loyal to Roilsard, to their home.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "roilsard_army_enthusiasm" for 25 years</li> | [Attract Adventurers](#roilsard_attract_adventurers)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_jack">Jacques's Reforms</a><br />*Jacques síl Vivin was a competent Roilsardi commander during the Lilac Wars, while he served in our war effort early on in the war, he was later fired by the ruling síl Roilsard under vague accusations of treachery that we now in hindsight can see was due to being a part of the rival síl Vivin family. Competent and experienced, had he not been fired, he may very much have led us to victory during the disastrous battle of Redfort. Nonetheless, while the years have gone by, he still lives, looking spry for his age and has even developed upon his old ideas to fit the ever-changing battlefield. Now we shall not commit the same mistake that was done during the Lilac Wars, and instead we shall use his knowledge to make our army one that any Lorentish knight fears.* | <li>num of generals is at least 1</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is army_organiser</li></ul> | <li>add army professionalism = 0.05</li><li>If tretunica area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Permanent Arms](#roilsard_permanent_arms)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_tretunic_roots">Tretunic Roots</a><br />*Long ago the Duchy of Roilsard was once considered part of the Kingdom of Tretun. However, the ancient kingdom is now gone, and its pauper remnants are now under the wine lord of Rubenaire, and we as the Roilsardi people are resurgent. We must destroy the last vestiges of the Tretunic fools once and for all, making it clear that Roilsard bows to no King.* | <li>tretunica area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sil_vivin_dynasty</li><li>has ruler flag [roilsard_sil_vivin](../flags/roilsard_sil_vivin.md)</li></ul> | <li>tretunica area:</li><ul><li>change culture = roilsardi</li></ul><li>the event [The Thorned Raven](../events/the_thorned_raven.md) happens</li> | [Thorn Crown's Dynasties](#roilsard_many_dynasties)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_thorned_raven">The Thorned Raven's Flight</a><br />*After her departure many were sceptical that Madaléin would return, fearing she would meet a similar fate to those who sought out Aelantir in the past, sceptical of the rumours coming from Lorent of a rediscovered Aelantir. Madaléin, however, did return, bringing with her news of her expedition, confirming the existence of Aelantir and opening many opportunities for exploration to the east.* | <li>any province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>continent is south_america</li><li>continent  is north_america</li><li>continent   is africa</li></ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sil_vivin_dynasty</li><li>has ruler flag [roilsard_sil_vivin](../flags/roilsard_sil_vivin.md)</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "roilsard_colonial_rush" for 5 years</li> | [Tretunic Roots](#roilsard_tretunic_roots)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_operations_base">A Base of Operations</a><br />*The Roilsardi spirit is an adventurous one and after the return of the expedition many brave pioneers sought to settle this new land in the name of Roilsard.

| <a name="roilsard_seat_of_power">A Seat of Power</a><br />*With the reunification of the country complete, the síl Saloren have come with a promising proposition of a fixed capital in Saloren for the entire country, rather than each house having their own seats of power. While clearly benefiting themselves, Saloren offers promise due both to its fortifications and its distance from the rose that divided us. No matter if we take them up on the offer or not, building the necessary infrastructure to build up Saloren as either our primary or secondary seat of power would be a good idea and would surely greatly please the house of Saloren.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 32</li><li>32:</li><ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>the event [A New Capital](../events/a_new_capital.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="roilsard_the_saloren">The Saloren</a><br />*With our rise in power, it was only a matter of time until we seized upon what makes the Wine Lords truly powerful. Let us put our own stamp on the Wineries within our domain, creating a truly Saloreni flavour, and a central market to distribute it. This will both enrich our cultural influence and wealth, as well as fund the construction of a most impressive Capital.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 32</li><li>32:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 8</li></ul> | <li>32:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "roilsard_the_saloren"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Seat of Power](#roilsard_seat_of_power)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_expanding_toarnaire">Expanding the City</a><br />*While historically being seen as outside the power struggles in Roilsard, being not owned by any of the four houses, Toarnaire ended up, alongside many other wine merchants, revolting during the Lilac Wars. With this rebellion now stamped out of our city, we must see to both building up the city as our central trading hub in the Bay of Wines, but also to reassure the merchants that their interests are a part of the interests of a united Roilsard, so as to never fracture again.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 33</li><li>33:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>33:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = roilsard_toarnaire_trade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>eastern winebay area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "roilsard_state_dev_cost"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Saloren](#roilsard_the_saloren)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_merchant_navy">Expand the Merchant Navy</a><br />*A powerful navy controls the oceans around Lencenor, and protects our interests abroad. While we cannot hope to match the navies of the larger nations, we can expand the merchant marine of the State, increasing our own profits, and creating a bulwark against hostile elements seeking to ravage our independent merchants.* | <li>num of light ship is at least 15</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "eng_channel_dominance" for 15 years</li> | [Expanding the City](#roilsard_expanding_toarnaire)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_befriend_minar">Befriend Minar Temple</a><br />*Following the Lilac Wars, Minar Temple was left in a precarious position, beset on all sides by would-be conquerors; they were forced to turn to Wineport, our old rivals, for protection. Now that we have pushed the merchants out of our territory and proven them incapable of protecting Minar, perhaps it would be best if we were to offer Minar our protection instead, in exchange for their recognition in the liberation of the remaining Minari in the eastern Winebay.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>A10:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li><li>exists</li></ul></ul><li>A10:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 97</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sil_loop_dynasty</li><li>has ruler flag [roilsard_sil_loop](../flags/roilsard_sil_loop.md)</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sil_saloren_dynasty</li><li>has ruler flag [roilsard_sil_saloren](../flags/roilsard_sil_saloren.md)</li></ul></ul> | <li>If lower winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Thorn Crown's Dynasties](#roilsard_many_dynasties)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_reaching_across">Reaching Across the Bay</a><br />*We have crushed Wineport and the rebels, and freed the Minari under their boot. However, there are still some Minari that have yet to come under our banner and the war for the Bay is far from complete. We should offer Minar Temple a position in our realm as a direct vassal of our ruler.* | <li>lower winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>owned by  is Minaran Temple</li></ul></ul> | <li>If lower bloodwine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If southern flats area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has exists is A10:</li><ul><li>vassalize = A10</li></ul> | [Befriend Minar Temple](#roilsard_befriend_minar)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_deal_with_lords">Entangling the Wine Lords</a><br />*The Wine Lords of Lencenor are a decadent lot, and unlike us, they stand disunited, fighting each other in petty skirmishes and small wars, seeking to gain the upper hand on their fellows. We should show them a new way, united under Roilsard they will have no need for petty squabbles. Of course, controlling their land has other benefits, such as allowing for greater control over wine production in Lencenor, but that is at most a fortunate coincidence.* | <li>lower bloodwine area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>113:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul></ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Reaching Across the Bay](#roilsard_reaching_across)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_sack_deranne">Those Who Abandoned Us</a><br />*During the Lilac Wars, the duke of Deranne abandoned us, surrendering to Lorent and leaving Roilsard to die at the hands of the Lorentish. The time has come to take our revenge. We will march and Deranne and do to them what they allowed to happen to us. Deranne will be burned to the ground.* | <li>113:</li><ul><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sil_loop_dynasty</li><li>has ruler flag [roilsard_sil_loop](../flags/roilsard_sil_loop.md)</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sil_saloren_dynasty</li><li>has ruler flag [roilsard_sil_saloren](../flags/roilsard_sil_saloren.md)</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Sack of Deranne](../events/the_sack_of_deranne.md) happens</li> | [Entangling the Wine Lords](#roilsard_deal_with_lords)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_beyond_reach">Beyond Lorent's Reach</a><br />*Lorent holds a monopoly on wine exports within Lencenor, and they charge huge tariffs on our merchants, costing them dearly. For this reason, the síl na Loop have approached the síl Vivin, hoping to use their overseas expansion and the goods traded there, to supplement lost profits.* | <li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_isles</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_endralliande</li></ul></ul><li>num of cities is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "roilsard_tariffs" until otherwise removed</li> | [A Base of Operations](#roilsard_operations_base)<br /> |
| <a name="roilsard_bloodsuckers">Hunting the Bloodsuckers</a><br />*Our conquistadors have returned with word of the lands south of our colonies, and what we have heard disgusted us. Horrific leech-like creatures that feed on the blood of men. We must do all we can to remove these abominations from Halann, with the Leechdens being our prize for this noble task.* | <li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_leechden</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_lai_peninsula</li></ul></ul><li>num of cities is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "roilsard_trade_steering" for 50 years</li> | [Beyond Lorent's Reach](#roilsard_beyond_reach)<br /> |

But as we have proved and shall continue to prove, the people of Roilsard are strong, and our army relies not on elite knights but on that strong populace.

Following this, Lorent did the unthinkable, shattering the duchy of Roilsard and giving our lands as a prize to their ally Rubenaire.
