| <a name="peitar_prepare_the_gladewardens">Prepare the Gladewardens</a><br />*The Gladewardens are an elite sect of warriors, scouts, and paladins. Believing zealously in the power and guidance of the Fey Lords, they serve them unquestionably patrolling the Domandrod. However, they might be persuaded to join our cause. Us Peitar are humble servants of the Fey Lords, it should be no problem to gather the Gladewardens if we remind them of this.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 1</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>area for scope province:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>base manpower is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>create general:</li><ul><li>tradition = 50</li></ul> | [Congregation of the Faithful](#peitar_congregation_of_the_faithful)<br /> |
| <a name="peitar_rein_in_the_wayward_flock">Rein in the Wayward Flock</a><br />*Ever since the betrayal of seasonal heretics, Eordand has been splintered into countless tribes and polities. None but the Peitar stay true to the old traditions, the right traditions. We must uphold our vows and shepherd the heretics back into the fold, by war if necessary. Any blood spilt will be necessary, not even a cost, for our cause is just.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is peitar_rein_wayward</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is selphereg</li><li>primary culture  is tuathak</li><li>primary culture   is caamas</li><li>primary culture    is snecboth</li></ul><li>war with is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "peitar_pride_of_the_faithful" for 15 years</li> | [Prepare the Gladewardens](#peitar_prepare_the_gladewardens)<br /> |
| <a name="peitar_extinguish_heretical_worship">Extinguish Heretical Worship</a><br />*The Fey Lords taught us to respect the natural beauty and power of the seasons, but the heretics twisted their words and began their blasphemous reverence of one season above all. The natural order of the world is the flow of the seasons, one never empowered above the rest. The crime of breaking the natural order should be met with swift and firm justice. But if we are to integrate the heretics back into the fold, they cannot all be dead. They should feel gratitude for our mercy.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>area for scope province:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "peitar_inquisition" for 25 years</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li> | [Rein in the Wayward Flock](#peitar_rein_in_the_wayward_flock)<br /> |

| <a name="peitar_congregation_of_the_faithful">Congregation of the Faithful</a><br />*Those faithful and true to the Fey Lords are scattered across Eordand in their own enclaves. Our greatest flaw, the Peitar themselves bicker amongst each other for petty reasons. It is time to convene a grand meeting of the Peitar nations and unite against the heretics!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is peitar_congregation</li><li>num of allies is at least 2</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>primary culture is peitar</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "peitar_congregation_convened" for 15 years</li> |  |

| <a name="peitar_seasonal_neutrality">Seasonal Neutrality</a><br />*The Peitar are those who remained loyal to the doctrine of seasonal neutrality set by the Domandrod Fey.

| <a name="peitar_domandrod_communities">Domandrod Communities</a><br />*The Domandrod is the forbidden domain of the Fey Lords, a mystical forest replete with both beauty and danger. However, due to our humble service to the Fey, the Peitar have been permitted to dwell within the forest. Although those settlements are beyond our reach, there are some in the boundaries of our realm that are beholden to our rule. We must extend our rule in these regions and claim the riches of the Domandrod for ourselves!* | <li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 50</li><li>culture is peitar</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "peitar_domandrod_communities" for 25 years</li> | [Seasonal Neutrality](#peitar_seasonal_neutrality)<br /> |
| <a name="peitar_service_to_the_fey_lords">Service to the Fey Lords</a><br />*As our influence over the outskirts of the Domandrod grows, the Fey Lords have requested that we show proper deference. They require that we honor them with glory, and specify that we must make those kneel who are not our own. Some skeptics suggest in a borderline heretical statement that the Fey mean for us to focus our attention elsewhere, but what do they know?* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is peitar_service</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is peitar</li></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>country gets the modifier "peitar_blessings_of_the_fey" for 25 years</li> | [Domandrod Communities](#peitar_domandrod_communities)<br /> |

| <a name="peitar_final_thawing">Final Thawing</a><br />*Far in the north of Eordand, the Winter Court stagnates in their adoration of Winter.

| <a name="peitar_claim_oathsworn_legacy">Claim the Oathsworn Legacy</a><br />*While we Peitar have sworn to restore the balance of the seasons throughout Eordand, our allegiance to the so-called Oathsworns of Pelomar are tenuous. Ever since the defeat of the first Pelodan, the Peitar tribes have acted independently of the Pelomar. For the sake of our cause, let us assume the title of Oathsworn to those worthy of its title.* | <li>owns core province 2049</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Pelomar</li></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy large effect = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>the event [Demands of the Domandrod](../events/demands_of_the_domandrod.md) happens</li> |  |

| <a name="peitar_ward_of_summer">Ward of Summer</a><br />*The official gateway into the Domandrod in the south, Sidpar has traditionally been stewarded by the Swiftswords of the Peitar.
