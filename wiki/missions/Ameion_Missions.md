| <a name="G52_state_city">State for the City</a><br />*As we expand eastward and deliver stability to the war-torn peninsula of Taychend, we must also continue to strengthen our powerbase closer to home. The Basobhar near us control plenty of fields ripe for farming, forests teething with lumber, and hills waiting patiently for their ores to be uncovered.\nWe must send forward our own settlers and claim these lands in the name of Ameion.* | <li>owns 2619</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>manpower is at least 5</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add manpower = -5</li><li>country gets the modifier G52_interior_development for 40 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G52_approach_mteibhar">Approach the Mteibhar</a><br />*The Mteibhar gather in their valley peacefully every once in a while to partake in their religious practices. If we were to attend one of these gatherings, we can use their banner of peace to conduct diplomacy with their leadership, and lay the groundwork for their incorporation under Ameion like the Taychendi. They will not submit voluntarily, but knowing and respecting their customs will relieve any tensions their subjugation will create.* | <li>2619:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 2619</li></ul><li>area is kankotrund_area</li><li>is city</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Mteibhara</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>prestige is Mteibhara</li> | <li>the event [Leaders' Meeting](../events/leaders_meeting.md) happens</li><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = G63</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul> | [State for the City](#G52_state_city)<br />[City for the State](#G52_city_state)<br /> |
| <a name="G52_place_exile">Place of Exile</a><br />*While the vast majority of Taychendi have benefitted from our rule, there are some who are adamant about their desire to rule themselves. Regardless of evidence to the contrary, they insist they would be better off without our intervention.\n\nThose of Vul Tenvach have been more diplomatic, and offered a proposition: we shall fund and assist their efforts to settle an uninhabited island to the east, where those discontent with our rule can exile to.\n\nWhile peculiar, having a place to put those with no hope of saving from their destructive ways may prove beneficial to the majority who remain here.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Vul Tenvach</li></ul><li>2537:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>religion is kheionism</li></ul><li>has discovered is at least 2324</li><li>has discovered  is at least 2316</li><li>has discovered   is at least 2314</li><li>is not at war</li><li>treasury is at least 300</li> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>the event [Civilization of Exiles](../events/civilization_of_exiles.md) happens</li><li>country gets the modifier G52_exiling_uncivilized for 25 years</li> | [Islands Uncivilized](#G52_islands_uncivilized)<br /> |
| <a name="G52_peace_coexistance">Peace Through Coexistence</a><br />*Considering the size of this island, the fact that we have found no evidence of civilization here has become quite interesting. While the Taychendi methods are crude, they are vastly superior to allow the land to sit empty of cities. Under our authority, perhaps their culture can flourish into something other than a wasteland.* | <li>G79:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>region is severed_coast_region</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>G79:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G52_G79_loyalty for 30 years</li></ul><li>If severed coast region does not have core is G79; and does not have permanent claim is G79:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = G79</li></ul> | [Place of Exile](#G52_place_exile)<br /> |
| <a name="G52_land_unruly">Land for the Unruly</a><br />*As we prepare to teach the Taychendi our Kheionai ways, it becomes more and more clear that some will never progress beyond their barbaric ways. Fortunately, they are in the minority, but even still there is an increasing need to relocate these individuals so that they do not radicalize their peers. Expanding our oversees colony will provide ample land for these radicals to live away from us in peace.* | <li>G79:</li><ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 8</li><li>region is severed_coast_region</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = ameion_liteibhar_convert_3</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>G79:</li><ul><li>If random owned province does not have culture group is taychendi ruinborn elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = gods_of_the_taychend</li><li>change culture = thekvrystana</li></ul><li>If random owned province does not have culture group is taychendi ruinborn elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = gods_of_the_taychend</li><li>change culture = yodhanpir</li></ul><li>If random owned province does not have culture group is taychendi ruinborn elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = gods_of_the_taychend</li><li>change culture = yodhanpir</li></ul></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier G52_continued_deportations for 25 years</li> | [Freedom in Unity](#G52_freedom_unity)<br /> |
| <a name="G52_isle_severance">The Isle of Severance</a><br />*What was intended to be a disposal bin for the stubborn Taychendi has proved to be a profitable venture in of itself, the taxation provided by the island's government has supplemented our treasury with little further effort needed on our end.\n\nEnsuring they have no worries of border conflicts will ensure this revenue goes uninterrupted, and allow any who resist our rule to live elsewhere while still paying their due.* | <li>severed coast region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is Vul Tenvach</li><li>area is rezailan_area</li><li>province id is at least 2310</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = ameion_liteibhar_convert_4</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>G79:</li><ul><li>If random owned province does not have culture group is taychendi ruinborn elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = gods_of_the_taychend</li><li>change culture = thekvrystana</li></ul><li>If random owned province does not have culture group is taychendi ruinborn elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = gods_of_the_taychend</li><li>change culture = yodhanpir</li></ul><li>If random owned province does not have culture group is taychendi ruinborn elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = gods_of_the_taychend</li><li>change culture = kalavendhi</li></ul><li>If random owned province does not have culture group is taychendi ruinborn elf:</li><ul><li>change religion = gods_of_the_taychend</li><li>change culture = larankarha</li></ul></ul></ul><li>add historical friend = G79</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>G79:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = G52</li><li>add historical friend = G00</li></ul><li>G00:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = G79</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier G52_severing_uncivilizable for 30 years</li> | [Land for the Unruly](#G52_land_unruly)<br /> |

| <a name="G52_city_state">City for the State</a><br />*While our strength is comparable, if not greater, than the true kheions from which our ancestors hail, it is known that Ameion is not as glorious a city as the kheions. As we seek to civilize the Taychendi, we must demonstrate the core principle of Kheionism; the place and power of the city within a civilization.* | <li>is institution enabled is renaissance</li><li>2620:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If has 2620 has province has center of trade of level is 1; and does not have 2620 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>2620:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 200</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier G52_birth_kheion for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G52_approach_chendhyan">Approach the Chendhyan</a><br />*The feline-riders of the Chendhyan steppes not only partake in barbaric acts of raid and plunder, but they embody them. To them, their freedom must come at the expense of others. If we are to prevent these practices, we must not only understand them, but show them the consequences of their hostilities.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>H23</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>H28</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>H29</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul><li>prestige is H23</li><li>prestige  is H28</li><li>prestige   is H29</li> | <li>the event [A Trip North](../events/a_trip_north.md) happens</li><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = H23</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = H28</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = H29</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul> | [City for the State](#G52_city_state)<br /> |
| <a name="G52_embrace_humble">Embrace the Humble</a><br />*The Devandi value their liberty highly, but as far as the average man is concerned what matters most is their day-to-day life. We may win easy victories over their armies, but what will keep them from rising again shall be how we improve their lives under our rule. There may be glory in raiding, but they shall learn the comforts of a well tended field.* | <li>G63:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>H23:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>H28:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>H29:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -50</li><li>2660:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 100</li></ul></ul><li>G63:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 100</li></ul></ul><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier G52_integrating_kin for 50 years</li></ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = autonomous_vassal</li><li>subject = G63</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = ameion_chendhyans</li><li>If has H23 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>H23:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 100</li></ul></ul><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li></ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = autonomous_vassal</li><li>subject = H23</li></ul></ul><li>If has H28 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>H28:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 100</li></ul></ul><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li></ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = autonomous_vassal</li><li>subject = H28</li></ul></ul><li>If has H29 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>H29:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 100</li></ul></ul><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li></ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = autonomous_vassal</li><li>subject = H29</li></ul></ul> | [Approach the Mteibhar](#G52_approach_mteibhar)<br />[Approach the Chendhyan](#G52_approach_chendhyan)<br /> |
| <a name="G52_kheion_past">Kheion Past Alecand</a><br />*Ameion has grown as a kheion significantly in recent years, fueled by the wealth of Taychend. In many ways it has become superior to the true kheions of the west, and it is time we gain recognition for this. Bringing representatives from Alecand to showcase our mighty capital will prove to them the kheionai lifestyle is attainable even beyond their home island.* | <li>2620:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>exists is Arpedifer</li><li>exists  is Oktikheion</li><li>exists   is Kimanis</li><li>exists    is Degakheion</li><li>exists     is Ormam</li><li>exists      is Kherka</li><li>exists       is Lokemeion</li><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Arpedifer</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Oktikheion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Kimanis</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Degakheion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Ormam</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Kherka</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Lokemeion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>exists is Arpedifer</li><li>exists  is Oktikheion</li><li>exists   is Kimanis</li><li>exists    is Degakheion</li><li>exists     is Ormam</li><li>exists      is Kherka</li><li>exists       is Lokemeion</li><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Arpedifer</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Oktikheion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Kimanis</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Degakheion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Ormam</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Kherka</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Lokemeion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>exists is Arpedifer</li><li>exists  is Oktikheion</li><li>exists   is Kimanis</li><li>exists    is Degakheion</li><li>exists     is Ormam</li><li>exists      is Kherka</li><li>exists       is Lokemeion</li><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Arpedifer</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Oktikheion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Kimanis</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Degakheion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Ormam</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Kherka</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Lokemeion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>G52 ideas is at least 2</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li></ul> | <li>If does not have G52 ideas is 2:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -100</li></ul><li>add prestige = 30</li><li>add republican tradition = 5</li><li>2620:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = G52_recognized_kheion</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Embrace the Humble](#G52_embrace_humble)<br /> |

At the time Laskaris decided it would spread our efforts too thin, and a settlement there may have been put under siege by [G71.GetName].\n\nNow that we have secured our position in Taychend, the opportunity to properly secure this island has arrived, and may find use as a stepping stone both into Taychend, and islands rumoured to exist to the east.* | <li>treasury is at least 50</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -50</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>If does not have a colony, and does not have city:</li><ul><li>2513:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>change culture = ROOT</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has owns is 2513:</li><ul><li>2513:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = 2513</li></ul><li>define explorer:</li><ul><li>name = "Elrianes Phouskarnaki"</li><li>shock = 2</li><li>fire = 3</li><li>manuever = 4</li><li>siege = 2</li></ul><li>define explorer:</li><ul><li>name = "Istradora Phouskarnaki"</li><li>female = yes</li><li>shock = 3</li><li>fire = 2</li><li>manuever = 4</li><li>siege = 2</li></ul> | [A Rising State](#G52_rising_state)<br /> |

This is because while the average Devandi had less than the average Taychendi, they were relatively happier with their way of life before our arrival.\n\nBut we did not allow them to stagnate in their comfort.
