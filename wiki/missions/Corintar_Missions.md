| <a name="corintar_the_fields_of_burnoll">The Fields of Burnoll</a><br />*Burnoll is not much to behold: green grass, trees, a few nascent farms. But under that earth is buried a considerable legacy. It is where Castan the Progenitor defeated the Xhazobine, the gnollish horde burned away with silver fire, and a new nation was born from its ashes.\n\nOur patron is Corin, not Castellos, and we are all entrusted with the responsibility of continuing her work, rather than leaving it to a distant silver dragon. But seeing these fields grow, a land that has known rivers of blood — and mountains of ash — now learning peace and prosperity marks a suitable start for our own work just the same.* | <li>burnoll area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>burnoll area:</li><ul><li>type is any</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>If themin area does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>burnoll area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>If random owned province has area is burnoll area, and  has fort level is 2:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>corintar refresh reconstruction = yes</li> | [Grannvale Recruits](#corintar_grannvale_recruits)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_corinite_riders">Corinite Riders</a><br />*I never liked horses. And they never liked me. Or Arosha. Or Creekwhistle. Thankfully, the Circle had little in the way of mounts when stuck behind enemy lines, though I know Sir Cecil missed the feeling of a good charge."\n-A brief aside in the memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nSome have interpreted this passage, and Corin's own style of fighting, as proof the Corintar should shun cavalry altogether. In truth, such steeds will be necessary, whether it be for messengers to keep knit our lands as they slowly heal or a rapid-response force to meet orcish raids. Resettling Themin and reclaiming the lands' scattered herds will give us adequate stock to draw upon.* | <li>themin area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>themin area:</li><ul><li>type is any</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul><li>num of cavalry is at least 8</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is livestock</li><li>has building farm_estate</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has trade goods is livestock, and  has building is farm estate:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier corintar_corinite_riders for 80 years</li><li>corintar refresh reconstruction = yes</li> | [The Fields of Burnoll](#corintar_the_fields_of_burnoll)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_aid_from_anbennar">Aid From Anbennar</a><br />*Evil knows no borders. Neither does your cause, nor your destiny." -Dominic of Gallowspeak, to Corin, in their conversations about her resurrection.\n\nTo the west, the Empire of Anbennar stands tall, the place where Corin's blade was sharpened and her skills honed. It proclaims unity, but goodness without action means nothing — we must ensure they take up her work with vigor.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>hre size is at least 1</li><li>is religion enabled is corinite</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>has global flag [crimson_deluge](../flags/crimson_deluge.md)</li></ul><li>prestige is at least 25</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>hre size is at least 1</li><li>is religion enabled is corinite</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>emperor</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all elector:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>hre size is at least 1</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>emperor</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all elector:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>prestige is at least 25</li></ul> | <li>If has hre size is 1, and does not have AND has emperor has religion is regent court; and AND has global flag is [crimson_deluge](../flags/crimson_deluge.md):</li><ul><li>add treasury = 400</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul><li>If has calc true if has all elector has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 150; and calc true if has amount is 3:</li><ul><li>If every elector has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 150:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier corintar_corintar_chapter until otherwise removed</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [corintar_chapter](../flags/corintar_chapter.md)</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier corintar_corintar_chapter until otherwise removed</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [corintar_chapter](../flags/corintar_chapter.md)</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul></ul></ul> | [Envoy to the Borders](#corintar_envoy_to_the_borders)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_return_of_the_farmers">Return of the Farmers</a><br />*Corin left her ruined farm town in Eswall, only to return to Escann a heroine — and more. We must not expect the same transformation from every returning refugee. It will be enough for the people who know the land best to tend it once more, and see it grow lush and verdant under their care.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>has building farm_estate</li><li>base production is at least 6</li></ul><li>amount is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>If oldhaven area does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier corintar_farmland_boom for 20 years</li><li>custom tooltip = corintar_fort_manpower_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>corintar fort manpower = yes</li><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>clr province flag [corintar_flag](../flags/corintar_flag.md)</li></ul></ul> | [Aid From Anbennar](#corintar_aid_from_anbennar)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_clear_the_woods">Clear the Woods</a><br />*Most Escanni shun Oldhaven, speaking in hushed tones of a generations-old curse. Even those that stayed would speak of a land that seemed to fight back against its inhabitants.\n\nBut we are not most Escanni. We are the Corintar, and we do not shy from evil. We will clear these haunted woods and banish whatever lingering shadows remain.* | <li>oldhaven area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>religion is corinite</li><li>development is at least 10</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>oldhaven area:</li><ul><li>type is any</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>oldhaven area:</li><ul><li>type is any</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is wine</li><li>trade goods  is grain</li><li>trade goods   is livestock</li></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li></ul> | <li>If blademarch area does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>874:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>If has oldhaven area has type is any, and does not have manufactory trigger is yes; and has trade goods is wine, and has trade goods is grain, and has trade goods is livestock:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>If oldhaven area does not have manufactory trigger is yes; and has trade goods is wine, and has trade goods is grain, and has trade goods is livestock:</li><ul><li>add building = farm_estate</li></ul></ul> | [Return of the Farmers](#corintar_return_of_the_farmers)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_enchanted_rain">Corin's Blessing</a><br />*How does she speak to us? She doesn't. She has already told us everything that needed saying, gave all the guidance we would need. Now it's on us to protect and strike true."\n-Lothane Bluetusk\n\nNone would argue with the sentiment of Bluetusk's teachings, but a torrential downpour of crimson rain was certainly more direct of a message than any would predict. Even now that the Deluge is passed, its message and impact lingers on. Its divine magic has seeped into the soil itself, Corin's blessing to her land and people, and all we require is a simple ritual to unlock its potential.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is corintar_deluge_is_over_tt</li><li>has global flag [crimson_deluge_is_over](../flags/crimson_deluge_is_over.md)</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has estate estate_mages</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 20</li></ul><li>mage tower is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>If has estate is estate mages:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = corintar_free_plant_growth_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has province with farm goods is yes:</li><ul><li>If has ROOT has estate influence has estate is estate mages, and estate influence has influence is 66:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_3</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has ROOT has estate influence has estate is estate mages, and estate influence has influence is 33:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_2</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_1</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = 0.5</li></ul> | [Clear the Woods](#corintar_clear_the_woods)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_rise_of_new_cities">Rise of New Cities</a><br />*From camp to small hamlet, from hamlet to walled village, and from village to thriving city — the new political and cultural centers of Escann may someday rival great Castonath itself.\n\nThough Corin is Mistress of War, the cities flourishing in our land show that in her wake, there is a deep and lasting prosperity. With her light shining bright, and all darkness banished, we grow and thrive and prosper.* | <li>adm tech is at least 16</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain farmlands</li><li>has terrain  grasslands</li></ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>religion is corinite</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is glass</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>trade goods is cloth</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>trade goods is paper</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>trade goods is dyes</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has terrain is farmlands, and has terrain is grasslands; and  has development is 30, and  has religion is corinite, and does not have trade goods is glass; and does not have trade goods is cloth; and does not have trade goods is paper; and does not have trade goods is dyes; and does not have trade goods is damestear; and does not have trade goods is gold:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = glass</li><li>add building = mills</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = corintar_influx_of_settlers</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has terrain is farmlands, and has terrain is grasslands; and  has development is 30, and  has religion is corinite, and does not have trade goods is glass; and does not have trade goods is cloth; and does not have trade goods is paper; and does not have trade goods is dyes; and does not have trade goods is damestear; and does not have trade goods is gold:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li><li>add building = mills</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = corintar_influx_of_settlers</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has terrain is farmlands, and has terrain is grasslands; and  has development is 30, and  has religion is corinite, and does not have trade goods is glass; and does not have trade goods is cloth; and does not have trade goods is paper; and does not have trade goods is dyes; and does not have trade goods is damestear; and does not have trade goods is gold:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = cloth</li><li>add building = textile</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = corintar_influx_of_settlers</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> | [Corin's Blessing](#corintar_enchanted_rain)<br />[The Corinsfall Decree](#corintar_the_corinsfall_decree)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_monastic_education">Monastic Education</a><br />*I learned more in one battle at Corin's side than in a decade at Nerat's temples. You will too."\n-Dominic of Gallowspeak\n\nFor most of the Corintar's history, even the most erudite of our members served as soldiers and generals simply as a matter of survival. Peace, and the simple prosperity it brings, has made that less of a guarantee. It is impossible to understand Corin's teachings without also knowing how to stand strong behind a shield, or how to wield a sword in pursuit of justice. We must codify our own curriculum to ensure new members learn these skills, even alongside Dominic's teachings and Bluetusk's memoirs.* | <li>has reform monastic_order_reform</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>religion is corinite</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has building university</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>amount is at least 6</li></ul><li>army tradition is at least 50</li> | <li>add adm power = 50</li><li>change innovativeness = 3</li><li>If has dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier corintar_martial_education until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier corintar_martial_education_nodlc until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [Rise of New Cities](#corintar_rise_of_new_cities)<br /> |

| <a name="corintar_grannvale_recruits">Grannvale Recruits</a><br />*An emissary has come from Grannvale, a small hamlet in Escerfork. The blue-haired half-elf, Seliff, is the son of the local baron, Sigurd, who ruled the area before the Greentide. Seliff served with the Marcher Lords, but struck out to Grannvale after the Battle of Castonath, seeking to rebuild his ancient home. Though he has made some progress, he claims that with our help the land could be made even brighter — and promises that for as long as his line rules, every man born in Grannvale will serve five years in the Corintar.\n\nThis brave soul is emblematic of Corin's fire itself — let us see his plan through!* | <li>escerfork area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 6</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>escerfork area:</li><ul><li>type is any</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has ruler leader from this nation</li></ul> | <li>If burnoll area does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add yearly manpower = 1</li><li>corintar refresh reconstruction = yes</li> | [From Tents to Castles](#corintar_a_base_of_operations)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_marquis_of_the_north">Marquis of the North</a><br />*Long before Corin mustered the Marcher Lords, it was Arbaran that served as mustering-ground against the Sorcerer-King. Nowadays, the Marquis of Arbaran oversees northeastern border of the Empire of Anbennar, which places it on the border of the lands ravaged by the Greentide. They will thus be instrumental in rebuilding Escann, and we should draw upon our shared history to ensure they take that role with Corin’s values at heart (and that they send any fervent recruits our way, of course).* | <li>corintar establish chapter trigger:</li><ul><li>Country is Arbaran</li><li>capital is at least 349</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 100</li><li>corintar establish chapter effect:</li><ul><li>tag = A46</li><li>capital = 349</li><li>chapter = corintar_corintar_chapter</li><li>modifier = corintar_adventurer_grants</li></ul> | [Grannvale Recruits](#corintar_grannvale_recruits)<br />[Corintar Chapters](#corintar_corintar_chapters)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_envoy_to_the_borders">Envoy to the Borders</a><br />*The Anbennarian Marquisate of Arannen may be far to the south, but its location on the edge of Daravan’s Folly places it close to Bal Dostan, the southern entrance into Castanor. Because of this, it would be advantageous to establish a chapter there in order to ensure that this route is used to favour Corin’s followers.* | <li>corintar establish chapter trigger:</li><ul><li>Country is Arannen</li><li>capital is at least 904</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 200</li><li>corintar establish chapter effect:</li><ul><li>tag = A72</li><li>capital = 904</li><li>chapter = corintar_corintar_chapter</li><li>modifier = corintar_borderland_diplomacy</li></ul> | [Marquis of the North](#corintar_marquis_of_the_north)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_the_gawed_embassy">The Gawed Embassy</a><br />*Gawed has always been one of the major powers in Cannor, and even though its attention is currently focused elsewhere, it is located right on the border of the fractured Castanorian lands. Maintaining good relations with them is paramount to the success of the Corinite mission, and a permanent embassy is necessary to this end. Establishing further chapters in the lands around Gaweton will only serve to strengthen our influence in the region.* | <li>corintar establish chapter trigger:</li><ul><li>Country is Gawed</li><li>capital is at least 221</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 300</li><li>corintar establish chapter effect:</li><ul><li>tag = A13</li><li>capital = 221</li><li>chapter = corintar_corintar_chapter</li><li>modifier = corintar_alenic_migrants</li></ul> | [Envoy to the Borders](#corintar_envoy_to_the_borders)<br /> |
| <a name="corintar_chapter_recruits">Chapter Recruits</a><br />*Years ago, we watched as many of our faithful trickled out of our lands to set up chapters across Cannor.

I would go to the training fields and watch the new recruits train under Rethag and listen to Dominic's sermons. It wasn't much of a break, but it was enough. To shepherd these people who could not yet hold a sword into Corin's light — it was enough."\n-The memoirs of Lothane 'Bluetusk' Silmuna\n\nThe Corintar once again finds itself flush with recruits, ready to fight for Corin but liable to break at the first sign of real battle.

What was once a powerful institution respected across Cannor lost most of its talent and contacts when the chapters disbanded and the moderates in our administration were purged. With our zealotry tempered, it is time to rebuild Corintari diplomacy.* | <li>diplomat is at least 3</li><li>monthly dip is at least 10</li> | <li>country gets the modifier corintar_agents_in_training for 10 years</li> | [The Fate of Anbennar](#corintar_the_fate_of_anbennar)<br /> |

A land that was once blackened by fields of corpses is teeming with life. The fields bloom, the cities thrive, and the very river mentioned in Lothane's memoir is preserved as a holy site, so that all of the faithful in the Corintar may be reminded of the simple beauty that we have worked so hard to achieve.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is corintar_prosperous_tt</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 16</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>stability is at least 3</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>amount is at least 16</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>average unrest is -1</li></ul> | <li>add yearly manpower = 1</li><li>If has mission completed is corintar escann defended:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = corintar_reconstruction</li><li>remove country modifier = corintar_reconstruction_improved</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier corintar_reconstruction_permanent until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>corintar refresh reconstruction = yes</li><li>custom tooltip = corintar_escann_restored_tt</li></ul> | [Monastic Education](#corintar_monastic_education)<br />[Retrain Our Diplomats](#corintar_retrain_our_diplomats)<br /> |

Richer and more easily woven into cloth, it became the dye of choice for the local Redtusk community. In mere weeks, the woods across the Corintar were abuzz with loggers crushing Carmine Red. [Root.Capital.GetName] became an epicenter of the dye trade almost overnight, and Carmine Red is now bought and sold all across Cannor.\n\nToday, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] stands at his balcony and surveys the fruit of this discovery — eighty thousand soldiers stand before him, holding eighty thousand shields, each painted with the burning red insignia of the Corintar.* | <li>army size is at least 80</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain woods</li><li>has terrain  forest</li></ul><li>superregion is escann_superregion</li></ul><li>amount is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = dyes</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = corintar_carmine_red</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = corintar_woods_loss_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li><li>corintar deforestation = yes</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = corintar_redtusk_spread_fast_tt</li> | [Orcish Resurgence](#corintar_orcish_resurgence)<br /> |
