| <a name="yanzhong_wicked_coins">Wicked Coins</a><br />*Loathe as we are to admit, the League has grown complacent. The cities - our own included - have been all too willing to grow lax in the false belief that a united front would compensate for our own weaknesses. \n\nThe soldiers of Jinqiu were all too eager to demonstrate this weakness to us, and made off with the lands of Caoying for their trouble. If the League is to be restored, preparations must be made to reclaim those lost lands - and a touch more with them.* | <li>trade embargoing is Y02</li><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Y02</li><li>value is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>4851:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4852:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4975:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Bolster The Patrol](#yanzhong_patrol)<br /> |
| <a name="yanzhong_river_further">And A River Further</a><br />*The hills of Balrisen are a natural avenue of expansion for the League.

| <a name="yanzhong_mollify">Mollify The Subjects</a><br />*Much of the smallfolk in our newest acquisitions are rather tense in the wake of their change of lord. We cannot blame them, in truth. With the number of bloodthirsty warlords about they have every reason to be concerned. \n\nNonetheless, we must do something to demonstrate goodwill towards these people. The construction of new public builds would assist.* | <li>balrijin area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>num of times improved is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier yanzhong_mollify_mod for 5 years</li><li>medium increase of kobold tolerance effect = yes</li> | [And A River Further](#yanzhong_river_further)<br /> |

| <a name="yanzhong_patrol">Bolster The Patrol</a><br />*Yanzhong has no great port to the sea, and while the river provides a great deal of trade in its own right, our true lifeblood is the passage once known as the 'Golden Highway'. The maintenance of the route was perhaps the one positive to come of the elven conquest, but their sun has long since set on Yanshen. \n\nEven now, in its current disrepair, the road still hosts a great many merchants seeking to trade between the Raj and Tianlou. Yanszin has grown rich off of this trade, and no small part of that is a result of the Great Patrol. An organization dedicated to protecting our portion of the route, they have built for us a reputation that our stretch of the Highway is the safest in all the world. \n\nEven during the recent war with the state of Jinqiu, our men kept the road as safe as any other. It is paramount that we continue to set aside men to maintain the order.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>manpower is at least 5</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add manpower = -5</li><li>add government reform = yanzhong_patrol_reform</li> |  |
| <a name="yanzhong_uni">Invest In The University</a><br />*The scholars of Yangcheng have always enjoyed a particularly cordial relationship with our own government - to the point that many outsiders consider our states to be one and the same, rather than two members of the League. While none among our government or our military would ever condone violence against our bookish friends, the League's current weakness demands that some manner of changes be made. \n\nA contingent of officials and merchants have proposed a plan - one to dominate the rest of the league not by force but by coin. With tactical investments into their governments, businesses, and even militaries we may be able to leave the rest of the League even more reliant on our coin than they are now. Our friendship with Yangcheng puts us in a prime position to put the theory to the test.* | <li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y06</li><li>value is at least 170</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>custom tooltip = yanzhong_yangcheng_tt</li><li>set country flag [yanzhong_yangcheng_allow](../flags/yanzhong_yangcheng_allow.md)</li> | [Bolster The Patrol](#yanzhong_patrol)<br /> |
| <a name="yanzhong_funded">Well-Funded Army</a><br />*As efforts to sieze the economy of Yangcheng are underway, many within the government point to our neighbor Guhe as a prime secondary target. Their military already relies on our economy for much of their weaponry - increasing our reach just a little further should prove only a small trouble.* | <li>4859:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y07</li><li>value is at least 170</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>custom tooltip = yanzhong_guhe_tt</li><li>set country flag [yanzhong_guhe_allow](../flags/yanzhong_guhe_allow.md)</li> | [Invest In The University](#yanzhong_uni)<br />[The Anjiang Contract](#yanzhong_contract)<br /> |
| <a name="yanzhong_path">Restore The Path</a><br />*For all this time, our efforts have resulted primarily in the simple maintenance of the old Highway. Old stones still bear century-old cracks, and the worst of the road is often detoured by treacherous and muddy pathways. \n\nAs we begin to expand our influence over the rest of the League - and Yanshen itself - it grows more apparent that effort should be put into restoring the Highway itself. A great number of coin and men must be set aside, so that this road can once again reach the splendor of the old days.* | <li>4853:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4854:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4859:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4861:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>manpower is at least 5</li> | <li>the event [Yanzhong's Road](../events/yanzhong_s_road.md) happens</li><li>add treasury = -250</li><li>add manpower = -5</li><li>custom tooltip = yanzhong_path_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>4853:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = golden_highway</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4854:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = golden_highway</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4859:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = golden_highway</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4861:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = golden_highway</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Well-Funded Army](#yanzhong_funded)<br /> |
| <a name="yanzhong_standard">Yansheni Gold Standard</a><br />*Our lowest days are not far from the common memory. We were beset on all sides by rising powers, and licking our wounds after the losses of not only one of our sister-states but our defeat at the hands of the Jinqiu as well. \n\nSlowly, however, a light peeks over the horizon. Our darkest days grow further behind us. As our territory expands, the city of Yanzhong has grown in imprtance well beyond being but another stop on the road to Tianlou. We must continue to foster this growth - until we have eclipsed not only the city at the sea, but all others along this great highway.* | <li>4859:</li><ul><li>has most province trade power this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier yanzhong_golden for 10 years</li><li>set country flag [yanzhong_pulse](../flags/yanzhong_pulse.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = yanzhong_pulse_tt</li> | [Restore The Path](#yanzhong_path)<br />[Mollify The Subjects](#yanzhong_mollify)<br /> |

| <a name="yanzhong_contract">The Anjiang Contract</a><br />*Zealots with a penchant for knowing the future - what greater frustration might one be put against? \n\nAnjiang has, thus far, rebuked our efforts to exert even the smallest economic influence over them. Businesses facing weakness find themselves invested in by the local government mere days before we can do the same, and as of late they have enjoyed an uncanny economic boom. \n\nOur advisors suggest that a new plan must be drafted, but a young member of the court has suggested a more dire plan of action. Supposedly, should Anjiang find itself facing some great crisis, our forces could simply march in under the guise of 'peace-keeping', so taking the land for ourselves. * | <li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y10</li><li>value is at least 130</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>Y10:</li><ul><li>the event [An Offer From Yanzhong](../events/an_offer_from_yanzhong.md) happens</li></ul> | [Bolster The Patrol](#yanzhong_patrol)<br /> |
| <a name="yanzhong_prudence">A Matter of Prudence</a><br />*We may never know how exactly the agents of Yingzhen were able to avoid the foresight of the Anjiang, but we are grateful for it. Nonetheless - we now find ourselves in a great position over them. Beset by foes on all sides, what choice do they have but to bend the knee, when the time comes?* | <li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y10</li><li>value is at least 130</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>custom tooltip = yanzhong_yingzhen_tt</li><li>set country flag [yanzhong_yingzhen_allow](../flags/yanzhong_yingzhen_allow.md)</li> | [The Anjiang Contract](#yanzhong_contract)<br /> |
