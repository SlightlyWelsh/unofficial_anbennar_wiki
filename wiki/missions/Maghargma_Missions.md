| <a name="maghargma_bolster_warband">Bolster the Warband</a><br />*Our warriors have become lazy and complacent, many have abandoned the warbands to gorge themselves on the fruits of other's labor. We must end this trend and force them back into our military if we wish to regain our former glory.* | <li>army size is at least 15</li> | <li>country gets the modifier bolstered_military for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="maghargma_enforcing_rule">Enforcing our Rule</a><br />*The power of our throne is still questioned by many of our subjects, who point towards the centuries of stagnation and neglect our forefathers enabled through their apathetic and hedonistic reigns as evidence of our illegitimate rule. We must bring these treasonous fiends to heel, and prove our might.* | <li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>prestige is at least 40</li> | <li>country gets the modifier enforcing_our_rule for 25 years</li> | [Bolster the Warband](#maghargma_bolster_warband)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_rein_the_north">Rein in the North</a><br />*As our realm sank deeper into decadence the furthest northern reaches of our Kingdom took the opportunity to break away from the crown. Far to the north are wild and traitorous clans, long time enemies of our people, and just south of them are the warlords that pay little more than lip service to their rightful liege. Through a great show of strength we can finally bring our errant subjects back into the fold.* | <li>total development is at least 65</li><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Iltklerd</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Kvakolba</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Olkhajukh</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Remlygenjrot</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Achtejardon</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Garsvulshim</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>If has exists is J38:</li><ul><li>vassalize = J38</li></ul><li>If has exists is J39:</li><ul><li>vassalize = J39</li></ul><li>If has exists is J40:</li><ul><li>vassalize = J40</li></ul><li>5019:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>5020:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>5021:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>5022:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>5005:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>5024:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Enforcing our Rule](#maghargma_enforcing_rule)<br /> |

| <a name="maghargma_the_rock">Conquering the Rock</a><br />*The domain of the Strongrock clan, Iltklerd, has long been the Kingdom's shield against the roaming centaurs. In the ancient past, many great battles were fought in their lands to defend our people, though with the start of the tributary system these conflicts slowly came to an end. The Strongrocks have slowly been pulling away from Maghargma's rule, confident that the strength of their walls would keep the hordes at bay, up until they were slaughtered by the treacherous centaurs and crawled back to their liege for protection.\n\nNow, as we pursue a grander future, we must bring their lands back under our sway, and ensure they shall never break away again.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Iltklerd</li></ul><li>owns core province 5039</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>5039:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="maghargma_east_fortify">Fortifying the East</a><br />*Our walls to the east have fallen into disrepair and ruin, victims of our ancestor's sloth and the centaur's wrath.

| <a name="maghargma_break_the_spine">Breaking the Spine</a><br />*The Spinebreaker clan of Remlygenjrot is renowned as the cruelest and most brutal in all of Maghargma, the leaders of numerous rebellions against the first of our kings and feared throughout the Kingdom. They were among the first to denounce our throne, choosing to reign their lands with a bloody fist. Though crude and merciless, it would be to our great benefit to finally bring these monsters to kneel.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Remlygenjrot</li></ul><li>owns core province 5043</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>5043:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="maghargma_subjugate_warlords">Subjugating the Warlords</a><br />*We have finally enforced our will upon our closest warlords, the Strongrock, Stoneheart, and Steelgrinder clans. With the backing of our loyal vassals, we can now devote our attentions to reining in our disobedient lords and the barbarians in the north.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Iltklerd</li></ul><li>owns core province 5039</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Kvakolba</li></ul><li>owns core province  5035</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Olkhajukh</li></ul><li>owns core province   5322</li> | <li>5037:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="maghargma_clan_reform">Negotiating with the Clans</a><br />*As we seek greater things for our Kingdom we must choose how much power we grant to the clans that rule over our people in the name of Maghargma, and how much should stay with the throne.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 7</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>region is ogre_mountains_region</li></ul> | <li>5037:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 10</li></ul></ul><li>the event [The Place of the Clans](../events/the_place_of_the_clans.md) happens</li> | [Lord of the Ogres](#maghargma_ogrelord)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_new_kelaktar">Building new Kelaktar</a><br />*As we expand into the plains we've found a need to construct new fortified cities, Kelaktar, to watch over our rowdy new subjects and ensure their loyalty. These new Kelaktar may not be quite as grand or imposing as those closer to home, but their will stand as symbols of our might nonetheless.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is west_forbidden_plains_region</li><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has region is west forbidden plains region, and  has fort building trigger is yes, and  has development is 20:</li><ul><li>change culture = fathide_ogre</li><li>change religion = feast_of_the_gods</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = plains_kelaktar</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Conquer the Horsemen](#maghargma_conquer_the_horsemen)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_ogre_steppe">The Ogre Steppes</a><br />*With prosperity abound within our heartlands and even in the new conquests, our citizens have gathered around the nascent Kelaktar in the east, creating new Ogre communities in the plains. As the Centaurs are gradually pushed away from our trade routes on pain of ending up in our maws, we are slowly creating an Ogrish steppe.* | <li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 200</li><li>region is west_forbidden_plains_region</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has province modifier is plains kelaktar:</li><ul><li>area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = the_ogre_steppes</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Building new Kelaktar](#maghargma_new_kelaktar)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_slave_market">Grand Slave Markets</a><br />*Despite the best efforts of our warriors, many centaurs still try to pillage our lands, becoming captured in the process. With our prison camps overflowing, our wealthiest slavers have begun buying and auctioning them from the safety of the largest Kelaktar in the plains. With new wealth pouring into our treasury from these markets, we've gone ahead and formally appointed these Kelaktar as the primary slave entrepots within our expanded dominion.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>has province modifier plains_kelaktar</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If west forbidden plains region has fort building trigger is yes, and  has province modifier is plains kelaktar, and  has development is 30:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = grand_slave_market</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Ogre Steppes](#maghargma_ogre_steppe)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_the_gift">Seizing the Gift</a><br />*Long ago Ogres ruled the southern reaches of the Plains, stalking the desert hills mountains, and building great forts along the river. They called themselves the Sandmaw Ogres, and they were wiped out when famine struck them due to the Day of Ashen Skies. Now, as we secure a dominant position within these lands, we must return to the lands of our lost brethren and seize the lands stolen from them by the Centaur menace.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is serpent_gift_region</li></ul> | <li>If serpent gift region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Grand Slave Markets](#maghargma_slave_market)<br /> |

| <a name="maghargma_the_river">Down the River</a><br />*Prosperous Kvakolba, home of the Stoneheart clan, has always been the most loyal of our subjects, guarding the passage to our capital and ferrying wealth to our walls. Nevertheless, they too have enjoyed far too many liberties in recent centuries, and they should be reminded that we are their liege, and not their friend.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Kvakolba</li></ul><li>owns core province 5035</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>5035:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="maghargma_riverstone">Market of Riverstone</a><br />*As the Kvakolba returns to its rightful position as the center of our Kingdom's trade network, a great market has been founded in the heart of the city as caravans stop behind the city's walls to rest and prepare themselves to enter the royal capital. We should support the growth of this bazaar, as it would only benefit us.* | <li>5035:</li><ul><li>development is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>5035:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = riverstone</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Down the River](#maghargma_the_river)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_taking_the_chains">Taking the Chains</a><br />*Safe from centaur hordes, northern warbands, and, annoyingly, royal taxmen, Achtejardon is the center of slavery within Maghargma, with countless auctions being held every day. The city is run by the wealthiest slavers, the Chainlord clan, who rule their lands from their opulent palace, using their most trusted servants to enforce their will. They view themselves above our throne. We will prove them wrong.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Achtejardon</li></ul><li>owns core province 5028</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>5028:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="maghargma_empower_slavers">Empower the Slavers</a><br />*Much as we are loathe to admit it, our people are notoriously lazy. Unless it benefits them directly or they have a whip to their backs, Ogres are very slow to undertake menial labor. With the slavers of Achtejardon under our thumb for the first time in centuries, we have a new source of cheap and "motivated" labor to work in our fields, mines, and workshops.* | <li>5028:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier empowered_slavers until otherwise removed</li> | [Taking the Chains](#maghargma_taking_the_chains)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_integrating_the_north">Integrating the North</a><br />*The treasonous lords of the north have finally bent the knee to our throne, bringing great prosperity to our capital and the Kingdom as a whole. The last obstacle to our unity is now the northern forest tribes that have harassed our realm for eons.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Remlygenjrot</li></ul><li>owns core province 5043</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Achtejardon</li></ul><li>owns core province  5028</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Garsvulshim</li></ul><li>owns core province   5026</li> | <li>5037:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="maghargma_ogrelord">Lord of the Ogres</a><br />*We have experienced a grand resurgence, bringing unity and prosperity to the land and prestige to our throne. Our warriors are hardened and ready for battle while our feasting halls are packed, supplied with the bounty of our realm. We must now look to the future, and work to reform our obsolete traditions into that of a modern Kingdom.* | <li>ogre mountains region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>add stability = 2</li><li>5037:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 35</li></ul></ul> | [Subjugating the Warlords](#maghargma_subjugate_warlords)<br />[Integrating the North](#maghargma_integrating_the_north)<br />[Taming the Tribes](#maghargma_taming_the_tribes)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_land_reform">Dividing the Lands</a><br />*Our territory is vast, and neither we nor the clans can properly rule over them, forcing us to rely on local officials to rule over our cities, villages, and other far away lands. We must choose how these officials are chosen.* | <li>total development is at least 200</li> | <li>5037:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 10</li></ul></ul><li>the event [Owners of the Land](../events/owners_of_the_land.md) happens</li> | [Lord of the Ogres](#maghargma_ogrelord)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_supreme_ogrelord">Become the Mengurkha</a><br />*The title of Mengurkha, Ruler of Ogres, has been the true title of our King for eons, though many claim that we have not deserved such a distinguished position. Through great effort and luck, we have finally crawled out of the rotten pits of stagnation to reaffirm the power of Maghargma, and of the Ogre people. Now, as we move towards a brighter future, we need a crown to match our glory, to be placed upon the Mengurkha in a grand ceremony not witnessed in more than a thousand years.* | <li>has institution feudalism</li><li>years of income is at least 1</li> | <li>add prestige = 30</li><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add government reform = mengotsa</li><li>set government rank = 3</li><li>country gets the modifier united_mengotsa for 50 years</li><li>If caubheameas area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ugheabar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If naglaibar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If foirakhian area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Negotiating with the Clans](#maghargma_clan_reform)<br />[Dividing the Lands](#maghargma_land_reform)<br />[Organizing the Warriors](#maghargma_military_reform)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_conquer_the_horsemen">Conquer the Horsemen</a><br />*Now that we have risen from squalor we should now devote our attention towards the treacherous Centaurs to the east. While we should thank them for giving us the shock we needed to pull our realm out of stagnation, their betrayal cannot be forgotten, nor can it be forgiven. The warriors of the Mengotsa are ready to charge into the plains and feast upon the flesh of those that sought to conquer our lands and enslave our people!* | <li>caubheameas area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>ugheabar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>naglaibar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>foirakhian area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If west forbidden plains region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add prestige = 20</li> | [Become the Mengurkha](#maghargma_supreme_ogrelord)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_the_ogre_missive">The Blackhand Missive</a><br />*As we wage our campaign of vengeance and expansion across the plains we have come into contact with a thriving land full of puny humans, gathered into a so called "Federation" for their own protection. They are clearly incapable of defending themselves, we shall send them a missive demanding their subservience in return for our protection. Those that refuse shall be brought to kneel by force.* | <li>army size is at least 120</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>province group is triunic_crescent</li></ul><li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>has country modifier lake_federation_member</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Human Response](../events/the_human_response.md) happens</li><li>If every country has country modifier is lake federation member:</li><ul><li>the event [The Blackhand Missive](../events/the_blackhand_missive.md) happens</li></ul> | [Conquer the Horsemen](#maghargma_conquer_the_horsemen)<br /> |

The great wealth of the Lakes are now being siphoned towards our heartlands, bringing great wealth and prosperity to our people, even if the puny men of the Lakes must suffer.* | <li>northern isles region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>southern isles region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 50</li><li>peenadhi area:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = I90</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 50</li><li>key = lake_ogre</li></ul></ul><li>prikoyol area:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = I90</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 50</li><li>key = lake_ogre</li></ul></ul><li>yuurarila area:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = I90</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 50</li><li>key = lake_ogre</li></ul></ul><li>keshkoi area:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = I90</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 50</li><li>key = lake_ogre</li></ul></ul> | [The Blackhand Missive](#maghargma_the_ogre_missive)<br /> |

| <a name="maghargma_steel_wall">The Valley of Steel</a><br />*Nestled within the cool embrace of a massive valley, Olkhajukh produces the vast majority of the Kingdom's weaponry. For centuries this was traded to the centaurs in return for tribute, however with the betrayal of those bastard horsemen we need all the quality steel we can get. The Steelgrinders, long safe within the confines of their rocky walls, must know the might of our throne.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Olkhajukh</li></ul><li>owns core province 5322</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>5322:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |

It almost instantly became the center of our civilization, a shining beacon of our power.\n\nCenturies of stagnation and neglect have taken their toll on the city however; the once great and magnificent walls are crumbled and stained.

They've gathered around the most popular feasting halls, bringing their retinues with them and establishing a bustling market within the heart of our city.

| <a name="maghargma_mining_hills">Mine the Hills</a><br />*Maghargma is half buried into the mountains surrounding it, evidence of the cataclysmic crash that brought the city into our hands and its deceased inhabitants to our plates. Long ago, we mined the mountains for a variety of ores and precious gems, though years of neglect led to several of the tunnels collapsing and never opening again. Now, as we seek new wealth to support our Kingdom, we must reopen the mines of Maghargma and see what remains within the earth around us.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>the event [Mining in Maghargma](../events/mining_in_maghargma.md) happens</li> | [Great Clan Halls](#maghargma_clan_halls)<br /> |
| <a name="maghargma_great_maghargma">Palace of the Devoured Gods</a><br />*The royal city of Maghargma is experiencing such grand prosperity unseen for centuries, as clans clash and feast within the halls and wealth flows from the hills around us. Now, we have constructed the centerpiece of our newly refurbished capital, a massive palace carved into the mountain and decorated with hundreds of statues and effigies constructed out of bone, granite, bronze, and many more.\n\nThe greatest work within the palace also acts as its namesake; an authentic Cloud Giant skeleton with a skin of steel and gems looks over the dining hall, a reminder of where we gained our power from. The Palace of the Devoured Gods now holds the great throne of our Kingdom, and is a clear sign of our supremacy.* | <li>5037:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>5037:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = maghargma_2</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = maghargma_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul> | [Mine the Hills](#maghargma_mining_hills)<br /> |
