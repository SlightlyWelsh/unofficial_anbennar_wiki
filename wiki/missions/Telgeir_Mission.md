| <a name="telgeir_own_gabmorionn_yearncliff">Border Disputes</a><br />*Before Tristan of Vanbury was bestowed Telgeir and surrounds for his efforts in arming the Empire during the Lilac Wars, our land was disputed between the lords of Esmaria like Gabmórionn. We have always been seen as outsiders in Esmaria, and land disputes between us and the south are as frequent as the steel pouring into our foundries... until now. Yearncliff yearns for us, and an old and decrepit lady rules Gabmórionn. The time of Telgeir has come.* | <li>260:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>264:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If ryalanar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Telgeiran Standing Army](#telgeir_full_fl)<br /> |

| <a name="telgeir_buyout_of_esmaraine">Buyout of Esmarainé</a><br />*Ever since the Grand Duchy of Esmaria was dissolved in 1365, the greedy merchants profiting of the Esmar have taken control of the once great capital of the region.\n\nTheir greed can be used against them, however, and the coffers of the Vanbury Guild never disappoints.* | <li>267:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>575:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>A44:</li><ul><li>exists</li><li>owns 266</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>dip power is at least 250</li></ul><li>A44:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owns 266</li></ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has A44 has exists, and A44 has owns is 266, and A44 is controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -250</li><li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>add corruption = 5</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every core province is core is A44:</li><ul><li>set province flag [vanbury_esmaraine_flag](../flags/vanbury_esmaraine_flag.md)</li></ul></ul><li>inherit = A44</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province is core is A44:</li><ul><li>If does not have province flag is [vanbury_esmaraine_flag](../flags/vanbury_esmaraine_flag.md):</li><ul><li>remove core = ROOT</li><li>If does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>clr province flag [vanbury_esmaraine_flag](../flags/vanbury_esmaraine_flag.md)</li></ul></ul></ul><li>266:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = telgeir_buyout_of_esmaraine_mod</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>266:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul><li>263:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>268:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>270:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Conquer Temple Lands](#telgeir_own_rayalanar)<br /> |

| <a name="telgeir_return_to_vanbury">Return to Vanbury</a><br />*After the Greatwood Uprising the House of Vanbury were banished from their ancestral lands, and with it the prosperity of their home province, Vanbury began to dwindle. While the Baldfather Kings attempted to keep their profitable steel foundries and armouries open it never reached its previous wealth and simply became just one of the cities along the Alen... until now.\n\nWith a Vanbury on the throne once more we can make Vanbury the true capital Gawed deserves: rip the curtains and sell the gaudy trinkets of the Baldfather and Gerwick kings, and move the court and its riches to Vanbury!* | <li>221:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>222:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>221:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -3</li><li>add base production = -3</li><li>add base manpower = -3</li></ul><li>222:</li><ul><li>If does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li></ul><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>remove core = A13</li><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = vanbury_steel_foundry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = telgeir_urban_development</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul><li>center of trade = 2</li><li>move capital effect = yes</li></ul> | [The Throne of Gawed](#telgeir_restore_vanbury_to_gawed)<br /> |

| <a name="telgeir_own_aranmas">Own Aranmas</a><br />*To prevent dependency on food from the lords of Esmaria like Asheniande, Telgeir traditionally buys their produce from downriver rather than up, hoping to avoid any sort of blockade on much-needed supplies. While we were allies during the Fourth Lilac War, Aranmas has increased tariffs on much needed grain, forcing us into seizing the means of production for ourselves.* | <li>262:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If heartland borders area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Telgeiran Standing Army](#telgeir_full_fl)<br /> |
| <a name="telgeir_own_heartland_border">The Heartland Borders</a><br />*At the very edge of Esmaria lies a dangerous choke-point: the borders between the Imperial Heartlands and the Alenic Frontier.\n\nThe elven castle of Calascandar stands proud at the borders, challenging any would-be attacker to brave its defenses and risk being caught between mountain and sea. If we are to rise as a great power in Anbennarian politics we must secure this castle and surrounds, no matter the cost.* | <li>heartland borders area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If damescrown area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Own Aranmas](#telgeir_own_aranmas)<br /> |
| <a name="telgeir_own_damescrown">Conquest of Damescrown</a><br />*With the natural flow of the river, many of our wares make their way down trade barges to the city of Damescrown, where they are then sold to clients all over the world - indeed, the largest branch of the Vanbury Guild even resides there.\n\nBut enough is enough! Long have the greedy merchants of Damescrown taken larger and larger percentages of our profits, so maybe we remove the middleman once and for all?* | <li>damescrown area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier rush_of_merchants for 20 years</li> | [The Heartland Borders](#telgeir_own_heartland_border)<br /> |
| <a name="telgeir_large_army">Vanbury Royal Army</a><br />*Blades have been rattled, and the rise of the Telgeiran State is nigh. We must create a formidable army to challenge even the Marquisate of Arbaran - and after we have hegemony of the northern reaches of the Empire, we will be able to act with impunity for our true ambitions.* | <li>army size is at least 50</li><li>legitimacy is at least 100</li> | <li>If derwing area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If golden plains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If cestir area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If arbaran area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Conquest of Damescrown](#telgeir_own_damescrown)<br /> |
| <a name="telgeir_restore_vanbury_to_gawed">The Throne of Gawed</a><br />*With the extinction of the royal house of Gawe in 1152, the throne went their cadet family, the House of Vanbury. However, Ricard of Vanbury, the claimant to the throne, was also the son of a Siloriel of Lorent, the principal rivals of Gawed. This sparked a war of succession, with Ricard aided by the nominal 'Ioriellan Empire' (Lorent and its sphere of influence under Ioriel) against the anti-Iorielist forces (much of Gawed), who was secretly being funded by Jexis, the Empress of the Phoenix Empire.\n\nThe war ended in 1162 with Ricard claiming the throne, and was eventually known as a liberal and modernizing figure - always striving to integrate Gawed with the new elvenized way of things... until we were deposed by the uncivilized anti-elf brutes of the House of Baldfather during the Greatwood Uprising of 1170, two years after Ioriel's death.* | <li>derwing area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>golden plains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>cestir area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>arbaran area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A13</li><li>type = cb_restore_personal_union</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>If alenic expanse area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south alen area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If gawed area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If vertesk area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Vanbury Royal Army](#telgeir_large_army)<br /> |
