| <a name="A93_develop_estallen">Develop Estallen</a><br />*Estallen has often been called the greatest city of southern Esmaria - yet, it could be far grander! We must invest in urban development to reach the full potential of our illustrious capital.* | <li>280:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>280:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A93_secrets_of_silk">Secrets of Silk</a><br />*The elves of the Redglades produce a fine fabric known as 'silk', which is wildly popular amongst our clothiers and designers. Surely our most beautiful elven courtesan could seduce the secrets of this fabric out of one of their experts...* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A03:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>PREV</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Redglades</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Redglades</li></ul></ul> | <li>280:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add center of trade level = 1</li><li>change trade goods = silk</li></ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = A03</li><li>value = -40</li></ul><li>A03:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = PREV</li><li>value = -40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Develop Estallen](#A93_develop_estallen)<br /> |
| <a name="A93_ramp_up_silk">Produce More Silk</a><br />*Our acquisition of silk has seen record-breaking profits for our fashion industry, yet our limited supply has held us back from cornering the market! We must increase our production of silk to truly dominate the fashion scene of Cannor.* | <li>280:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>development is at least 40</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>280:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "estalleni_silks"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Secrets of Silk](#A93_secrets_of_silk)<br /> |
| <a name="A93_mercenary_relations">Mercenary Relations</a><br />*We have many ties to the mercenary companies of Cannor, and it would be for the best if we cultivated these. An effort to solidify these ties, and forge new ones where possible, would enable us to hire mercenaries on a far more reasonable budget than others.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier "estalleni_mercenary_relations" for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A93_new_pinklady_band">New Pinklady Band</a><br />*Of all the mercenaries we keep in contact with, it is the Pinklady Band that is our most loyal friend. Ferocious in battle, yet somewhat prone to battlefield excesses, the Pinklady Band is certainly mighty - but, were we to provide them with modern technologies, they could be a true force to be reckoned with.* | <li>mil tech is at least 8</li> | <li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_reformed_pinklady_band</li></ul> | [Mercenary Relations](#A93_mercenary_relations)<br /> |

| <a name="A93_song_of_victory">Song of Victory</a><br />*The city of Seinathíl is small and weak, yet its people are fierce warriors and delightful bards. Such a small nation has little chance of survival and so, for their own good, we must take control of Seinathíl and incorporate their bards and warsingers into our army.* | <li>songbarges area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If hearthswood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Pursuing Our Claims](#A93_standing_army)<br /> |
| <a name="A93_lovers_of_ryala">Lovers of Ryala</a><br />*As with many other western Esmari, we worship the goddess of love, Ryala, just as much as her mother, Esmaryal, the goddess of fertility and family. With the fall of the Grand Duchy of Esmaria, it is our duty to unite the Ryalan territories under ourselves to protect our people from potential heresy.* | <li>konwell area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>ryalanar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If upper luna area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If the commons area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "lovers_of_ryala" for 20 years</li> | [Loot Leslinpár](#A93_loot_leslinpar)<br /> |

| <a name="A93_standing_army">Pursuing Our Claims</a><br />*The Grand Duchies of Dameria and Esmaria have both collapsed following the Lilac Wars. A period of such chaos gives us excellent opportunities to pursue our claims and perhaps solidify ourselves as the true successors of the síl Esmarainé dynasty, above the country yokels of the síl Leslinpár and glorified stewards of the síl Themarenn dynasties. To do this, of course, will require an army.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li> | <li>If songbarges area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>301:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="A93_minor_nuisance">A Minor Nuisance</a><br />*The very existence of the county of Terr is a joke. They occupy nothing but a small forest and some farmlands, in two completely different parts of Esmaria. We must grant this laughingstock of Esmaria a merciful death.* | <li>301:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>901:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>302:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>309:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Pursuing Our Claims](#A93_standing_army)<br /> |
| <a name="A93_loot_leslinpar">Loot Leslinpár</a><br />*The duchy of Leslinpár is our greatest rival - or was. Now that we've occupied their city, we can ensure this state of affairs shall never return by looting everything not nailed down and bringing it back home.* | <li>owns core province 901</li><li>owns core province  302</li><li>owns core province   309</li><li>hearthswood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>280:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 4</li><li>add base production = 4</li><li>add base manpower = 4</li></ul><li>901:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -4</li><li>add base production = -4</li><li>add base manpower = -4</li></ul><li>If esmaria region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Song of Victory](#A93_song_of_victory)<br />[A Minor Nuisance](#A93_minor_nuisance)<br /> |
| <a name="A93_children_of_esmaryal">Children of Esmaryal</a><br />*Esmaria is, of course, the country of Esmaryal, goddess of family and fertility - and like a family, it must be kept together, even if it requires disciplining some members. We must take the core regions of the old Grand Duchy for ourselves, lest another takes first.* | <li>cann esmar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If heartland borders area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "children_of_esmaryal" for 20 years</li> | [Loot Leslinpár](#A93_loot_leslinpar)<br /> |
| <a name="A93_imperial_heart">The Imperial Heart</a><br />*Having reunited Esmaria, and expanding it to new borders, we can firmly say that we are the true heart of the empire - this would be an excellent boost to our authority should we be elected to the position of Emperor.* | <li>heartland borders area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>upper luna area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>the commons area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>wexhills area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>ashfields area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "estallen_imperial_heartland" until otherwise removed</li> | [Lovers of Ryala](#A93_lovers_of_ryala)<br />[Children of Esmaryal](#A93_children_of_esmaryal)<br />[Heirs of Balgar](#A93_heirs_of_balgar)<br /> |

| <a name="A93_lovely_ladies_of_estallen">Our Lovely Ladies</a><br />*Estallen is known for its courtesans, who hold such respect that they are often handmaidens for our princesses. With such tutors, our ladies are well known for their ability to influence their spouses, which could be neatly leveraged to expand diplomatically.* | <li>personal union is at least 3</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "estalleni_courtesans" for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A93_value_of_friendship">Value of Friendship</a><br />*Having friends can be quite useful, especially in the chaos after the Lilac Wars. It would be best to cultivate as many connections as we can.* | <li>num of allies is at least 7</li> | <li>every ally:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = 40</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="A93_halfling_dye">Our Own Dyes</a><br />*Currently, our fashion industry is reliant on dye imported from the city of Viswall. This is not sustainable, especially when the Lorentish and Gawedi keep fighting over that city. We must send agents to acquire the secrets of dye - the forests of Terr are said to have some plants that could be used to create dye, once we know how.* | <li>owns core province 301</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A07:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>PREV</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>A08:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>PREV</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>North Viswall</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>South Viswall</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is North Viswall</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is South Viswall</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>301:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>change trade goods = dyes</li></ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = A07</li><li>value = -40</li></ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = A08</li><li>value = -40</li></ul><li>A07:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = PREV</li><li>value = -40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>A08:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = PREV</li><li>value = -40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [A Minor Nuisance](#A93_minor_nuisance)<br /> |
| <a name="A93_heirs_of_balgar">Heirs of Balgar</a><br />*To the east lie the Silver Dwarves and Imperial Gnomes of Esmaria, who though not Esmari themselves are a core part of Esmaria. We must retake their lands and bring them, and their expertise, back into the fold.* | <li>bennonhill area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>high esmar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If ashfields area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If wexhills area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "heirs_of_balgar" for 20 years</li> | [Loot Leslinpár](#A93_loot_leslinpar)<br /> |
