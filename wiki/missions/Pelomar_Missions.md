| <a name="pelomar_reclaim_pelodard">Reclaim Pelodard</a><br />*An embarrassment to our rule, control over our rightful realm of Pelodard has decayed over the centuries. Once a bastion of the Eordellon faith and the Oathsworn name, the traitors of Kairncal turned to worshipping the Spring a few centuries after the unfortunate defeat of the first Oathsworn. Our ancestors have failed to reintegrate them, it is up to us to restore our rightful rule over Kairncal and Pelodard!* | <li>pelodard area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If gathgob area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If drisleak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Honor the Ancestors](#pelomar_honor_the_ancestors)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_arakepruni_rivals">Arakepruni Rivals</a><br />*Arakeprun has always been our enemy, taunting us for the defeat of Pelodan the First by their deceitful hands. Although they pride themselves as being the heralds of spring, the season of renewal, they do not hesitate to stoop to the past to mock our honour. It is time that their mockery is silenced.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is rival is Arakeprun</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Arakeprun</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Arakeprun</li></ul><li>war with is Arakeprun</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "pelomar_bitter_rivalry" for 20 years</li> | [Reclaim Pelodard](#pelomar_reclaim_pelodard)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_elchosi_frontier">Elchosi Frontier</a><br />*The Dukad of Elchos lies between the most righteous Pelomar and the Arakepruni worms. Although in the past the Oathsworn aided the Elchosi in their fight for independence, let it not be misunderstood that they are not our allies. The Elchosi were an opportunity to hurt our hated rivals; they are also Vernal iconoclasts who have turned away from the teachings of the Fey. Their lands should also prove as a prime border and frontline for our continued efforts against the Selpheregi heretics.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>monkast area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province distance:</li><ul><li>2007</li><li>distance is at least 100</li></ul><li>province distance:</li><ul><li>2008</li><li>distance is at least 100</li></ul><li>province distance:</li><ul><li>2009</li><li>distance is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "pelomar_arakeprun_border" for 15 years</li> | [Arakepruni Rivals](#pelomar_arakepruni_rivals)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_end_the_selphereg_apostasy">The Selphereg Apostasy</a><br />*With Elchos and the greater Monkast area under the control of the Oathsworn, Arakeprun itself lies within our reach. The heart of the Spring heresy will be wrenched out, bringing Eordand one step closer to the unity promised by our oath.* | <li>darhan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2007:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul> | <li>2007:</li><ul><li>change culture = peitar</li><li>change province name = "Sakflor"</li><li>rename capital = "Sakflor"</li></ul><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If trasand area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If iadth area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ruigfar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Elchosi Frontier](#pelomar_elchosi_frontier)<br />[Subdue the Heretics](#pelomar_subdue_heretical_worship)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_wane_of_the_autumn_moon">Wane of the Autumn Moon</a><br />*The lair of the Autumn Court, Einnsag, lies not far from the Vernal heart of Arakeprun. Known for the strength of their legions, the Autumn Court also defends its holy city with the isolating power of the waves. If we can bypass these defences, the Autumn Court's power will have diminished like the waning of the moon.* | <li>2159:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Einnsag</li></ul> | <li>add war exhaustion = -2</li><li>add treasury = 100</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>2159:</li><ul><li>change culture = peitar</li><li>change province name = "Lebhard"</li><li>rename capital = "Lebhard"</li></ul><li>If sglolad area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If raithlos area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tamharcroc area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If fogharbac area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Selphereg Apostasy](#pelomar_end_the_selphereg_apostasy)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_extinguish_darblath_autumnals">Extinguish Darblath Autumnals</a><br />*The remnants of the Autumn Court rally in Darblath, their northern stronghold against the Snecboth. They will expect no mercy but the chance of rejoining the Eordellon flock. After our conquest of Darblath, it will make a fine bulwark against the Winter Court heretics, a Fortress of the Four Seasons.* | <li>1969:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Eighard</li></ul> | <li>1969:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "pelomar_fortress_of_four"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Wane of the Autumn Moon](#pelomar_wane_of_the_autumn_moon)<br /> |

| <a name="pelomar_honor_the_ancestors">Honor the Ancestors</a><br />*On the outskirts of Pelodard vast expanses of virgin woodland stand, but underneath the roots of the ancient trees lie the tombs and graves of the fallen Peitar throughout the centuries. Ashes turned to soil over the many years nourish the trees, and it is said that woods are safeguarded by spirits of the dead. Let us honour our ancestors by constructing a series of monuments throughout the charnel woods, so that all may know the sacrifices that have been made for us to live today.* | <li>2034:</li><ul><li>development is at least 7</li></ul><li>2029:</li><ul><li>development is at least 7</li></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy medium effect = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li> |  |
| <a name="pelomar_prove_oathsworn_name">Dynasty of the Oathsworn</a><br />*Half shrouded in myth, the Oathsworn dynasty derives its name from the oath taken by the first Pelodan. When the first Eordans left the Domandrod after the cataclysms that ravaged the land, the people were all united in the tenets taught by the Fey. As the years passed and lands resettled, some of the Eordans began to favor one season over the rest, abandoning their faith for idolatry. The faithful few, the Peitar, who kept to the traditions were united by the first Pelodan, who swore to restore the balance of the seasons throughout Eordand to the Domandrod Fey. Alas, their cause failed as Pelodan was slain by the heretics, as the enemies of the Eordellon rallied behind the restorers of Arakeprun. Ever since his defeat, the Peitar have been splintered having lost their faith in the Oathsworn, and the leaders of Pelomar have stubbornly sworn one after the oath taken so long ago.* | <li>has legitimacy equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 99</li></ul><li>prestige is at least 50</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>accepted culture is selphereg</li><li>accepted culture  is caamas</li></ul><li>government rank is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>If monkast area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If paskala area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li> | [Reclaim Pelodard](#pelomar_reclaim_pelodard)<br />[Romance of the Southrealms](#pelomar_romance_of_the_southrealms)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_subdue_heretical_worship">Subdue the Heretics</a><br />*It is our mandate to lead the Peitar and bring balance to the seasons. There is no doubt that our cause is just, for we alone are the Oathsworn, Champions of the Fey. All those who dare twist the words of the Domandrod will learn the error of their ways: the time of heresy will be over.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>accepted culture is selphereg</li><li>accepted culture  is caamas</li></ul><li>government rank is at least 3</li></ul><li>pelodard area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul><li>drisleak area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul><li>gathgob area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul><li>2035:</li><ul><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul><li>2023:</li><ul><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "peitar_inquisition" for 25 years</li> | [Dynasty of the Oathsworn](#pelomar_prove_oathsworn_name)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_winter_winds_vanquished">Winter-Winds Vanquished</a><br />*The north of Eordand is a cold, savage land beset by warfare between the fanatics of Autumn and Winter. Beyond Darblath the two factions battle each other from Jhorgashirr and Gemradcurt: both must be seized and brought back to the tenets of Eordellon.* | <li>jhorgashirr area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>gemradcurt area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>1775:</li><ul><li>religion is eordellon</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add treasury = 100</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>1775:</li><ul><li>change culture = peitar</li><li>change province name = "Darbait"</li><li>rename capital = "Darbait"</li></ul><li>If medhan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If fardach area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dartir area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Extinguish Darblath Autumnals](#pelomar_extinguish_darblath_autumnals)<br />[The Northern Passage](#pelomar_the_northern_passage)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_harmony_of_the_seasons">Harmony of the Seasons</a><br />*Now that the four seasonal courts of Eordand have been seized and their heresy ended, the Oathsworn may finally be close fulfilling their oath. Pelomar must stand firm that the true path is a united Eordand, balanced in all the seasons, all under the one who carried forth the will of the Fey.* | <li>religious unity is at least 0.9</li><li>religion is eordellon</li><li>has legitimacy equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 90</li></ul><li>prestige is at least 75</li> | <li>If eordand superregion does not have owned by is ROOT; and  is city:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "pelomar_eordand_united" for 50 years</li> | [Winter-Winds Vanquished](#pelomar_winter_winds_vanquished)<br /> |

| <a name="pelomar_romance_of_the_southrealms">Romance of the Southrealms</a><br />*Whether it be a fragrant spring day or in the frozen depths of winter, Pelodan X Oathsworn and Leslindel Swiftsword of Sidpar have shined as the radiant example of matrimony. Their love has brought Pelomar and Sidpar together, ending many years of bitter war and decline for the two states.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has consort flag [pelomar_leslindel](../flags/pelomar_leslindel.md)</li><li>is year is at least 1454</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has consort flag [pelomar_leslindel](../flags/pelomar_leslindel.md)</li></ul><li>is year is at least 1464</li><li>marriage with is Sidpar</li></ul></ul> | <li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "pelomar_admired_love"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul> | [Honor the Ancestors](#pelomar_honor_the_ancestors)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_colltin_purchase">Colltin Conference</a><br />*Pelomar itself is detached from the Domandrod, and our neighbour the dukad of Sidpar controls the province of Colltin that would connect us. Colltin was a contested land before the marriage between our two states, turning it sick with decay and rot from magical intensification of the death from battle. While the land is of little value itself, it is invaluable that we secure our own entry to the Domandrod without relying on our perhaps temporary relations with Sidpar.* | <li>2039:</li><ul><li>owned by is Sidpar</li></ul><li>2033:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Sidpar</li><li>value is at least 180</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>the event [Colltin Purchase - Choices](../events/colltin_purchase_choices.md) happens</li> | [Romance of the Southrealms](#pelomar_romance_of_the_southrealms)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_aid_to_sidparen_relatives">Aid to Sidpar</a><br />*Our partner of Sidpar has its own share of problems, beset by Summer Court heretics. As Peitar it is our duty to aid our brethren, and as Oathsworn it is our responsibility.

| <a name="pelomar_gatethrone_of_sidpar">Gatethrone of Sidpar</a><br />*For many years our alliance with Sidpar has stood as a shining bulwark of Eordellon purity in the south of Eordan. With the rise of our power in the region, the question of Sidpar's independence has arisen. In the days of Pelodan X, the royal consort Leslindel often wrote to her brother Taelarian Swiftsword that a united Pelomar and Sidpar would be far more effective than as disparate states. And as our Peitar brothers, they are under our Oath subjects of the Champion of the Fey. We will make it clear that they are our subjects now.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Sidpar</li><li>prestige is Sidpar</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Sidpar</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>H06:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li></ul></ul><li>H06:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Sidpar</li></ul><li>owns core province 2042</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is H06, and  does not have subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>vassalize = H06</li><li>add dip power = -150</li></ul><li>If serakriok area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = H06</li></ul><li>If murdkather area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = H06</li></ul> | [Aid to Sidpar](#pelomar_aid_to_sidparen_relatives)<br />[Subdue the Heretics](#pelomar_subdue_heretical_worship)<br />[Spilled Salt](#pelomar_spilled_salt)<br /> |
| <a name="pelomar_swiftsword_legacy">Swiftsword Legacy</a><br />*The Swiftswords of Sidpar claimed themselves the reclaimers of the Sarmadfar, aspiring to end the Summer Court by subjugating Dearktir and Murdkather.

| <a name="pelomar_the_northern_passage">The Northern Passage</a><br />*A narrow stretch of arid land at the eastern edge of the Domandrod connects the lands of the Sarmadfar and the Randrunnse. Held by the Strutmar Peitar, these lands will prove invaluable if we are to expand further north, and bring the Tuathak and Snecboth back into the fold.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 2045</li><li>trimgarb area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Trimgarb</li></ul><li>H20:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If galbhan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If jhorgashirr area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>trimgarb area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>2045:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Swiftsword Legacy](#pelomar_swiftsword_legacy)<br /> |

However, the many years of devastating war with the heretics have not allowed this region to prosper. With our hold secured in this region, the greater Sidpar and Gannag river can be developed to be a shining jewel, with subsistence farming replaced by crops that will bring prosperity to all.* | <li>2030:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is Sidpar</li></ul><li>development is at least 12</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2041:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is Sidpar</li></ul><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2030:</li><ul><li>change culture = peitar</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "pelomar_gannag"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change trade goods = cotton</li></ul><li>2041:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul><li>2042:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Gatethrone of Sidpar](#pelomar_gatethrone_of_sidpar)<br /> |
