| <a name="G59_hunting_pearls">Hunting Pearls</a><br />* Anisíkheion was founded by Kherkan pearl hunters as a base of operations. While we have long since moved past those early days, much of our population still partakes in the practice. Recently, our pearl hunters have found signs of significant quantities of pearls off the coast of the islands of Agonisí, Anikhein, and Proylasí. This is a great opportunity to breathe new life into these once quiet isles by investing in infrastructure for our pearl hunters on these islands.* | <li>2718:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is Anisikheion</li></ul><li>2750:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is Anisikheion</li></ul><li>2681:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is Anisikheion</li></ul> | <li>2718:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul><li>2750:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul><li>2681:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul> | [Invest In Our City](#G59_invest_in_our_city)<br /> |
| <a name="G59_expanding_fleet_facilities">Expanding Fleet Facilities</a><br />*As our control of the seas grows, so too must our fleet. Unfortunately, we do not currently have the infrastructure to support the fleet we need. Our admirals have proposed a massive building project across our territories to remedy this issue. Our engineers have also proposed the construction of a great naval arsenal upon the island of Anisíkheion. The costs may be great, but the results will be worth it.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>has building shipyard</li><li>has building  dock</li></ul><li>amount is at least 10</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is G59_expanding_fleet_facilities_trigger_tt</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is naval_reformer</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li></ul></ul> | <li>2717:</li><ul><li>If has building is dock:</li><ul><li>remove building = dock</li><li>add building = drydock</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add building = drydock</li></ul><li>If has building is shipyard:</li><ul><li>remove building = shipyard</li><li>add building = grand_shipyard</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add building = grand_shipyard</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = G59_the_kosphikem_arsenal</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has employed advisor has type is naval reformer:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -300</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -500</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = G59_expanding_fleet_facilities_effect_tt</li><li>upgrade admiralty influence modifier effect = yes</li> | [Hunting Pearls](#G59_hunting_pearls)<br /> |
| <a name="G59_inviting_kheionai_diplomats">Invite Diplomats</a><br />*As our city grows even more than anyone could imagine, we are starting to gain attention from the Alecandi kheions who had for so long overlooked us. Our city is by size alone just as great as theirs, but if we invite their diplomats to our city, it could be shown in beauty as well. Let us invite them to our great city, and let them spread stories of our city’s grandeur upon their return!* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is kheionai_ruinborn_elf</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is G59_inviting_kheionai_diplomats_trigger_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has personal deity kheio_dip_factions</li><li>has personal deity  kheio_dip_2</li></ul></ul><li>crown land share is at least 33</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is G59_vassal_trigger_tt</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Visit](../events/the_visit.md) happens</li> | [Expanding Fleet Facilities](#G59_expanding_fleet_facilities)<br />[The Greatest Kheion](#G59_the_greatest_kheion)<br /> |

| <a name="G59_invest_in_our_city">Invest In Our City</a><br />*When we were chained to our parent city, Kherka, we never had much room to grow. Our economy was entirely dependent on feeding Kherka, and the only people who moved here were convicts and exiles sent away from Kherka. With us now being independent and free, it is about time we invested our new found surplus wealth into growing our city into one able to rival those of Alecand.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>2717:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is Anisikheion</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>2717:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = G59_a_growing_kheion</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> | [Kherkan Overreach](#G59_kherkan_overreach)<br /> |

Our sailors call for improved dockyard infrastructure, more housing needs to be built, and so much more. We shall invest more into our city than ever before, for we should not stop at being merely "equal" to the great kheions!* | <li>2717:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is Anisikheion</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 30</li><li>add treasury = 200</li><li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = all</li><li>share = -10</li></ul> | [Invest In Our City](#G59_invest_in_our_city)<br />[Consolidate The South Sea](#G59_consolidate_the_southern_cleaved_sea)<br /> |
| <a name="G59_the_greatest_kheion">The Greatest Kheion</a><br />*Even the poorest of Anisíkheion’s residents are as wealthy as the average resident of the other kheions, for we are not just superior in terms of size, but in wealth as well. Even with all our progress, there is still so much potential. We will create the greatest, most beautiful city, the greatest of the Kheionai!* | <li>2717:</li><ul><li>development is at least 35</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is Anisikheion</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Question of Greatness](../events/the_question_of_greatness.md) happens</li> | [Hunting Pearls](#G59_hunting_pearls)<br />[A Great Kheion](#G59_a_great_kheion)<br /> |

| <a name="G59_kheions_of_the_sea">Kheions Of The Sea</a><br />*Our recent investments into our island territories have paid off greatly, with these islands hosting new, growing cities with just as much potential as Anisíkheion had. Interestingly enough, these new cities are also host to increasing immigration from Alecand, as a way to escape the increasingly powerful deathwinds. It is time we invest even more into these new cities, for success breeds more success.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 2717</li></ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is anisikheion_area</li><li>area  is soreion_area</li><li>area   is vothelisi_area</li><li>area    is arpenisi_area</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier G59_alecandi_immigration for 25 years</li> | [Invite Diplomats](#G59_inviting_kheionai_diplomats)<br />[Develop The Home Isles](#G59_develop_the_southern_islands)<br /> |

Once we have become their overlords, they will no longer be able to dismiss us, and no one can dare ignore our place in the sun, as the greatest of the Kheionai.* | <li>2745:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Anisikheion</li></ul></ul><li>2773:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Anisikheion</li></ul></ul><li>2738:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Anisikheion</li></ul></ul><li>2736:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Anisikheion</li></ul></ul><li>2732:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Anisikheion</li></ul></ul><li>2731:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Anisikheion</li></ul></ul><li>2728:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Anisikheion</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Alecandi Humilliation](../events/alecandi_humilliation.md) happens</li> | [Show Them Reality](#G59_show_them_reality)<br /> |

| <a name="G59_kherkan_overreach">Kherkan Overreach</a><br />*Ever since our founding generations ago, we have sat comfortably under the protection of our Kherkan overlords. They granted us much autonomy in return for handling our foreign affairs. Recently, however, the Kherkan state has been trying to gain increasing control over our state, in a potential attempt to annex us. We will not let this happen. It’s about time we break free from our parent city, and guarantee our future.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is vassal</li><li>is at war</li></ul> | <li>the event [Freedom?](../events/freedom.md) happens</li> |  |

The southern Cleaved Sea is our rightful sea, yet many of its islands are controlled by foreign, potentially hostile powers. Many influential members of our republic, including the admiralty and merchants, want to see the southern Cleaved Sea under our control.

It is the last remnant of a land bridge that once connected Alecand to the mainland. While this fact is interesting enough on its own, the islands also serve as a barrier, a wall dividing The Cleaved Sea in two. Whoever controls the Vothelisí islands controls the trade through The Cleaved Sea. This fact alone has led to our merchants calling for us to seize the islands. Our admiralty too are supportive of this, fearful of the security implications of these islands falling into the hands of an enemy.\n\nWe shall send scouts to the area to poke at its weaknesses, for potential holes in its defenses.

It was always a stable source of revenue, and could be relied on…And then the corsairs appeared. In hindsight, the southern passage was always vulnerable to piracy, but only now had that threat become realized.\n\nOur scouts report that these pirates operate out of the newly independent kheion of Amgremós, and that they have the unofficial support of the state of Amgremós. Officially, Amgremós denies their collaboration with the corsairs, although we know the truth.
