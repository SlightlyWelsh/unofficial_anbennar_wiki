| <a name="Y63_harbor_dinh_loyalists">Harbor Dinh Loyalists</a><br />*Dihn has been executed, and the prince's revolt has been crushed. Though, within the ghost emperor's domain, Dihn's admirers still number many, with lots of nobles unhappy about the ghost emperor's reign. If we are to eventually control the Baihon Xihn and affirm our position as king of the Kai once again, we must first begin by allowing many of the disgraced nobles who remained loyal to Dinh to settle in the outskirts of Verkal Ozovar, promising that they can eventually regain control of their realm if they remain loyal to the true king, the one under the mountain.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y67</li></ul><li>Y67:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has saved event target baihon_winner_event_target</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>event_target:baihon_winner_event_target</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>event target:baihon winner event target:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>5424:</li><ul><li>add human minority size effect = yes</li><li>add human minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>the event [Whispers Among the Elephant Grove](../events/whispers_among_the_elephant_grove.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>complete mission = Y63_welcome_hinphati_veterans</li></ul> | [The Civil Intercession](#Y63_civil_intercession)<br /> |
| <a name="Y63_prepare_hykhuwok">Prepare the Hykhuwok</a><br />*If we wish to not follow the same fate as Dihn's rebellion, we must strengthen our Hinphati allies further. By expanding the Hykuwok (Jadechosen in their native language) through a process of enlargening our armor and weapons production in the Hinphat lands, we can ensure that the Hykuwok are going to be prepared against invaders that dare threaten the mountain.* | <li>4945:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>4775:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>4776:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>If every subject country has primary culture is hinphat:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Y63_preparing_the_hykhuwok for 10 years</li></ul> | [Harbor Dinh Loyalists](#Y63_harbor_dinh_loyalists)<br /> |

A second war for the mantle of Baihon Xihn shall begin, and this time, we shall not fail.

| <a name="Y63_keeping_our_promises">Keeping our Promises</a><br />*The Ghost Emperor's reign has ended, and we now see the duandi control the mantle of Baihon Xinh. But, unlike the ghost emperor, the dwarves are an honorable people. We shall in all of our benevolence allow the Dihn loyalists who settled in our hold to once again rule over the former lands of Hon Sai. Though they shall never be able to claim the mantle of Baihon Xihn themselves, they should be honored to have been granted land under the rule of the mountain king, and kneel to the true king of the Kai.* | <li>event target:baihon winner event target:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>phonan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>ananhu area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>nui phom area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [Keeping our Promises](../events/keeping_our_promises.md) happens</li><li>5424:</li><ul><li>remove human minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>complete mission = Y63_shadow_of_the_mountain</li></ul> | [End the Ghost Emperor](#Y63_end_ghost_emperor)<br /> |

| <a name="Y63_welcome_hinphati_veterans">Welcome Veterans</a><br />*With Dihn's victory, many veterans of the civil war, especially among the Hinphat, are astonished by our prowess in battle, our mighty cannons and our viridescent armor. Because of this, many soldiers have flocked to Verkal Ozovar. Though humans have not traditionally served in the main armies of Verkal Ozovar, it would be foolish not to accept these battle-hardened warriors coming into our hold to serve in our armies.

| <a name="Y63_honor_beyond_the_mountain">Honor Beyond the Mountain</a><br />*Ever since the dissolution of our former empire across Thidinkai, we have distrusted the little states that have popped up across South Haless. But, Caoban Dihn has shown us that honor can be found beyond the Hinphats. Though we do wish to reclaim our empire, it is time for us to reconcile with the Kai and send an official treaty of friendship to Dihn.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has saved event target baihon_winner_event_target</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>event_target:baihon_winner_event_target</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>alliance with is event_target:baihon_winner_event_target</li></ul> | <li>the event [Treaty of the Kai](../events/treaty_of_the_kai.md) happens</li> | [Welcome Veterans](#Y63_welcome_hinphati_veterans)<br /> |

A letter shall be sent to Caoban Dihn, demanding his allegiance to the mountain king. If he refuses, he shall face the force of the duandi, if he accepts, he shall have the protection and be given the gifts of the benevolent rule of the duandi.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has saved event target baihon_winner_event_target</li></ul><li>army size is event_target:baihon_winner_event_target</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size is Y67</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y63_more_than_friends_tt</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>mission completed is Y63_honor_beyond_the_mountain</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier Y63_treaty_happened</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>never</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is Y97:</li><ul><li>event target:baihon winner event target:</li><ul><li>the event [The Duandi Open Renegotiation](../events/the_duandi_open_renegotiation.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Y67:</li><ul><li>the event [The Duandi Open Renegotiation](../events/the_duandi_open_renegotiation.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [Honor Beyond the Mountain](#Y63_honor_beyond_the_mountain)<br /> |

We can respect this undying tenacity that the foundations of Verkal Ozovar were built upon, for we are the same.

| <a name="Y63_wonderful_wizards_of_oz">Wonderful Wizards of Oz</a><br />*Mage guilds are commonplace throughout Haless as the spirits of the land enable or inspire magic of all kinds. Many human mages scoffed at the thought that enchanted stones could match their power, but Verkal Ozovar has rebuked their ignorance with concrete results. Our capabilites are a match for any of our rivals, and to surpass them we must reorganize the magical institutions in our hold to focus on the development and application of runesmithing.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>desc is Y63_wonderful_wizards_of_oz_tt</li><li>amount is at least 4</li><li>asia:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_mages_patronage_of_the_magical_arts</li> | <li>the event [The Place of Runesmithing](../events/the_place_of_runesmithing.md) happens</li> | [High King of the Kai](#Y63_king_of_kai)<br /> |
| <a name="Y63_wisdom_of_ancients">Wisdom of the Ancients</a><br />*The Oz-Amekh, or Eastern King in the Dwarven language, was the ancient founder of Verkal Ozovar who ruled thousands of years ago under a forgotten name. But after passing, his legacy endures in a way unique to Haless: he persists in our hold as a spirit, only showing himself to the enlightened or to mystics that seek his presence through asceticism. These manifestations are rare, but the recent Ozovari magical shift seems to have changed his behavior. The Oz-Amekh has called out to [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and requested an audience. To do so, [Root.Monarch.GetName] must commune with the spirit in order to receive the wisdom of our revered ancestor.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is at war</li></ul><li>monthly adm is at least 6</li><li>monthly dip is at least 6</li><li>monthly mil is at least 6</li><li>does not have regency</li> | <li>country gets the modifier Y63_communing_with_oz_amekh for 1 years</li><li>the event [A Brief Conversation](../events/a_brief_conversation.md) happens</li> | [Wonderful Wizards of Oz](#Y63_wonderful_wizards_of_oz)<br />[Secrets from Days Gone](#Y63_secrets_from_days_gone)<br /> |

In our unfallen hold, the runic legacy has endured and been inflamed anew while offering refuge to our displaced kin and establishing a dominion of dwarves over men. But we have heard tales of dwarven adventurers that have braved the emptied halls of old and restored lost legacies. Let us see what these reclaimers have wrought, and show them the transcendent runic renaissance that we alone have built.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture is dwarven is yes</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is east_serpentspine_superregion</li></ul></ul></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>culture is dwarven is yes</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture is dwarven is yes</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y63_runic_renaissance_tt</li><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = Y63_unlocked_jorkin_rune_tt</li><li>set country flag [Y63_unlocked_jorkin_rune](../flags/y63_unlocked_jorkin_rune.md)</li> | [Engrave the Core Nephrite](#Y63_engrave_core_nephrite)<br /> |

| <a name="Y63_civil_intercession">The Civil Intercession</a><br />*Verkal Ozovar has long stood as one of the most prosperous and stable places in all of Haless. Even before the Day of Ashen Skies, Verkal Ozovar stood as the king over Thidinkai. But, after thousands of years, our influence has diminished quite heavily.

| <a name="Y63_seeds_of_distrust">Seeds of Distrust</a><br />*With the war over Baihon Xihn, the opportunistic Bokai, in a bid to free themselves from the Chien Binhrung rose against their masters under the leadership of lord Pulatan. Where a problem lies is that the Bokai have traditionally been hostile to the dwarves, and though they have temporarily reached a detente with Verkal Ozovar due to the war for Baihon Xihn, it is no question that relations will suffer in the future. This means that sooner or later, loyalties will be broken and a new war could engulf Thidinkai again. Verkal Ozovar must use all of its means, even if they aren't the most honorable, to prevent this.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Y67:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Y71</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Y67:</li><ul><li>trust:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Y71</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has Y67 has alliance with is Y71:</li><ul><li>Y67:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = Y71</li><li>value = -25</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = Y71</li><li>modifier = Y63_seeds_of_distrust</li></ul><li>reverse add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = Y71</li><li>modifier = Y63_seeds_of_distrust</li></ul></ul><li>Y71:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Y63_diplomatic_sabotage for 5 years</li></ul></ul> | [Harbor Dinh Loyalists](#Y63_harbor_dinh_loyalists)<br />[Welcome Veterans](#Y63_welcome_hinphati_veterans)<br /> |
| <a name="Y63_quash_the_revolt">Quash the Revolt</a><br />*Back when Verkal Ozovar was an empire encompassing all of the Kai, the Bokai were the first to revolt and declare independence against the rule of the dwarves. The Bokai have now risen again against their masters, and have seen themselves under the rule of a petty warlord just as they did thousands of years ago. It is now time to end this ancient revolt and take the city of Nirakvonkai, built in defiance against the dwarves.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has global flag [khom_civilwar_honsai_won_war](../flags/khom_civilwar_honsai_won_war.md)</li></ul><li>trade embargoing is Y71</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>truce with is Y71</li></ul><li>is not at war</li> | <li>If has exists is Y71:</li><ul><li>declare war with cb:</li><ul><li>who = Y71</li><li>casus belli = cb_vassalize_mission</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = Y63_kudet_kai_tt</li><li>If has global flag is [khom_civilwar_honsai_won_war](../flags/khom_civilwar_honsai_won_war.md):</li><ul><li>4751:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4751:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>reverse add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = ROOT</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Seeds of Distrust](#Y63_seeds_of_distrust)<br /> |

| <a name="Y63_secrets_from_days_gone">Secrets from Days Gone</a><br />*The runesmiths have made an astonishing discovery. Using focusing and amplification techniques extracted from the ruined temple complex of Duandipom, minor runic beacons with small engraved nephrite gems can be specifically arranged to achieve what was before unimaginable: projecting a rune across our entire country for short periods of time. Upon activation, the lines of the rune coalesce in the sky and rain down a thin sparkling mist before dissipating. The nephrite gems will eventually burn out in each minor beacon, and the beacons themselves will have to be replaced and relocated to change the effect, but these hindrances only spur the ambitions of our rune-mages. In time, we will have total mastery over this new power.* | <li>4755:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier Y63_investigatory_expedition</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>custom tooltip = Y63_unlocked_minor_runes_tt</li><li>set country flag [Y63_unlocked_minor_runes](../flags/y63_unlocked_minor_runes.md)</li> | [Investigate the Old Fort](#Y63_investigate_old_fort)<br />[Wonderful Wizards of Oz](#Y63_wonderful_wizards_of_oz)<br /> |

Now, Verkal Ozovar has passed its need to rely on the lords of the Hinphats.
