| <a name="A33_the_hunt_for_eggs">The Hunt for Eggs</a><br />*More and more sightings of wyverns have occurred since we retook Khenak, as if it was divine providence.

| <a name="A33_reviving_the_wyverns">Taming the Wyverns</a><br />*While we have constructed a suitable sanctuary, it is said that the first wyvern rider Armoc Vernid was aided by loyal mages to increase his strength, affinity, and more importantly: the chance that the wyvern will bond with its would-be rider. We must do the same, in addition to properly warding the structure or else our enemies may steal our secrets.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has province modifier "verne_sanctuary"</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>ruler has mage personality is yes</li><li>Have an advisor of type court_mage</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "verne_wyvern_riders" until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = verne_wyvern_aces_tt</li><li>the event [Ardan Orcsbane](../events/ardan_orcsbane.md) happens</li> | [Build the Sanctuary](#A33_build_the_sanctuary)<br /> |

| <a name="A33_the_lai_peninsula">The Lai Peninsula</a><br />*We have found a great, dry peninsula, reminiscent in many ways of the lands to our south. It would be a suitable place for a colony, as our experiences in Akan could be useful there.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is verne_lai_colony</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is Verne</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_lai_peninsula</li></ul><li>num of cities is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Laurens of Thanallen](../events/laurens_of_thanallen.md) happens</li> | [New Opportunities](#A33_new_opportunities)<br /> |
| <a name="A33_leechdens">Leechdens</a><br />*There is a great swamp in the west, known to its inhabitants as the 'Leechdens'. While swamps are not the most appealing lands to settle, let alone tropical swamps, this one is very strategically placed to influence local trade and so we should take some of it for ourselves. As long as we remember to bring boots.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is verne_leechdens_colony</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is Verne</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_leechden</li></ul><li>num of cities is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Daravan of Damespearl](../events/daravan_of_damespearl.md) happens</li> | [The Lai Peninsula](#A33_the_lai_peninsula)<br /> |
| <a name="A33_ruins_of_the_south">Ruins of the South</a><br />*The southern part of the Ruin is ideal for growing many of the new crops we have found in the west, and has few significant local tribes.
