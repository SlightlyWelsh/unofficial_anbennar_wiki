| <a name="elizna_new_generation">A New Generation</a><br />*Our armies, like the legions of the Phoenix Empire, are made up of Sun Elves and only Sun Elves. During the reign of the past two monarchs, we have won many wars and claimed much land, but this has come at the cost of soldiers' lives, lives which take time to replace. Unfortunately, while our long lifespans give us the rare opportunity to truly master the arts we choose to pursue, it also means that we are slow to repopulate our numbers. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s generation has come to the age where they can begin to refill our numbers. Though they will need training to be in the army and this will take time, our legions sorely need the new novitiates.* | <li>mil tech is at least 5</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.5</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_novitiate_legionnaires for 50 years</li> |  |
| <a name="elizna_human_auxiliaries">Human Auxiliaries</a><br />*As times change so too do the needs of warfare. As military tactics improve and numbers grow, we find ourselves with a shortage of viable Sun Elves for our armies. This means we lag behind and risk even more Sun Elf losses in the field. Some of our generals have taken to hiring human mercenary companies, to offset the casualty rate among our own soldiers. This has proven highly effective, and they have approached us with a proposal to officially sponsor several major human mercenary companies in the country. This way there will be no shortage of soldiers and our precious Sun Elves will be less likely to die in the field.* | <li>num of mercenaries is at least 10</li> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_human_auxiliaries_1 until otherwise removed</li> | [A New Generation](#elizna_new_generation)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_integrate_humans">Integrate Humans</a><br />*Having the human mercenaries serve as auxiliaries in our armies has proven to be a brilliant decision! Our elven soldiers suffer from next to no casualties and are becoming a highly disciplined force. While having mercenaries in our armies is helpful to reduce the strain on our realm's economy, it would be prudent to begin integrating our own human population into the military as well. With the right investment and infrastructure, we could have a well-trained human army fronted by our elite Sun Elven legions thus solving our problem of low recruitment numbers.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>accepted culture is kheteratan</li><li>accepted culture  is shasoura</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is kheteratan</li><li>culture  is shasoura</li></ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>If does not have country modifier is human military:</li><ul><li>clear racial military = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier restructuring_military for 5 years</li><li>country gets the modifier human_military until otherwise removed</li><li>change unit type = tech_salahadesi</li></ul><li>remove country modifier = U05_human_auxiliaries_1</li><li>country gets the modifier U05_human_auxiliaries_2 until otherwise removed</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_elizna_elven_legionnaires</li></ul> | [Human Auxiliaries](#elizna_human_auxiliaries)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_role_of_elves">Role of the Elves</a><br />*Our newly organized human-based military is proving very effective in battle and very easy to reinforce with new soldiers, while mercenaries are flocking to our lands, chasing the generous supplements we offer for their services. Our elven legions have been put to good use as an elite fighting force, able to strike hard wherever they are needed. Our navy, on the other hand, has suffered from the loss of elven sailors. While the humans are fine sailors and are plentiful, our elves are far superior. Our generals believe that our elven population on Elizna and the Drolas Peninsula should be made to serve in our navies and our elite legions, utilizing their strengths as efficiently as possible.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>494:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul><li>496:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul><li>573:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul><li>578:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 5</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier U05_elven_navy until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier U05_elite_elves until otherwise removed</li> | [Integrate Humans](#elizna_integrate_humans)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_elven_officers_human_soldiers">Elven Officers, Human Army</a><br />*With the advent of more professional officer corps being seen in the militaries of the world, our generals have proposed that we do the same. With the construction of a few academies to teach them at, our new Sun Elven officers can be instructed in all the things that our generals, with their centuries of experience, think they might need to know. In this way, we can pass on vastly more knowledge than the average officer would receive, and they in turn will pass on that and more that they learn in their lifetime. Truly, our officers will be the finest in the world, and their soldiers will be the best commanded.* | <li>mil tech is at least 9</li><li>army size is at least 40</li><li>army tradition is at least 65</li> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_elven_officers for 50 years</li> | [Role of the Elves](#elizna_role_of_elves)<br /> |

| <a name="elizna_secure_brasan">Secure Brasan</a><br />*Our holdings in Brasan are small, but they cut straight through the center. This gives us a strong point from which to invade the rest of Brasan and take the ancient city for ourselves. If we can secure the mouth of the Suran, we can use it to supply our soldiers all the way up the river into Bulwar. Plus, once the city is under our control, there will be no one left to rival our burgeoning naval hegemony in the southern Divenhal! Once our position in Brasan is secure, we can begin to heavily fortify the Šad Sur to cover our advance from the gnolls who have infested it.* | <li>upper brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>lower brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>682:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_15th</li><li>speed = 1.0</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul></ul><li>irrliam area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>anzabad area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>medurubar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="elizna_eradicate_taelerios">End Taelarios' Realm</a><br />*After the fall of the Second Phoenix Empire, Taelarios claimed the lands along the Lower Suran River and has since consolidated power around himself in the form of the New Sun Cult with him at its head. But we have taken Brasan from him and now we must end his influence once and for all.* | <li>irrliam area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>anzabad area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>medurubar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Irrliam</li></ul> | <li>jixobix area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>garpix tluukt area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>grixekyr area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>zansap area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>691:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure Brasan](#elizna_secure_brasan)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_liberate_sad_sur">Liberate the Šad Sur</a><br />*Gnolls have been infesting the Šad Sur for decades now and no one has been able to push them back. They raid the lands of Bulwar, taking loot and slaves wherever they go, laying waste to the peoples' livelihoods. We must wrest control of the mountains from them and eliminate every last one of the foul demons! Bulwar shall not submit to the Darkness!* | <li>jixobix area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>garpix tluukt area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>grixekyr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>zansap area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>691:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_protector_against_darkness for 20 years</li><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [End Taelarios' Realm](#elizna_eradicate_taelerios)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_beat_birsartanses">Beat Birzartanšes</a><br />*Birzartanšes is the only significant naval power left on the eastern Divenhal. We should move to seize their mountain home and force them to submit to our superiority. We will get control over and safe passage into the Bay of Mirrors and a secure point from which to hold against the threats to the north and east and we will have removed yet one more competitor for naval supremacy in the Divenhal.* | <li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Liberate the Šad Sur](#elizna_liberate_sad_sur)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_end_the_rivalry">End the Rivalry</a><br />*Re'uyel has long stood as our rival, not only in naval presence in the Divenhal or in loyalties, during the time of the Phoenix Empire, but as far back as our dynastic founders Uyel and Vulzin, whose hatred of each other was so great that the latter refused to die of old age until the former had passed. We are now in a position to end that rivalry, to clearly prove that we are superior and always will be. We will sack the city and relocate its wealth to Koroshesh, where it can be better put to use.* | <li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>1312:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 51</li></ul></ul><li>owns core province 463</li> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_hegemon_of_southern_divenhal for 50 years</li><li>521:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -3</li><li>add base production = -3</li><li>add base manpower = -3</li><li>add devastation = 30</li><li>change trade goods = fish</li></ul><li>463:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul> | [Beat Birzartanšes](#elizna_beat_birsartanses)<br /> |

| <a name="elizna_zornartakel">Build the Zornartakel</a><br />*Baqtkhet's Retreat, the city on the other side of the Khetraz Strait, would make a perfect place for a large naval installation. An extensive military harbour complete with wharfs for building ships and academies to train sailors can be constructed alongside the current harbour. With its protected location on the southern side of Elizna, and close proximity to the strait, our fleet will have a secure place to dock and launch from and no one will be able to cross without us knowing.* | <li>494:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>base manpower is at least 8</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>494:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = U05_zornartakel</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="elizna_reformed_navy">Reformed Navy</a><br />*With the Zornartakel complete we can now construct ships much more quickly. Let us take this opportunity to build up our fleet and begin training marines to man them. We shall have the finest navy on the Divenhal some day, but we need to start with good foundations, or our efforts could be for naught.* | <li>num of light ship is at least 20</li><li>num of heavy ship is at least 10</li><li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Golden Century"</li><li>has dlc  "Rule Britannia"</li></ul></ul><li>num of marines is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>add manpower = -5</li><li>add sailors = 5000</li><li>If has dlc is "Golden Century", and has dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier U05_marines until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [Build the Zornartakel](#elizna_zornartakel)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_fleet_unopposed">Our Fleet Unopposed</a><br />*Our fleet must stand uncontested in the Divenhal, which means it must be the largest, grandest, fleet, finer even than the Imperial Navy which we held after the empire fell. We shall control the Divenhal, and no one will be able to go against us on the seas.* | <li>all known country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>navy size is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>num of light ship is at least 50</li><li>num of heavy ship is at least 20</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Country is Elizna</li></ul><li>U05 ideas is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_divenhal_tassalsocrachdwady until otherwise removed</li> | [Reformed Navy](#elizna_reformed_navy)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_develop_middle_class">Develop Middle Class</a><br />*Now that we rule the Kheteratans, we must hold true to our promises of a better life under our rule, or we will find ourselves in the same position as the Crodamos were. Plus, with the proper investments, we can really propel our economy forward by exploiting the production along the Mother's Sorrow. With the middle class of Kheterata behind us, we can move on to the nobility and solidify our hold over these lands for good.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 8</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is coast_of_tears_area</li><li>area  is mothers_delta_area</li><li>province id is at least 471</li><li>province id  is at least 472</li><li>province id   is at least 473</li><li>province id    is at least 474</li><li>province id     is at least 6088</li></ul><li>num of times improved by owner is at least 2</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_burghers_free_enterprise</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is DIP</li><li>culture is kheteratan</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_loyal_middle_class for 20 years</li><li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>share = -10</li></ul><li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_burghers</li><li>share = 10</li></ul> | [Depose the Crodamos](#elizna_depose_crodamos)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_supplant_nobility">Supplant the Nobility</a><br />*To truly control the Mother's Sorrow, we must replace the noble caste of the Kheteratans with elves. In doing so, we will place all humans in Kheterata below Sun Elves in every way, socially, spiritually, and functionally. No one will be left to contest our rule, since the people's lives have been improved greatly and those who rule them at every level are Sun Elves.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 14</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is coast_of_tears_area</li><li>area  is mothers_delta_area</li><li>province id is at least 471</li><li>province id  is at least 472</li><li>province id   is at least 473</li><li>province id    is at least 474</li><li>province id     is at least 6088</li></ul><li>infantry in province is at least 3</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = 500</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add government reform = elizna_elven_nobility_reform</li><li>custom tooltip = elizna_supplant_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>mothers delta area:</li><ul><li>add unrest = 10</li><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = elven_minority_integrated_small</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>coast of tears area:</li><ul><li>add unrest = 10</li><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>lower sorrow area:</li><ul><li>add unrest = 10</li><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>474:</li><ul><li>add unrest = 10</li><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>473:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = elven_minority_integrated_small</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Develop Middle Class](#elizna_develop_middle_class)<br /> |

| <a name="elizna_ready_legionnaires">Ready the Legionnaires</a><br />*Our armies have dwindled over the past several decades and our legionaries need to recover before we push any further towards the Mother's Sorrow. We need to ensure that we outnumber the Khetists and that we have enough reserves to supplement our armies should things turn sour on the field. Once we are prepared, we shall move on the delta.* | <li>army size is Kheterata</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.5</li><li>num of generals is at least 1</li> | <li>coast of tears area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>mothers delta area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>lower sorrow area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>470:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If :</li><ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="elizna_secure_delta">Secure the Delta</a><br />*Our armies are ready, and our battle plans are drawn. From Koroshesh we take the coastline with the help of our navy, then push south, upriver, to Nirat. Once we control the lower Mother's Sorrow and the priesthood of the Khetists, we will hold sway over the breadbasket of northern Sarhal and most of the middle class of Kheterata. They will flock to our sides as Elizna has been their advocate for many human generations.* | <li>lower sorrow area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>mothers delta area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>coast of tears area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province 470</li> | <li>kheterat proper area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>upper sorrow area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>ohitsopot area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>garpix brrtekuh area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>western krahway area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier U05_war_enthusiasm for 10 years</li> | [Ready the Legionnaires](#elizna_ready_legionnaires)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_depose_crodamos">Depose the Crodamos</a><br />*The Crodamos dynasty is poised to fall. With the Nirat rebellion and now our control of most of their territory, the people are calling for them to be deposed. And we shall happily provide. Our armies shall strike at Kheterat and then sweep up the Sorrow to the Rapids. The Crodamos will fall, and the Khetarch will have to appoint a new ruler to take their place.* | <li>kheterat proper area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>upper sorrow area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province 475</li> | <li>the event [The Khetarch Appoints a New Monarch](../events/the_khetarch_appoints_a_new_monarch.md) happens</li> | [Secure the Delta](#elizna_secure_delta)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_protect_mothers_sorrow">Mother's Sorrow Trade</a><br />*Now that the main length of the Mother's Sorrow is ours, we must solidify our hold over the delta and its trade port. The goods that flow down the river to Koroshesh are plentiful and highly sought after all over Cannor, Bulwar, and beyond. If we fortify the harbour it will attract more merchants to our shores with the promise of a safe haven from gnollish and human pirates. And if we can make it a world-renowned center, perhaps some of the other smaller markets will grow along with it.* | <li>1305:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 51</li></ul></ul><li>463:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>463:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li></ul><li>464:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul> | [Depose the Crodamos](#elizna_depose_crodamos)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_stewards_of_kheterata_pe">Stewards of Kheterata</a><br />*We have proven ourselves to be the finest stewards of the Mother's Sorrow that the Kheteratans have seen in a long, long time. The people sing our praises in every town and city, and the markets flow with goods, food, and money. The people have finally seen the Light of Surael, and they view the Sun Elves as their generous superiors in every way. We have done what Jaher could not, Kheterata is ours and it will remain ours.* | <li>mission completed is elizna_supplant_nobility</li><li>mission completed  is elizna_elven_officers_human_soldiers</li><li>mission completed   is elizna_chosen_of_surael</li><li>north salahad region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is sun_elf</li><li>culture  is kheteratan</li><li>culture   is shasoura</li></ul></ul><li>province id is at least 458</li><li>province id  is at least 453</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>legitimacy is at least 95</li><li>devotion is at least 100</li><li>republican tradition is at least 100</li></ul><li>prestige is at least 80</li> | <li>add adm power = 200</li><li>add mil power = 200</li><li>add dip power = 200</li> | [Develop Middle Class](#elizna_develop_middle_class)<br />[Mother's Sorrow Trade](#elizna_protect_mothers_sorrow)<br />[A New High Priest](#elizna_new_priest)<br /> |

| <a name="elizna_eliznan_sunrise">Eliznan Sunrise</a><br />*With our economy growing steadily, we ought to encourage its growth further in the capital. If we invest resources in the artisans and workers of our island home, we can attract far more skill, which will lead to more and better goods, which will lead to more merchants frequenting our ports. And the more merchants that come, the more competition there will be, which will lead to this whole process restarting itself over and over. Hopefully this will keep our production in a constant state of forward motion. The sun is rising over Elizna, and we must take the opportunity to keep it shining.* | <li>496:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>496:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = U05_eliznan_sunrise_mod</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="elizna_eliminate_priests">Eliminate the High Priest</a><br />*The High Priest of the Khet has stood against both our influence in Kheterata and the current ruling Crodamos dynasty. We will never be able to truly subdue and integrate the Kheteratans until we eliminate the high priest and replace his words of Kheteratan supremacy in the peoples' ears with those of Sun Elven legitimacy. Tell the people of our noble goals and they will see that living under us is far better than under any other.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Nirat</li></ul><li>owns core province 473</li><li>owns core province  472</li><li>owns core province   491</li> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_embracing_khetism for 20 years</li> | [Ready the Legionnaires](#elizna_ready_legionnaires)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_secure_western_desert">Secure Western Desert</a><br />*Now that we hold the Mother's Sorrow and the North Salahad Coast, we must look to expelling the foul gnolls from western borders. So long as they remain in the western Salahad, they will be a constant threat to our rule and the security of our realm.* | <li>ohitsopot area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>western krahway area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>is not city</li></ul></ul><li>garpix brrtekuh area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U05_expelled_gnolls for 10 years</li> | [Secure the Delta](#elizna_secure_delta)<br /> |
| <a name="elizna_new_priest">A New High Priest</a><br />*With no High Priest, the Khetarch can only wait so long before appointing a new one. We must make sure that the most eligible priests are Sun Elves to solidify our claim as rightful protectors of Kheterata. If we invest in building elven run temples across the north Salahad region and prove that we have unified our two peoples, the Khetarch will have no real choice but to appoint a Sun Elf as High Priest.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>region is north_salahad_region</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>religious unity is at least 0.50</li> | <li>the event [The Khetarch Appoints a New High Priest](../events/the_khetarch_appoints_a_new_high_priest.md) happens</li> | [Depose the Crodamos](#elizna_depose_crodamos)<br /> |

Surael will guide them along a better path than the Khet have and if we can make the people understand that, it should be easy to turn our network of religious infrastructure towards converting the Khetists rather than appeasing them. Converting the Kheteratans will be one of the greatest feats of our faith in centuries!
