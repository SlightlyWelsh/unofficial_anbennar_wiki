| <a name="Z43_empowerment">Empowerment</a><br />*Power comes at the cost of sacrifice, as proven by the ages that have come and passed. Yet we cannot spare any more blood from our kind for things as petty as power and ambition, never again. But there are many beasts that roam the lands: unfortunates that should be seen as nothing more than disgusting perversions of the beauty this land held, but even these creatures still hold some value, and it is under our great fortress where we can grant them an ascended purpose.* | <li>precursor relics is at least 6</li><li>damestear is at least 1</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>custom tooltip = z43_empowerment_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [aelnar_empowerment](../flags/aelnar_empowerment.md)</li></ul><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li> |  |
| <a name="Z43_thirsting_queen">Thirsting Queen</a><br />*It is the nature of men, our lessers, to seek things as trivial as titles and power that last them but a fraction of a fraction of the lifetime of an elf. We are not our lessers, we would never stoop so low as to seek things as trivial as fanciful titles and piles of glimmering gold and jewels. No, the ambition of an elf is incomprehensible to a simple man, and the ambition of the greatest of us even more so. Our queen is beyond even the greatest in our history, seeking something that will last her a thousand eternities.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is nbConnadh_100000_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>nbConnadh is at least 100000</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is elissa_is_alive</li><li>has ruler flag [elissa_is_alive](../flags/elissa_is_alive.md)</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is legendary_mage_tooltip</li><li>has ruler flag [abjuration_3](../flags/abjuration_3.md)</li><li>has ruler flag  conjuration_3</li><li>has ruler flag   divination_3</li><li>has ruler flag    enchantment_3</li><li>has ruler flag     evocation_3</li><li>has ruler flag      illusion_3</li><li>has ruler flag       necromancy_3</li><li>has ruler flag        transmutation_3</li></ul> | <li>the event [Thirsting For Power](../events/thirsting_for_power.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [elissa_heart](../flags/elissa_heart.md)</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>subtract variable:</li><ul><li>nbConnadh = 100000</li></ul></ul><li>increase witch king points large = yes</li><li>increase witch king points large = yes</li> | [Empowerment](#Z43_empowerment)<br /> |

| <a name="Z43_geainne">Geàinne</a><br />*The ease of controlling the connadh is not always as simple as ordering them to do as we will, their feeble minds can at times present a surprising amount of resistance to our whims. This cannot do, and it is exactly where our plans continue. The rings of such dense gold as to weigh like things fifteen times their size can be etched with the will of our mages and projected into the minds of our thralls to break their will and impose our own.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is legendary_enchant_tooltip</li><li>has ruler flag [enchantment_3](../flags/enchantment_3.md)</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is nbConnadh_100000_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>nbConnadh is at least 100000</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Geàinne](../events/geainne.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>subtract variable:</li><ul><li>nbConnadh = 100000</li></ul></ul> | [Delighted Mages](#Z43_delighted_mages)<br />[Imperial Gold](#Z43_imperial_golds)<br /> |

| <a name="Z43_sibhil_cad">Sibhil Cad</a><br />*Since time immemorial, elves of different social classes have been given different rights and been subject to different laws. Sicrheior's great modernization of Aelnar will end this practice, establishing a unified Sibhil Cad, or Code Civil.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is aelnar_sicrheior_is_alive_tooltip</li><li>has ruler flag [rianvisa_sicrheior](../flags/rianvisa_sicrheior.md)</li></ul><li>stability is at least 3</li><li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>is not at war</li> | <li>the event [Sibhil Càd](../events/sibhil_cad.md) happens</li> | [Independent Justice](#Z43_independant_justice)<br />[A New Constitution](#Z43_a_new_constitution)<br /> |

| <a name="Z43_a_new_constitution">A New Constitution</a><br />*Elven law is a tangled mess of tradition, norm, and custom. It is incredibly difficult simply to understand this political quagmire, let alone mobilize it to enact reform. Fortunately, Sicrheior's personal authority and influence have finally become secure enough to sweep away this backward system and rebuild Aelnar's government from the ground up with a simplified written constitution. This system will make the government more nimble and transparent.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>stability is at least 3</li><li>is not at war</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier aelnar_constitution until otherwise removed</li> |  |

| <a name="Z43_the_sicrheior_academy">The Sicrheior Academy</a><br />*Traditionally, officers in elvish armies are chosen for the virtue, honor, and martial valor. While romantic and beautiful, this system is archaic and anachronistic. The construction of an academy where prospective officers undergo rigorous and formal training will go a long way toward creating an army of professional soldiers.* | <li>army professionalism is at least 0.8</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>is not at war</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = aelnar_sicrheior_academy</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Expert Generals](#Z43_expert_generals)<br /> |

We must stabilize the country and move forward, if we want any hope of survival.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>legitimacy is at least 95</li><li>stability is at least 3</li> | <li>country gets the modifier aelnar_a_stable_aelnar for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="Z43_a_sinister_plan">A Sinister Plan</a><br />*Out in the wastes of Dalaire lies a single place hospitable enough to host a permanent settlement. The Stalwart Outpost, as the Cannorians call it. This spot, thanks to its remoteness and inhospitability, will be the perfect place to establish an underground complex that will serve as a base for intelligence coordination. On the surface, the settlement will be used for exiling the worst of Aelnar's rebels and heretics.* | <li>2787:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>is state</li><li>num of times improved by owner is at least 10</li></ul><li>mission completed is Z43_the_eclipse_concordat</li> | <li>2787:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = aelnar_underground_complex</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul> | [Country Stabilization](#Z43_country_stabilization)<br /> |

These agents have been tasked with the construction and coordination of the ruler's personal spy network. Their existence is not entirely secret, but their operations most certainly are.
