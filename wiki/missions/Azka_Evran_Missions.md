| <a name="azka_evran_last_human_king">The Last Human King</a><br />*The self-proclaimed Akal, Dartaxes szel-Forramaz, incited a rebellion in the northern holdings of Birzartanšes. His rebels managed to take the city of Akal-Uak and succeeded in not only holding the city but in expanding up the Saluraš river as well. His lands now border ours and a human kingdom on our doorstep presents almost as worrisome a problem as the goblins occupying the old capital.\n\nOn the other hand, it gives us an excuse to push south and seize Akal-Uak and the rest of the Saluraš river valley for ourselves without Birzartanšes getting in the way!* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Dartaxagerdim</li></ul><li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="azka_evran_end_of_the_journey">The End of The Journey</a><br />*We have come now to the end of the goblins’ exodus. We have nearly put our affairs back to as they were before the goblins invaded. The last of them must be driven out of Aqatbahar and with no significant presence to fall back to, their only options will be to flee back into the Serpentspine or north into Ourdia. We are so close to recovering everything the goblins took from us in the past century...\n\nThen we will have to look to the other outsiders on our borders.* | <li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier goblin_administration</li></ul></ul><li>type is all</li></ul><li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>harpylen area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>kuzak area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Cold as Marble](#azka_evran_cold_as_marble)<br /> |
| <a name="azka_evran_not_so_copper_bottomed">Not so Copper Bottomed</a><br />*The dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr have been in Bahar for millennia. We have usually had fair dealings with them, but they do control much of the trade that moves in the northern Divenhal and have always had a strong presence in the region. We should take control of the hold and its surroundings to take advantage of that control and to ensure easy access to dwarven expertise.\n\nOf course, they will have to officially convert to the Cult, something dwarves are notoriously not keen on doing. They think us foolish for worshipping elves as Surael’s chosen. Perhaps the old hold of Shazstundihr in the mountains north of Bazibar could be a refuge for the dwarves who do not wish to convert? It would be nice to know that the entrance to the Dwarovar is shut up by our dwarven subjects rather than enemies.* | <li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>2942:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>is not city</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Shazstundihr</li></ul><li>I11:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>the event [The Trail of Copper](../events/the_trail_of_copper.md) happens</li><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The End of The Journey](#azka_evran_end_of_the_journey)<br /> |
| <a name="azka_evran_kaltans_ambition">Kaltan's Dream</a><br />*Kaltan III Eletarzuir had a dream that he could unite all of Bahar under his righteous rule. It was a very lofty ambition, what with the rebels in Re’uyel, the copper dwarves, the crathánori, the more recent goblins. With so many obstacles, that last one proved too great to overcome for Kaltan.\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] wishes to see [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] fleet sailing around Gem Isle, the setting sun shimmering off their sails. All of Bahar will be a part of [Root.Country.GetName]. Then, we will work to convert the non-believers and push out the monsters, so that we may purify this land in the eyes of Surael and ensure peace and prosperity for centuries to come!* | <li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has region is bahar region, and does not have culture group is elven, and has culture group is bulwari, and has culture group is dwarven; and AND has religion is bulwari sun cult:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azka_evran_kaltan_ambition</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>east overmarch area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>south overmarch area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Not so Copper Bottomed](#azka_evran_not_so_copper_bottomed)<br /> |
| <a name="azka_evran_restitutor_baharis">Restitutor Baharis</a><br />*Bahar must be united under the rule of a strong Sun Elven monarch. The people must praise our ruler as they praise Surael and there can be no detractors left in our lands nor those who speak ill of us.\n\nOnce the goblins and harpies and other such monsters have been cast from our lands and once we have sealed up the entrance to the Serpentspine Mountains at Shazstundihr, our lands will be safe, at peace, and prospering. Truly then, we will have restored the lands of Bahar into a paradise for the faithful.* | <li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>culture group  is elven</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azka_evran_culture_is_human_tt</li><li>culture is human is yes</li></ul></ul><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azka_evran_10_province_prosperous_tt</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is bahar_region</li><li>is prosperous</li><li>value is at least 10</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = azka_evran_modifier_on_bahar_region_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is bahar region:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azka_evran_restitutor_baharis_modifier</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Kaltan's Dream](#azka_evran_kaltans_ambition)<br /> |

| <a name="azka_evran_cold_as_marble">Cold as Marble</a><br />*The goblins of the Marblehead Clan came out of the hills soon after the start of the Greentide. Many goblins sought to take ever finer land, setting their sights on cities that were out of their reach, and ultimately not managing to do much more than establish a position around them. Not so the goblins of Marblehead. They realized early that raiding was easier and safer and so a-raiding they went. With enough supplies and money from those raids, they were able to hire on many mercenaries and local humans who saw life under goblin rule as likely no different than elven rule.\n\nWith human-bolstered armies, the goblins marched out to Aqatbar, the capital of Baharkand, and laid siege. After Kaltan III was killed in the battle, along with his legitimate descendants, the goblins took up position in Aqatbar, naming it their new capital.\n\nOur first step must be to pry the city from goblin hands and liberate the surrounding lands. Once it is under our control, we can begin to look outward towards lands we have long coveted.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Marble Head Clan</li></ul><li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = azka_evran_claim_on_goblin_province_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bulwar superregion has owner has country modifier is goblin administration:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="azka_evran_better_sibling">The Better Sibling</a><br />*Though our dynasties are related, the rulers of Birzartanšes have always thought of themselves as the superior branch. After we were defeated by the goblins, they all but had permanent rights to claim so. The only way we can save dynastic face and prove to those arrogant fools that ours’ was the better sibling is to take their lands and force them to submit to us publicly.\n\nAnd for good measure, we shall seize the shaft of Dinatoldir that was given to Birzartans II by his father. We already have the head of the ancient lance of Jaher in our treasury, but to have the whole thing would bring us prestige by the cart full. We march south, to Birsartansbar!* | <li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Sack of Birsartansbar](../events/the_sack_of_birsartansbar.md) happens</li><li>anzarzax area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>anzabad area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>irrliam area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>lower brasan area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>upper brasan area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>medurubar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Last Human King](#azka_evran_last_human_king)<br />[Cold as Marble](#azka_evran_cold_as_marble)<br /> |
| <a name="azka_evran_jahers_spiritual_heir">Jaher's Spiritual Heir</a><br />*We will unite the lands that were first freed by Jaher, from Aqatbar to Brasan! The Teal Phoenix of Eletar will show Bulwar once and for all that we are the most worthy spiritual successor to Jaher’s greatness! If we can convince the clergy to publicly state this, perhaps in the great temples across Bulwar, we will be able to push through the rest of Bulwar with holy backing! No one would dare question the will of the Heir of Jaher!* | <li>anzarzax area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>anzabad area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>irrliam area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>lower brasan area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>government rank is at least 2</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has estate estate_church</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul></ul><li>prestige is at least 75</li><li>diplomatic reputation is at least 3</li> | <li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azka_evran_jaher_spiritual_heir</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>bulwar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>eduz vacyn area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Better Sibling](#azka_evran_better_sibling)<br /> |
| <a name="azka_evran_piercer_of_shadows">The Piercer of Shadows</a><br />*The spear, Dinatoldir, was carried long ago by Jaher himself during his liberation of Bulwar. It was later broken in battle and its two pieces gifted to the Akal of Birzartanšes. Now, many centuries later, we have reunited both parts of the spear, we have the clergy and the people looking to us to act and judge in Surael’s name and to show them the way to His Light.\n\nOur [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is Jaher in title and spirit, perhaps if we were to wield his mighty spear reforged, we might be Jaher given form on Halann anew. Send for our finest dwarven smiths and write letters to our allies with access to precursor relics and devices, we shall reforge Jaher’s ancient spear and carry it in triumph!* | <li>has country modifier spearhead_of_dinatoldir</li><li>has country modifier  shaft_of_dinatoldir</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li></ul><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azka_evran_precusor_relics_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is precursor_relics</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is precursor_relics</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has any owned province has trade goods is precursor relics:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -500</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>If random ally has any owned province has trade goods is precursor relics:</li><ul><li>the event [A Request for Relics](../events/a_request_for_relics.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>the event [Dinatoldir Reforged](../events/dinatoldir_reforged.md) happens</li> | [Not so Copper Bottomed](#azka_evran_not_so_copper_bottomed)<br /> |

Known throughout Bulwar as an unparalleled garrison force, they are some of the most disciplined and skilled troops in the land. In [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] time as captain of the Wallguard, [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to make many improvements to their function and skill and has proven himself a fine soldier and astute commander.\n\nNow, however, it is time to prove that he knows how to put those skills to use outside the walls of the fortress.

Once our control has been solidified, we can look out over Bahar as its king and no one will say that we do not deserve to rule over this land.

As the sun rises, it shines directly on me, illuminating the top of the temple where I stand before it hits any other part of the city. I step forward, and hold aloft Dinatoldir, angling it so that the sun reflects off it’s blade to shine from below as a beacon of His Light.\n\nThere is silence for a moment, as they look on me in awe and wonder. And then the world around me comes alive with the joyous singing of all those gathered below me. They sing a hymn beseeching Surael to guide them through the night, but it is to me they sing it, not to the rising sun but to [Root.Monarch.GetName] who reflects the sun upon the masses.

| <a name="azka_evran_joys_of_marriage">The Joys of Marriage</a><br />*The Joys of Marriage are many and it can be useful to have someone you trust. It can build bonds between groups and in the case of the nobility, it can raise or lower your status immediately. Even more so for kings, queens, and other higher rulers. Marriage for a king or queen must be about power and situation, to help maintain the safety and stability of their realm and this must be the case for [Root.Monarch.GetName]. As a bastard, a marriage to a noble house of high status and power would help legitimize [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] rule in the eyes of the other nobles of Bulwar.

More recently, in the days of the Phoenix empire, there was a link between the cities of Brasan and Port Jaher, in Businor. This link was established as a supply convoy between sections of the empire, but since its fall it has become an established trade route with the cities becoming cultural melting pots.\n\nThis has spurred the flow of knowledge and goods from west to east and east to west for centuries. But now, with Brasan so clearly inferior to our capital, Aqatbar, the merchants have begun to shift their interests. We ought to encourage this shift, let the link to the west be re-established in our lands so that all who come to Bulwar by sea, come by way of Aqatbar.* | <li>536:</li><ul><li>variable arithmetic trigger:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip is azka_evran_5_more_dev_than_brasan_tt</li><li>export to variable:</li><ul><li>which is aqatbarDevelopment</li><li>value is development</li><li>THIS</li></ul><li>export to variable:</li><ul><li>which is brasanDevelopment</li><li>value is development</li><li>565</li></ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which is brasanDevelopment</li><li>value is at least 5</li></ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is aqatbarDevelopment</li><li>which  is brasanDevelopment</li></ul></ul><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 40</li></ul></ul><li>565:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 20</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = azka_evran_steals_institution_spread_tt</li><li>set global flag [institutions_spread_to_aqatbar](../flags/institutions_spread_to_aqatbar.md)</li><li>565:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = city_of_ideas_brasan</li></ul><li>536:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azka_evran_entrepot_of_bulwar_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Well-Run Realm](#azka_evran_well_run_realm)<br /> |

The trees here grow large and tall but not very densely, with great plains stretching between clusters of them. The wood from these trees gets a light green tinge to its otherwise normal colour and becomes much stronger and more supple when spring arrives in the mountains and hills, melting great quantities of snow and ice to run down the Saluraš into the valley. The trees pull in vast amounts of water very quickly and after a week or two will start to shed small amounts of water. When cut at this stage, it produces Garvren.\n\nThis wood has been used for ships commissioned by rich merchants and lords for centuries, but we have gone one step further. The Garvren Fleet, as it is called, is made entirely of wood from Garvren trees and its light green hue shines brightly in the sun as it sails about the Divenhal keeping the people of the seas safe.* | <li>num of galley is at least 20</li><li>num of transport is at least 15</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Elizna</li></ul><li>num of galley is Elizna</li></ul> | <li>elizna area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>inner drolas area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>outer drolas area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier azka_evran_armada until otherwise removed</li> | [The Shipyards of Bahar](#azka_evran_shipyards_of_bahar)<br /> |
