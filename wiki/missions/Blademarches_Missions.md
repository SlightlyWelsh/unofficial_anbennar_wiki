| <a name="B33_vernham_school_of_sword">School of the Sword</a><br />*Before the Greentide, Vernham was renowned as city of swordmasters and many wealthy families sent their sons to be trained in the swordplay here. Sadly this tradition died off due to the troubles of last few decades and the city is now a shadow of its former glory.\n\nWe must rebuild what was lost to Korgus' horde and restore the Vernham School of the Sword!* | <li>808:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has building training_fields</li><li>has building  university</li><li>base manpower is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>808:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = blademarches_vernham_university</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = army_reformer</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [The Old Kingdom](#B33_the_old_kingdom_of_devaced)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_vernham_officer_training_curriculum">Officer Training</a><br />*Now that Vernham is once again center of swordplay, we should set up a military academy nearby to train our officers in strategy, tactics and self-defence. This will complement their skills in personal combat with the talent of leading an army, letting our commanders thrive in any situation. This will put our officers head and shoulders above the opposition.* | <li>808:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>army tradition is at least 50</li><li>grand captain is at least 3</li><li>mil power is at least 300</li> | <li>country gets the modifier blademarches_vernham_curriculum until otherwise removed</li><li>add mil power = -300</li> | [School of the Sword](#B33_vernham_school_of_sword)<br /> |

| <a name="B33_the_old_kingdom_of_devaced">The Old Kingdom</a><br />*When we were at our lowest, after losing Calindal to the Trialmount, the former Duchy of Devaced used the internal turmoil to split from us and carve out a nation of their own. Though we eventually managed to reclaim it, the western lands are once again outside our control, lost in the collapse of society in Escann.\n\nWhile they have been a part of our nation in the past, they also have spent time apart, which could give them the impression that their independence is permanent. We must dissuade them of this notion by any means necessary.* | <li>devaced area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>oudeben area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>vernham area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier blademarches_surge_of_newcomers for 20 years</li><li>If oudmerewood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If catelsvord area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Worthy Wielder](#B33_a_worthy_wielder)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_restore_old_vernham">Restore Old Vernham</a><br />*While the city of Vernham still stands today, it is not the same as Old Vernham. That Vernham stood to the west of the present day city, and was destroyed in the Greentide alongside its famous smithies, who provided mastercrafted swords for the swordmasters of its sister city. If we are to face the vast nation of Corvuria, we will require the metalworks of Vernham to produce their goods once again.* | <li>800:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>800:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = iron</li></ul><li>If dostans way area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Old Kingdom](#B33_the_old_kingdom_of_devaced)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_fortify_dostans_way">Fortify Dostan's Way</a><br />*Dostan's Way has served as a choke point between Dostanor and Escann proper since time immemorial, and it would be foolish to let this strategic position go to waste. We must construct a grand fortification, for if it cannot be the equal of Arca Corvur, it must at least get as close as possible.\n\nThis will both protect our citizens from gnollish ravagers and give us a base for further expeditions, especially into the lands of Corvuria.* | <li>803:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>army size is at least 30</li> | <li>If dostanor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Restore Old Vernham](#B33_restore_old_vernham)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_the_corvurian_campaigns">Pierce Corvuria</a><br />*While in the past the Castanorian citadel of Arca Corvur has stopped our expansion into Corvuria, it will block us no more. The ancient capital of Corvuria has fallen to our arms, and the way into central Corvuria is open. While there are certain to be battles ahead to secure Dostanor, at least they will be fought on the field, and not in muddy siege trenches.* | <li>baldostan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier blademarches_corvurian_integration for 10 years</li><li>add prestige = 15</li> | [Fortify Dostan's Way](#B33_fortify_dostans_way)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_into_the_folly">Into the Folly</a><br />*As our border with the gnoll infested marches of the Folly expands, it has become increasingly difficult to protect our people from the persistent raids by the Flamemarked Gnolls. It is time to bring these lands into the fold so that we bring these troublesome monsters to heel.* | <li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>804:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If daravans folly region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Colonizing the Folly](../events/colonizing_the_folly.md) happens</li> | [Pierce Corvuria](#B33_the_corvurian_campaigns)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_avenge_the_folly">Avenge the Folly</a><br />*Now that we are moving into the Folly a group of Marcher historians claims to have uncovered the place where our national hero Castan the Steward made his final stand against Xhazobain's hordes and was betrayed by Daravan. If we can prove this claim to be true, this will become a major pilgrimage site from all over Escann, and especially in the Marches. This will cement us once and for all as the rightful rulers of this swamp, not the heirs of Darvaran.* | <li>daravans folly region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>philosopher is at least 3</li> | <li>446:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = blademarches_grave_of_castan_the_steward</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change province name = "Steward's Grave"</li></ul><li>If west overmarch area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If east overmarch area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Into the Folly](#B33_into_the_folly)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_southern_marches">Southern Marches</a><br />*Now that we have managed to reclaim the Folly and integrate it into our nation, we must look towards the war-torn lands of Ourdia, and their great fortress of Bal Ouord. Not only does the fortress occupy a strategic chokepoint between the Serpentspine mountains and the sea, but it also controls the entrance to and from the Deepwoods, letting us secure our border against intruders from that cursed place.\n\nIf we are to control Dostanor, we must have Ourdia, and to have Ourdia, we must have Bal Ouord.* | <li>west overmarch area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>east overmarch area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>510:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = blademarches_bal_ouord_fortifications</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Avenge the Folly](#B33_avenge_the_folly)<br /> |

| <a name="B33_a_worthy_wielder">A Worthy Wielder</a><br />*For many years Calindal had no wielder and our nation had no ruler. Now the Marches have a ruler, and the ancient blade has been found. If our ruler can take the weapon as their own and prove their courage, we may finally be recognized as the true heir of the Marches!* | <li>has ruler modifier wielding_calindal</li><li>stability is at least 3</li><li>army size percentage is at least 1.0</li> | <li>If devaced area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If oudeben area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If vernham area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If escerfork area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If humacvord area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If blademarch area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If banesfork area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If clovenwood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If beastgrave area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="B33_towards_trialmount">Towards Trialmount</a><br />*For most of our mutual existences, Castanor was a rival of our nation and we regularly fought over the borderlands. We have for the most part managed to hold the east while Castanor held on to the banks of Silvermere. We should recover the lands we once owned and use them as a staging ground to take the rest of it.* | <li>escerfork area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>humacvord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If burnoll area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If themin area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Worthy Wielder](#B33_a_worthy_wielder)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_hegemon_of_south">Hegemon of the South</a><br />*After many years of conflict we have finally managed to reclaim our rightful place as the single most powerful realm in Southern Escann. While many would be content and rest on laurels, we are the holders of Calindal, the greatest blade ever forged. We deserve better, and we shall thus continue to expand. Onwards, to Casatnor!* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 45</li><li>region is south_castanor_region</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier blademarches_hegemon_of_the_south for 10 years</li> | [Towards Trialmount](#B33_towards_trialmount)<br />[Destroy the Griffin Riders](#B33_attack_on_marrhold)<br />[Fortify Dostan's Way](#B33_fortify_dostans_way)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_the_grand_army_of_blademarches">The Grand Army of the Blademarches</a><br />*If we are to take Castanor, we must have more than a sword, we must have an army. To that end, we must raise a larger force and make sure that they are trained for the wars to come.\n\nWhile melee will always have its place in combat, we must also utilize ranged weapons, and we will thus hire troops trained for this purpose. With the most powerful army to ever march across Escann and the world's most powerful sword, we will be unstoppable!* | <li>army size is at least 100</li><li>grand captain is at least 2</li> | <li>If southgate area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If castonath area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If trialmount area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Formation of the Bright Hussars](../events/formation_of_the_bright_hussars.md) happens</li> | [Hegemon of the South](#B33_hegemon_of_south)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_a_squanderer_redeemed">Redeem the Squanderer</a><br />*We have reclaimed the Trialmount and with it the grave of our most successful and disgraceful ruler, Elecast the Squanderer. He conquered Castanor, but in his arrogance he thought he could complete the trials of Castan with Calindal at his side. This lead to his death and the loss of the blade, which has not made him the most popular ruler. Now, with the blade regain and Castanor ours, we may once more celebrate his achievements, even if he did nearly cause us to lose everything.* | <li>southgate area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>trialmount area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>843:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = blademarches_grave_of_elecast</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Grand Army of the Blademarches](#B33_the_grand_army_of_blademarches)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_home_of_clarimonde">Home of Clarimonde</a><br />*With Oldhaven in our hands we control the birthplace of the heroine Clarimonde, one of our premiere national heroes. She went to the Trialmount and reclaimed the blade which had been lost by Elecast, saving the world from the Sorcerer-King and thereby saving our kingdom. Let her exploits be an inspiration to all of us!* | <li>oldhaven area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>has ruler modifier wielding_calindal</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>874:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = blademarches_home_of_clarimonde</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add adm power = -100</li> | [Redeem the Squanderer](#B33_a_squanderer_redeemed)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_the_stewards_war">The Steward's War</a><br />*The right of the Gleaming Blade means that we should rightfully rule all of Escann, no matter what the other adventurers or greenskins say. We must spread our rule from Bayvic to Marrhold, and from Bal Mire to Bal Ouord. It is time for Escann to be reforged in blood and steel. Let our enemies tremble when they hear Bright Hussars sound the charge!* | <li>prestige is at least 100</li><li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>army size is at least 100</li> | <li>If inner castanor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If west castanor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south castanor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Home of Clarimonde](#B33_home_of_clarimonde)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_imperial_blademarches">Imperial Blademarches</a><br />*In the old days our land was called the Kingdom of the Blade, with the name Blademarches only coming to prominence during our subordination to the powers of Castanor. We are once again a world power and so it is time to free ourselves of our shackled past, and claim or glorious future. Today, we proclaim ourselves the Empire of the Blade - a much more fitting name for a nation as mighty as ours!* | <li>total development is at least 1000</li><li>has ruler modifier wielding_calindal</li><li>mil is at least 5</li><li>dip is at least 5</li><li>adm is at least 5</li> | <li>country gets the modifier blademarches_might_of_the_empire until otherwise removed</li><li>override country name = EMPIRE_OF_THE_BLADE</li> | [The Steward's War](#B33_the_stewards_war)<br /> |

| <a name="B33_blademarches_proper">Blademarches Proper</a><br />*While we claim to be the rightful successor to the Blademarches, we do not control all of our De Jure territory, leading many to mock us as leaders of a rump kingdom. While we would normally disregard these lies, they do have a grain of truth, and we must rectify this immediately. After consolidating our lands, we could even push to more ambitious goals, but that is for the future. First, we must control our proper territory.* | <li>blademarch area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>banesfork area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>clovenwood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>beastgrave area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If medirleigh area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If swapstoke area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>817:</li><ul><li>move capital effect = yes</li></ul> | [A Worthy Wielder](#B33_a_worthy_wielder)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_the_eastern_marches">The Eastern Marches</a><br />*Though at times our hold of them was tenuous, the lands known as Eastern Marches are an integral part of the kingdom. This fertile land was often a point of conflict between us and the Marrodics, leading it to leave our hands often. Should we regain control over this region we can use it to strike down Marrhold before they recover from the horrors of the Greentide, nipping a potential long-term threat in the bud.* | <li>medirleigh area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>swapstoke area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If dryadsdale area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If hornwood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If doewood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If marrhold area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has 4097 has owned by is B36:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = B36</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 120</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Blademarches Proper](#B33_blademarches_proper)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_attack_on_marrhold">Destroy the Griffin Riders</a><br />*The Kingdom of Marrhold was our Eastern neighbor for centuries and we were often at odds over the exact border between our two nations. Now Marrhold is a shadow of their former glory, surviving the Greentide by hiding within their old dwarven hold, with their finest warrior and griffons being struck down by Orcs.\n\nThey have defeated us before in cowardly ways, such as throwing Godwin the Stoutheart into Silvermere because they could not defeat him honorably. This time, there will be nowhere to hide, and we shall destroy these moles once and for all!* | <li>marrhold area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If oldhaven area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier blademarches_veteran_army for 10 years</li> | [The Eastern Marches](#B33_the_eastern_marches)<br /> |
| <a name="B33_prepare_the_deepwoods_expedition">Prepare the Deepwoods Expedition</a><br />*To the south lay the Deepwoods, a large unending sea of trees, full of dangers unknown to the outside world. However, the aforementioned wood is highly valuable, and the area is currently in a period of intense strife. It would also increase our prestige, as not even Castan Beastbane managed to conquer these lands.

| <a name="B33_the_dragonfell_memorial">The Dragonfell Memorial</a><br />*Dragonfell is the place where our legendary founder Elecast Dragonsbane felled Alos the Copper during Dragonwake using Calindal, the sword which gives our nation its name. The modern Blademarches would not exist without his extraordinary deed, and we must commemorate it accordingly. We shall build a grand memorial to remember this crucial event, with a replica of the blade reaching far into the sky, signaling our continuing readiness for war and desire to protect the past.* | <li>816:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>philosopher is at least 3</li> | <li>816:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = blademarches_dragonfell_memorial</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Blademarches Proper](#B33_blademarches_proper)<br /> |

These renovations will allow us to send our heir to be trained by the finest knights of the realm, which will surely force them to toughen up.* | <li>819:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>819:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = blademarches_home_of_bladestewards</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Dragonfell Memorial](#B33_the_dragonfell_memorial)<br /> |
