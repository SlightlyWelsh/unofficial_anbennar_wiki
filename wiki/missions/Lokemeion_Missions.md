| <a name="G49_strengthen_values">Strengthen our Values</a><br />*Society has two extremes: one of civilization and one of barbarity. The main thing that separates them is the life in the kheion, an active political life of constant debate with your fellow citizens. It would do us well to encourage this behaviour.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add republican tradition = 10</li> |  |
| <a name="G49_protect_the_south">Protect the South</a><br />*Recent technological breakthroughs now allows us to extend the main protective function of our wards to our southern territory, with this we will effectively rid the area of one of its main concern: the Kaydhano.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>2743:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>2744:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>2778:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>2743:</li><ul><li>add permanent windward level:</li><ul><li>level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>2744:</li><ul><li>add permanent windward level:</li><ul><li>level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>2778:</li><ul><li>add permanent windward level:</li><ul><li>level = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Strengthen our Values](#G49_strengthen_values)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_farms_of_the_west">Farms of the West</a><br />*These newly conquered lands are most fitting for extensive farming communities, something that the natives clearly failed to set up. It is now in our hands to do so.* | <li>2748:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul><li>2751:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul><li>2752:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul><li>2753:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>2748:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = grain</li></ul><li>2751:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = grain</li></ul><li>2752:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = grain</li></ul><li>2753:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = grain</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_new_farms for 25 years</li> | [Protect the South](#G49_protect_the_south)<br />[Defeat the Barbarians](#G49_defeat_the_barbarians)<br /> |

| <a name="G49_alliance_in_the_north">Alliance in the North</a><br />*For many centuries the Kherkans were our closest allies. That is, until they tried to swindle us and receive a disproportionate amount of reparations from the foes we had defeated together. Since then our relationship has been in constant change; we should set it straight before we think of any further expansion.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Kherka</li><li>is rival is Kherka</li></ul> | <li>If paranego area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If geneltik area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="G49_seize_the_southern_tip">Seize the Southern Tip</a><br />*To our west lies the barbaric Eltibhar, a people who long ago invaded our lands and nearly destroyed our nation. But this was hundreds of years ago. Now that we hold a clear technological edge, we should start asserting our claims over these western peoples.* | <li>paranego area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>geneltik area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If eltikan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lokegentia area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Alliance in the North](#G49_alliance_in_the_north)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_defeat_the_barbarians">Defeat the Barbarians</a><br />*We are now in a position to strike at the heart of the barbarians. If we seize their capital, organized resistance will have finally been extinguished and we will have ended the largest threat to Kheionai civilization since times immemorial.* | <li>eltikan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>lokegentia area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>G60:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Seize the Southern Tip](#G49_seize_the_southern_tip)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_enlighten_the_elthibar">Enlighten the Elthibar</a><br />*Many foolishly believe that it is impossible to show the Eltibhar the light of civilization, that they would reject it without a thought. This cannot be true! Now that so many Eltibhar toil under us, it has become our burden to show them how to correctly live in society.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>paranego area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has owner religion</li></ul><li>geneltik area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has owner religion</li></ul><li>lokegentia area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has owner religion</li></ul><li>eltikan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has owner religion</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>paranego area:</li><ul><li>change culture = lokebhen</li></ul><li>geneltik area:</li><ul><li>change culture = eltibhen</li></ul><li>lokegentia area:</li><ul><li>change culture = eltibhen</li></ul><li>eltikan area:</li><ul><li>change culture = eltibhen</li></ul> | [Defeat the Barbarians](#G49_defeat_the_barbarians)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_civilized_times">Civilized Times</a><br />*Ours is a truly advanced society; we have succeeded in enlightening what were once mere barbarians and our people dedicate much of their time in the furthering the technological capabilities of the world.

| <a name="G49_the_land_of_dreams">The Land of Dreams</a><br />*Paraineg√≥, these hills are said to exude a natural aroma unlike any other. Some of our brightest philosophers claim that simply sleeping here will help enlighten the mind of any being. We could encourage this by constructing a place where they may rest and archive their new ideas.* | <li>2780:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul> | <li>change innovativeness = 6</li><li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_land_of_dreams until otherwise removed</li> | [Seize the Southern Tip](#G49_seize_the_southern_tip)<br />[Alecandi Knowledge](#G49_gather_alecandi_knowledge)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_the_mountain_library">The Mountain Library</a><br />*For some time now our researchers have been asking for a more isolated workplace, one nearer to the skies so that they may study the movement of the astral bodies. We seem have found the perfect spot.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>2779:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>2779:</li><ul><li>add building = university</li><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul> | [The Land of Dreams](#G49_the_land_of_dreams)<br /> |

| <a name="G49_renovation_of_the_grand_library">Renovate the Grand Library</a><br />*The Grand Library of Lokemeion is the single largest archive of knowledge known to the kheionai. Some, in fact, claim that it is older than the kheion that surrounds it. Recently, however, we shamefully have allowed the grand library to fall into disrepair. Let us start work on its renovation.* | <li>treasury is at least 250</li> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_renewed_the_grand_library for 30 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G49_gather_alecandi_knowledge">Alecandi Knowledge</a><br />*Though we have restored much of the infrastructure of the grand library, many of its halls now lie empty. The library needs not to only have old tomes, it is time that we also begin bringing in new knowledge. We shall start by studying what our fellow Alecandi have learned over the last few years.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>any country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>region is alecand_region</li></ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>2745:</li><ul><li>add building = university</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_alecandi_diplomacy for 15 years</li> | [Renovate the Grand Library](#G49_renovation_of_the_grand_library)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_devandi_ideals">Devandi Ideals</a><br />*Devand is filled with hardworking Kheionai; many migrate to those lands, abandoning their secure lives in Alecand, in hope of establishing a better future for themselves and their families. This mentality is one that would be most interesting to research, and it seems that they have created a library on the town of Trilidir. Let us begin our studies from there.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>2708:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_devandi_inspiration for 25 years</li><li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_colonial_drive for 50 years</li> | [Alecandi Knowledge](#G49_gather_alecandi_knowledge)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_visitors_from_far_away_lands">Visitors from Far Away Lands</a><br />*Cannorians, this is what these new people who sail great vessels call themselves. They claim to come from an entirely different, and distant, continent. It could be beneficial for us to approach them in a friendly manner, as it is currently hard to gauge the innovations that they may bring.* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is anbennarian</li><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>2745:</li><ul><li>add next institution embracement = 100</li></ul> | [Devandi Ideals](#G49_devandi_ideals)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_the_western_center_of_learning">Western Seat of Learning</a><br />*The pursuit of knowledge is one that is never truly over. However, we have undoubtedly restored the grand library to its glory as a great center of learning, not only for the Kheionai but for the entire world. A golden age dawns upon us.* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li> | <li>2745:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "western_center_of_learning"</li><li>duration = 36500</li></ul></ul> | [The Mountain Library](#G49_the_mountain_library)<br />[Visitors from Far Away Lands](#G49_visitors_from_far_away_lands)<br />[The Eastern Library](#G49_the_eastern_library)<br /> |

| <a name="G49_wisdom_from_the_exiled">Wisdom from the Exiled</a><br />*The Ambhen are a curious people; many centuries ago their ancestors rebelled against the great kheions and for a short time ruled the Devandi territories. After being driven off by a great army, these now exiled people have rebuilt anew isolated from their fellow Kheionai. Even in this isolation, they have managed to keep technological parity. We must learn of their secrets.* | <li>2620:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_exiled_thoughts for 25 years</li> | [Alecandi Knowledge](#G49_gather_alecandi_knowledge)<br /> |
| <a name="G49_the_eastern_library">The Eastern Library</a><br />*The Taychendi are a recent find, numerous and somewhat backwards. Many merchants and generals turn their greedy eyes towards them. Our interest, on the other hand, lies somewhere else; some preliminary excursion tells us of a vast library on their western shore. This is a veritable treasure trove, which we likely will be able to spend several years translating and moving to Lokemeion.* | <li>2541:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier lokemeion_eastern_knowledge for 25 years</li> | [Wisdom from the Exiled](#G49_wisdom_from_the_exiled)<br /> |
