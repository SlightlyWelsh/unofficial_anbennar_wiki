| <a name="J33_setup_the_fur_trade">The Fur Trade</a><br />*With the consolidation of the vast trapping grounds of the mainland under our government, we can massively increase their efficiency. The trappers who had been able to get around regulations by simply crossing a border will now have to pay their due, and we can implement regulations to prevent over-hunting.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>trade goods is fur</li><li>region is yyl_moista_region</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier federation_fur_trade for 100 years</li> | [A Stable Island](#J33_a_stable_island)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_haven_of_peace">Haven of Peace</a><br />*While much of our mainland territory is still subject to intermittent centaur or ogre raids, the shores of Lake Taeganyuul are an exception. It has become a center where the resources of the plains can be consolidated before being shipped downriver to the islands beyond, and thus it has experienced massive growth.* | <li>lake shore:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is province_is_prosperous</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul> | <li>lake shore:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 20</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li> | [The Fur Trade](#J33_setup_the_fur_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_trade_hub">Trade Hub</a><br />*The continued growth of the area around lake Teaganyuul has particularly boosted the fortune of the city of Valakorma, which is in a prime position to receive goods from downriver. Recently, its reputation has grown to international heights, as those who cannot or are unwilling to make the long voyage from Cannor instead purchase the Lake's finest goods here.* | <li>lake shore:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>5110:</li><ul><li>If has province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Haven of Peace](#J33_haven_of_peace)<br /> |

| <a name="J33_a_stable_island">A Stable Island</a><br />*Before we can think of expansion, we must secure our home.

| <a name="J33_a_prosperous_federation">A Prosperous Federation</a><br />*With the unification of our islands has come greater economic growth than we have ever seen before.

| <a name="J33_establishing_contact">Establishing Contacts</a><br />*During our period of division, many governments across the Federation became convinced that we would never find anyone else who did not want to kill or eat us, assuming we would be isolated forever. With unification however, rumors have reached us of others nations and races, ones less aggressive than the ogres or centaurs. Let us contact these powers, and make clear our good intentions.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is forbidden_lands_superregion</li></ul></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier federation_establishing_contact for 50 years</li> | [A Prosperous Federation](#J33_a_prosperous_federation)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_sustaining_the_nation">Sustaining the Nation</a><br />*Many in recent years have questioned the financial stability of our government, citing the vast campaigns of colonization and consolidation. While these assertions obviously have no basis in fact, our coffers have been looking a little light lately. If we are to ensure a bright future for all of the Lake, we must first ensure our economy is in order.* | <li>current income balance is at least 350</li> | <li>country gets the modifier federation_sustaining_the_nation for 50 years</li> | [Establishing Contacts](#J33_establishing_contact)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_the_trading_crescent">The Trading Crescent</a><br />*From the northern forests to the southern mountains, the Federation stands as the master of the lakes. Free from fear of attack, our merchants may go wherever they please, bringing civilization with them.

| <a name="J33_between_sea_and_mountain">Between Sea and Mountain</a><br />*To the south of our land, in an area referred to by the centaurs as Nuzur Bokh, lies very little population or infrastructure. It does however boast plentiful forests, abundant natural resources, and an extremely defensible position. We should settle this barren land, and make it a worthy compatriot to the cities of the lakes.* | <li>nuzurbokh region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add years of income = 1</li><li>add prestige = 20</li> | [A Stable Island](#J33_a_stable_island)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_administratif_center">Administrative Center</a><br />*Now that we have claimed the Nuzur Bokh, we are facing an unexpected problem. In the past, we have been able to use ships to convey orders from the capital to the provinces, but this strategy does not work in this land devoid of rivers. The only solution seems to be to give the region autonomy, and any autonomous region will need a suitable capital.* | <li>5202:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>5202:</li><ul><li>If has province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Between Sea and Mountain](#J33_between_sea_and_mountain)<br /> |

| <a name="J33_guns_tournament">Guns Tournament</a><br />*A question has been troubling many within our nation for quite some time, and it is one of utmost importance. Who is the greatest gunman in the Federation? One of our advisors has recommended a series of grand tournaments, both to provide entertainment and to help us identify the best in the land.* | <li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>mil power is at least 300</li> | <li>add dip power = -300</li><li>add mil power = -300</li><li>add adm power = -300</li><li>custom tooltip = guns_tournament_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [federation_guns_tournament](../flags/federation_guns_tournament.md)</li></ul> | [Guns Culture](#J33_guns_culture)<br /> |

However, we have discovered a new materiel, one with substantial anti magic properties. Let's see how smug the mages are when they take a black bullet to the face!* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is damestear</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>is year is at least 1750</li> | <li>country gets the modifier federation_black_bullet until otherwise removed</li> | [State of the Art Gunsmithery](#J33_state_of_the_art_gunsmithery)<br /> |

| <a name="J33_the_9th_amendment">The 9th Amendment</a><br />*Perhaps the most important amendment to our Constitution is the 9th, which guarantees the right to bear arms. This extends beyond mere rifles however, as we will tolerate no infringement upon our right to defend ourselves. A cannon is, after all, a large firearm.* | <li>mil power is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>add mil power = -500</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier federation_9th_amendment_1 until otherwise removed</li> |  |
| <a name="J33_the_ends">The Ends</a><br />*A gun is useless without the man to wield it. No matter how hard this fact is to confront, we must face it, and adjust our training procedures accordingly. A skilled soldier in our military has come forward with a plan to increase fire discipline among our troops, to turn them into an army rather than a paid mob of armed men.* | <li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.5</li></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>skill = 3</li><li>type = commandant</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [The 9th Amendment](#J33_the_9th_amendment)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_blue_drill">Blue Drill</a><br />*Our troops are now the most disciplined in the world, able to blow any enemy away. They all fire together, but unlike other armies, can actually aim. They have trained with guns since childhood, and carry weapons that any enemy army will learn to fear.* | <li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.75</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier federation_blue_drill until otherwise removed</li> | [The Ends](#J33_the_ends)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_the_BFC">The BFC</a><br />*Our gunsmiths are the finest in the world, a fact they have recently proved. Working together in great secrecy, our finest craftsmen have created the largest cannon the world has ever seen, the appropriately named BFC. Its power is incredible and should be more than enough to deal with any threat, even those from beyond the mortal plane.* | <li>mil tech is at least 16</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Rule Britannia"</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>innovativeness is at least 20</li><li>mil power is at least 500</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>mil power is at least 350</li></ul> | <li>If has dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>If does not have innovativeness is 20:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -500</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -350</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier federation_the_bfc until otherwise removed</li> | [Blue Drill](#J33_blue_drill)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_the_442nd">The 442nd</a><br />*In the many gun tournaments held across the land, a few top contenders have emerged. They are adored by the crowds, but they could serve the nation better by fighting. They will be conscripted into a new 442nd regiment, which will always be at the front of our armies, always being ready to go for broke in battle.* | <li>mil power is at least 300</li><li>any enemy country:</li><ul><li>military strength:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 1.1</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = -300</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_442nd</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [The BFC](#J33_the_BFC)<br />[Guns Culture](#J33_guns_culture)<br /> |

Therefore, we shall create a new decoration, the Blue Star of Honor, which shall be awarded only to finest soldiers. All shall be motivated by the chance of winning this coveted medal, showing the glorious Lone Star of our flag, marking them as exemplars of what makes our country great.* | <li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.95</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier federation_the_blue_star_of_honor until otherwise removed</li> | [Guns Tournament](#J33_guns_tournament)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_a_floating_gun">A Floating Gun</a><br />*Guns, as a general rule, cannot float, and thus we have neglected our navy. However, some of our admirals have come together with a plan to make a ship, tentatively called the floating gun. It will have very little on board to minimize weight, which will allow us to make it the most heavily armed ship ever created.* | <li>num of heavy ship is at least 50</li> | <li>custom tooltip = a_floating_gun_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [a_floating_gun](../flags/a_floating_gun.md)</li></ul> | [Blue Star of Honor](#J33_the_blue_star_of_honor)<br />[State of the Art Gunsmithery](#J33_state_of_the_art_gunsmithery)<br /> |

| <a name="J33_creating_the_military_council">The Military Council</a><br />*If we are ever to defeat the vile centaurs, our army must be as strong as possible. Therefore, we shall assemble a council of our finest generals to constantly plan coordinate our army movements. Many have objected to this on the basis that it will permanently turn us towards war, but any sacrifices must be accepted in our quest to free the plains.* | <li>mil power is at least 350</li><li>government is republic</li> | <li>add mil power = -350</li><li>add government reform = military_council_reform</li> | [Refit the Navy](#J33_refit_the_navy)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_to_serve_and_protect">To Serve and Protect</a><br />*Whenever a soldier enlists in our military, they must take a simple oath, that they must follow at all times. They must pledge to serve and protect the citizens of the lake, and they must follow this code at all times. If they ever violate the code by attacking an innocent citizen or any other offense as determined by the military council, then they are executed, as they have fallen to the level of the honor-less centaurs.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>stability is at least 3</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.7</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 350</li></ul> | <li>If does not have professionalism equivalent has VAL is 0.7:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -350</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier federation_to_serve_and_protect until otherwise removed</li> | [The Military Council](#J33_creating_the_military_council)<br />[Leading by Example](#J33_leading_by_examples)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_strategical_readyness">Strategical Readiness</a><br />*While our soldiers are well trained, there are not very many of them. If we lost even one critical battle, our army would be incredibly understrength until new men could be raised. We should establish a system of reserves across the Triunic cities to make sure that we are ready, no matter what challenges come our way.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>barracks is at least 20</li><li>training fields is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier federation_strategical_readyness until otherwise removed</li> | [To Serve and Protect](#J33_to_serve_and_protect)<br /> |
| <a name="J33_tactical_readyness">Tactical Readiness</a><br />*The major advantage that the raiders have held over us in the past is their movement speed, with them being able to flee whenever we have been able to defeat. Our troops must be specifically trained for pursuit, and our generals must know the value of speed. The horsemen will be able to run no more.* | <li>num of generals is at least 5</li><li>mil tech is at least 24</li> | <li>country gets the modifier federation_tactical_readyness until otherwise removed</li> | [Strategical Readiness](#J33_strategical_readyness)<br /> |

This is the chant uttered across innumerable battlefields, repeated at funerals, and the final words the centaurs hear before the end of their pitiful lives. It shows the unwavering commitment of the Triunic people to destroy those who oppressed them, and to repay what was dealt to them one hundred fold. * | <li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is land_morale</li><li>value is at least 0.6</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier federation_the_kukaein until otherwise removed</li> | [Tactical Readiness](#J33_tactical_readyness)<br /> |

To remedy this, we will employ a new battle tactic that focuses on luring the centaurs towards the center of the army, and once they are there, the trap shall be sprung. Our flanking infantry will quickly circle around them, trapping the monsters and letting us finish them off.* | <li>mil tech is at least 26</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>custom tooltip = center_peel_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [center_peel_unit](../flags/center_peel_unit.md)</li></ul> | [The Kukaein](#J33_the_kukaein)<br /> |

| <a name="J33_reshape_the_army">Reshape The Army</a><br />*The formation of the Federation has brought together many different city militaries, all with different ideas of how to run the army. To remedy this, we will appoint an overall army chief with the specific goal of promoting unity among our soldiers. They must learn to serve Sojdalasät, not their individual cities.* | <li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.5</li></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = army_reformer</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="J33_leading_by_examples">Leading by Example</a><br />*While we our soldiers are incredibly courageous, their leaders are much less so. Many of them are holdovers from the old city armies, only experienced at fighting over fishing rights. We must address this immediately by forcing officers to lead from the front, which will both help us identify the bravest among them and weed out those who should never have joined the army in the first place.* | <li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is land_morale</li><li>value is at least 0.4</li></ul><li>government is republic</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier federation_the_unit_1 until otherwise removed</li><li>add government reform = leading_by_example_reform</li> | [Reshape The Army](#J33_reshape_the_army)<br />[Refit the Navy](#J33_refit_the_navy)<br /> |

Our harbourmasters, merchants, and others are suddenly beginning to find themselves strained as the sheer amount of goods being bought and sold, and brought into and out of the federation, has become far too much to monitor. Some claim their wares are taxed twice by the same institution, while others allege that illicit and banned goods are able to freely enter our markets and be sold in broad daylight... accusations we cannot deny.

Few have ever shaped the Triunics or our way of life - beast and geography alike have seen to it. But for every fact, there is an exception. We call them “the people of the Moduk”.\n\nVast and difficult to traverse, the lands of the Moduk lack any centralised authority. Instead, each tribe is governed completely independently of one another, with their own chieftains and laws. The method of determining the chieftain, too, whether through election or inheritance, varies from tribe to tribe. They are a disparate people, fighting either side by side, or brother against brother - a land much like our own.\n\nBut no matter who came to control the natural harbour where the treasure fleet would restock their supplies for the great journey ahead, the Moduk have always approached us with great respect - and in turn, we have shown the same. It is after all, thanks to the Moduk that we are able to reach Haless. It is thanks to them, to their kindness and courage, that we are not alone.\n\nThrough our conquests, we have united the woodlands - the spirits here differ from those back home, they are far stronger. The land has not been tainted and scarred by Centaur filth, or by the might of industry. Instead the land expresses its untamed manners through serenity.

But more than that, the rünsukhi await the day that civilization will return to the desert, and persist in their homes against their hardships. The shuvüüsh meanwhile fled for their lives, becoming three separate peoples as they followed three brothers. Ghastly familiar. But more than that, both peoples share some similarities with us not found elsewhere in Haless - at times not even in Beikdugang. Clothing, words, and dances. There are similarities here that make it undeniable that we have a link - a bond. They too have recognized this, and many in their numbers are beginning to see themselves as part of the federation.
