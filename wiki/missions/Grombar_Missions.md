| <a name="Z50_forced_marriages">Forced Marriages</a><br />*The Reachmen Lords, though having decades ago submitted to orcish rule, still harbor some degree of rebelliousness, and some may still have loyalty to the old human domain of Bal Vroren. In order to ensure their continued loyalty, both today and for generations to come, we will present these human lords with orcish consorts. Not only will this ensure their loyalty in the short-term, as they will be unlikely to wish to go against their spouses, in the long-term as well, half-orcs are far more likely to be loyal to our new kingdom than humans.\n\nRefusing these marriages will not be an option.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Esald</li></ul><li>Z23:</li><ul><li>vassal of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Rivsby</li></ul><li>Z48:</li><ul><li>vassal of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Eskerborg</li></ul><li>Z49:</li><ul><li>vassal of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add splendor = 100</li><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 10</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = grombar_royal_marriages_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has exists is Z23:</li><ul><li>Z23:</li><ul><li>the event [Forced Marriage](../events/forced_marriage.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Z48:</li><ul><li>Z48:</li><ul><li>the event [Forced Marriage](../events/forced_marriage.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Z49:</li><ul><li>Z49:</li><ul><li>the event [Forced Marriage](../events/forced_marriage.md) happens</li></ul></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="Z50_trade_priviliges_for_cedevik">Trade Privileges for Cedevik</a><br />*During Brasur's conquest of Vrorenmarch, the lord of Cedevik was one of many who refused to submit to the new Grey King, but after months under siege, the powerful merchants of Cedevik, of sounder mind than their foolish liege, realized the inevitability of Brasur's conquest and opened the city’s gates. Brasur rewarded them by executing the lord and instead establishing a mercantile republic. Loyal to the Gray King of course.\n\nIt is time, now, to remind them of the many benefits of our rule. By selling some of our trading rights to them, we will obtain some much-needed coin, and ensure their loyalty in the years to come.* | <li>exists is Cedevik</li><li>Z27:</li><ul><li>vassal of is this nation</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier "grombar_agreement_with_cedevik" for 50 years</li><li>Z27:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_independent_trade_centre"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>If has overlord has tag is Z18:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = Z18</li><li>modifier = grombar_trade_privileges</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = Z50</li><li>modifier = grombar_trade_privileges</li></ul></ul></ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = Z27</li><li>modifier = grombar_trade_privileges</li></ul> | [First Orcish Kingdom](#Z50_first_orcish_kingdom)<br /> |

| <a name="Z50_subjugate_goblins">Subjugate Goblins</a><br />*During the Greentide, a goblin tribe known as the Hideguzzlers crossed the borders of our new kingdom, establishing themselves atop the great mountain of Gulletpeak. A constant thorn in our side since their arrival, we must bring Gulletpeak under our control, not only to establish a strategic defensive position against the southern adventurers, but to show once and for all that the strength of the Gray King is not to be underestimated.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Hideguzzler</li></ul><li>733:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>734:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier "grombar_goblin_workforce" for 10 years</li><li>the event [The Fate of Gulletpeak](../events/the_fate_of_gulletpeak.md) happens</li> | [Unite Gray Orcs](#Z50_unite_gray_orcs)<br /> |

| <a name="Z50_religious_syncretism">Dookan Syncretism</a><br />*We are not interested in spreading the faith of Dookan amongst our human subjects. After all, only the strongest are worthy to follow in Dookan’s wake. Rather, it is simply far easier for all involved to allow the humans to continue to worship the gods of their ancestors. After all, the weak seem to feel some sort of need to believe in something, and who are we to deny them some form of solace?\n\nThe humans must be reminded, however, that though their faiths are tolerated within our lands, Dookan still reigns supreme over all of divinity.* | <li>ruler is half orcish is yes</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>ruler has personality is free_thinker_personality</li><li>full idea group is humanist_ideas</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "grombar_dookan_syncretism" for 50 years</li> | [King of Orcs and Humans](#Z50_king_of_orcs_and_humans)<br /> |

| <a name="Z50_rebuild_garok">Rebuild Garok</a><br />*Esald, or Garok in Orcish, is one of the oldest and biggest cities of the Alenic Reach. In fact, due to its central location, it may well serve as a potential new capital for the Gray Kings. But if Garok is to serve a new capital of Grombar it will require a mightier population, and the infrastructure to support it. As such, we will entice orcs from the surrounding lands to move to the city. Combined with construction efforts to revitalise the old infrastructure, we shall turn Garok into a cultural and economic centre, built in collaboration between both orcs and humans.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>701:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul></ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>701:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Brand New Kingdom](#Z50_brand_new_kingdom)<br /> |
| <a name="Z50_rebuild_bastan_duskur">Rebuild Bastan-Duskur</a><br />*Bastan-Duskur, known to the Reachmen as Cedevik, has long served as the economic heart of our kingdom, a center of trade and commerce to rival any other in the Giant’s Grave. However, the city’s buildings are old, and its population is still dominated by humanity. Like we have done in Garok, we will encourage orcish migration to the city, as well as investing vast amounts in revitalising the city’s infrastructure, to create a city that is not just the equal of all others in the Giant’s Grave, but the greatest city in the sea, envy to all others!* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>717:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul></ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>717:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Rebuild Garok](#Z50_rebuild_garok)<br /> |
| <a name="Z50_repopulate_alenic_reach_cities">Repopulate the Reach</a><br />*Over centuries of war and conflict, the cities of the Reach have seen a great decline. Across the southern coast of the Giant’s Grave, entire districts of cities stand empty, with there simply not being enough humans to populate them. We will rectify this situation; a wave of orcish and half-orcish settlers shall be sent westwards, in order to join the Reachmen in the building of our cities to ever-greater heights.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 12</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is mawriver_area</li><li>area  is serpentshead_area</li><li>area   is dinesck_area</li><li>area    is west_chillsbay_area</li><li>area     is northern_greatwoods_area</li></ul><li>is city</li><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>If random owned province has area is serpentshead area, and has area is dinesck area, and has area is west chillsbay area; and does not have province modifier is grombar growing population:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has area is serpentshead area, and has area is dinesck area, and has area is west chillsbay area; and does not have province modifier is grombar growing population:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has area is serpentshead area, and has area is dinesck area, and has area is west chillsbay area; and does not have province modifier is grombar growing population:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has area is serpentshead area, and has area is dinesck area, and has area is west chillsbay area; and does not have province modifier is grombar growing population:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has area is serpentshead area, and has area is dinesck area, and has area is west chillsbay area; and does not have province modifier is grombar growing population:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Rebuild Bastan-Duskur](#Z50_rebuild_bastan_duskur)<br /> |
| <a name="Z50_repopulation_of_gerudian_cities">Repopulation of Gerudian Cities</a><br />*Both Redgarhavn and Konungrhavn, greatest of the Gerudian cities, strongly resisted our conquest, and as such have been greatly damaged during the many wars against the realms of the far north. Our settlers will repopulate these cities and develop them into great centers of Grombar like their sister cities to the south. After all, what better fate could befall these lands than serving as the beginning of yet more integration of humanity into the realm of the orcs?* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>956:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>975:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>956:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>975:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>If has owner has primary culture is grombar half orc:</li><ul><li>change culture = grombar_half_orc</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change culture = half_orc</li></ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_growing_population"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Repopulate the Reach](#Z50_repopulate_alenic_reach_cities)<br /> |

In addition, our colonies in the Northern pass have lagged behind in population, with many orcs not wanting to leave for the much harsher, frozen lands of the east.

Now, when a southerner visits the north, they see a land not of humans or orcs, but of half-orcs, the true heirs to Grombar’s future.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 60</li><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li></ul><li>high tolerance human race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance half orcish race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance orcish race trigger is yes</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is human is yes</li><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is opinion_expelling_race</li></ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is opinion_purging_race</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "grombar_strong_and_disciplined" for 100 years</li> | [Grombari Melting Pot](#Z50_grombari_melting_pot)<br /> |

Across Escann, and even in Aelantir, new half-orc realms are being established. In order to secure the continued existence of half-orcs on the continent, we must take our half-orc brothers under the protective wing of the kingdom of Grombar.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is grombar_brother_countries_tooltip</li><li>num of subjects is at least 2</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul> | <li>largest increase of human tolerance effect = yes</li><li>largest increase of half orcish tolerance effect = yes</li><li>largest increase of orcish tolerance effect = yes</li> |  |

| <a name="Z50_strong_kingdom_policy">Strong Kingdom Policy</a><br />*Though some would argue that all races are equally strong in their own way, it is clear to us that orcs and half-orcs are stronger than others. The fact of the matter is that in this world, the strong rule, and the weak are conquered. It just so happens that in every case in Grombar, the strong are orcs, and the weak are everyone else.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>largest decrease of human tolerance effect = yes</li><li>largest decrease of goblin tolerance effect = yes</li><li>largest increase of half orcish tolerance effect = yes</li><li>largest increase of orcish tolerance effect = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier "grombar_strong_kingdom_policy" until otherwise removed</li> |  |
| <a name="Z50_weak_do_not_live_in_grombar">No Home for the Weak</a><br />*The core lands of Grombar, the center of our kingdom, must be fully settled by the strong. The humans, quite clearly, after all of their lands that we have conquered, are weak. After all, had they not been weak, they would not have been conquered by Grombar in the first place. Thus, it is only right that these lands become home of only the strongest.* | <li>east chillsbay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul><li>wudhal area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul><li>sondaar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul><li>vrorenwall area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul><li>cedesck area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul><li>gulletpeak area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul><li>vrorenmarch area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul> | <li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "grombar_strong_kingdom_1" until otherwise removed</li> | [Strong Kingdom Policy](#Z50_strong_kingdom_policy)<br /> |
| <a name="Z50_human_segregation">Human Segregation</a><br />*Humans, being weak, have lost the right to exist alongside orcs in the core of Grombar. This is not cruelty on the Gray King’s part, but rather mercy. By banishing the human population to the cold, harsh regions on the fringes of Grombar, it may well be that the humans will someday become strong enough to rejoin wider orcish society. Who knows, in a few centuries they may even be considered our equals, as ridiculous as that sounds. For now, though, humanity has been segregated from orckind, purely for the betterment of the humans, of course.* | <li>gerudia superregion:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>area is sidaett_area</li><li>area  is gullmork_area</li><li>area   is gifrbygd_area</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is half orcish is yes</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul></ul><li>sidaett area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>culture is human is yes</li></ul><li>gullmork area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>culture is human is yes</li></ul><li>gifrbygd area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>culture is human is yes</li></ul> | <li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 50</li></ul><li>remove country modifier = grombar_strong_kingdom_1</li><li>country gets the modifier "grombar_strong_kingdom_2" until otherwise removed</li><li>sidaett area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_frontier_settlements"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>gullmork area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_frontier_settlements"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>gifrbygd area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "grombar_frontier_settlements"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [No Home for the Weak](#Z50_weak_do_not_live_in_grombar)<br /> |
