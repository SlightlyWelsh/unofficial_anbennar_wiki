Through a combination of encouragement to our own populace to migrate, and inviting colonists from Small Country to join ours, we should be able to offset this difference.* | <li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier hierarchy_lots_of_colonists for 100 years</li> | [Discover Aelantir](#hierarchy_discover_aelantir)<br /> |
