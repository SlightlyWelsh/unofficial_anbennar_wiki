| <a name="caamas_sponsor_naval_infrastructure">Sponsor Naval Infrastructure</a><br />*The Caamas are known for their naval traditions, unafraid of the sea. The Summer sun shines on the Sarmadfar sea, and the Elarbarc teems with the humblest fishing boats, the most formidable warships, and more. We must ensure that ships loyal to our cause remain plentiful and undiminished by our rivals.* | <li>navy size percentage is at least 0.9</li><li>num of admirals is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "caamas_shipbuilding_boom" for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="caamas_prepare_for_southern_eordan_expedition">A Southern Expedition</a><br />*To the south of Eordand lies an arid peninsula inhabited by the Fograc, a people who long ago rejected the Eordellon faith. These lands would be of little interest were it not for the presence of Precursor ruins. Let us send an Eordan Expedition out, to find these ruins and the knowledge that has been left behind.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of missionaries is at least 2</li><li>num of colonists is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>create explorer:</li><ul><li>tradition = 50</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "arakeprun_expedition_preparation" for 10 years</li><li>the event [Expedition Preparations Ready](../events/expedition_preparations_ready.md) happens</li> | [Sponsor Naval Infrastructure](#caamas_sponsor_naval_infrastructure)<br />[Favor of the Merchant Lords](#caamas_curry_favor_from_merchant_lords)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_convert_the_fograc">Convert the Fograc</a><br />*The first step of our expedition should be to enlist the help of the Fograc. Although they had rejected our faith, they are our wayward brethren. If we would show them the light of our ways, perhaps they could help us in our expedition?* | <li>2056:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>religion is this nation</li></ul><li>2055:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>religion is this nation</li></ul><li>2054:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>religion is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "arakeprun_integration_of_the_fograc" for 15 years</li><li>2056:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>2055:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul> | [A Southern Expedition](#caamas_prepare_for_southern_eordan_expedition)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_whispers_among_the_sands">Whispers in the Sands</a><br />*The Fograc tell of a place buried underneath the desert to the southeast by the edge of the Haraf desert. This must be the site we are looking for, the expedition must be set forth there immediately and start the excavation!* | <li>owns core province 2060</li><li>2060:</li><ul><li>development is at least 8</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1.25</li> | <li>the event [Excavation of Cadcimn](../events/excavation_of_cadcimn.md) happens</li><li>add years of income = -1.25</li> | [Convert the Fograc](#caamas_convert_the_fograc)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_unearthed_knowledge_of_cadcimn">Knowledge of Lost Cadcimn</a><br />*It has been many years since the Eordan Expedition has started excavating Cadcimn, and many wonders have been found. However, until now only small artifacts and chambers have been found. Now large portions of the original structure have been found, mostly intact. This is a true breakthrough, exactly what we have been missing all this time. We must explore further!* | <li>2060:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>adm tech is at least 10</li><li>years of income is at least 1.75</li> | <li>the event [Foray into the Depths of Cadcimn](../events/foray_into_the_depths_of_cadcimn.md) happens</li><li>add years of income = -1.75</li><li>2060:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Whispers in the Sands](#caamas_whispers_among_the_sands)<br /> |

| <a name="caamas_curry_favor_from_merchant_lords">Favor of the Merchant Lords</a><br />*The Merchant Lords of the Caamas, not always noble by blood, ply the seas with their armadas of trading ships. They are the ones who truly control the trade on the waves, and if we seek to achieve dominance on the seas over our rivals we must impress them with a sizable fleet. For the Merchant Lords are known to only negotiate with those that impress them with force that might threaten them.* | <li>prestige is at least 30</li><li>navy size is at least 20</li> | <li>add navy tradition = 20</li><li>add sailors = 2000</li> | [Sponsor Naval Infrastructure](#caamas_sponsor_naval_infrastructure)<br />[Bolster Internal Trade](#caamas_bolster_internal_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_mare_sarmadfar">Farge Sarmadfar</a><br />*The Sarmadfar, the Summer-Sea, naturally should be the wealthiest of all Eordand. A warm climate with almost no snowfall, protected harbors against the waves, and easy access to foreign ports, the Sarmadfar is prime for the manifestation of trade. We must wrest control from our rivals so that the fruits of the sea and summer belong to us.* | <li>home trade node:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "caamas_sarmadfar_trade_dominance" for 50 years</li> | [Favor of the Merchant Lords](#caamas_curry_favor_from_merchant_lords)<br />[Merchant Holds](#caamas_merchant_holds)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_venture_further_south">Venture Further South</a><br />*The expedition into the Fograc lands has been enlightening but almost disappointing. Their lands are meagre and unimpressive, there surely must be more to the South. The lands south are blessed by the Summer, ever increasingly warmer and tropical. There are also Kheionai merchants who have ventured into the Sarmadfar from the south before. We must mount an expedition further south to discover what riches lie there.* | <li>colonial haraf:</li><ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "caamas_haraf_interests" for 20 years</li> | [Farge Sarmadfar](#caamas_mare_sarmadfar)<br />[Convert the Fograc](#caamas_convert_the_fograc)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_foothold_in_haraf">Foothold in Haraf</a><br />*To the south of the great desert lies a vast land blessed by the Summers light. Warm and plentiful, they seem like a paradise to the Caamasi. However, this land is not empty. The 'Harafe' lay claim to the more arid north, the Kooras in the savanna, and some curious mouthless peoples who watched our explorers from afar. Regardless of the strange inhabitants, this land has beckoned many Caamasi towards it, the land seemingly blessed by the Summer itself. Let us help them stake claim in these lands.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>colonial region is colonial_haraf</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "caamas_integrating_haraf" for 20 years</li> | [Venture Further South](#caamas_venture_further_south)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_urdea_samrad">Urdea Samrad</a><br />*The colonization of Haraf has been a success, with many Caamas settling in these warm lands honoring the Summer. A wide river and protected harbor, the perfect location for the keystone of our settlement in Haraf, has been found and chartered. It will be called Urdea-Samrad, the bastion of the Summer and staging point for all our future endeavours. A grand lighthouse tower shall be constructed, a guiding beacon towards our new land.* | <li>owns core province 2088</li> | <li>2088:</li><ul><li>change culture = caamas</li><li>change province name = "Urdea-Samrad"</li><li>rename capital = "Urdea-Samrad"</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "caamas_urdea_samrad"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Foothold in Haraf](#caamas_foothold_in_haraf)<br /> |

| <a name="caamas_bolster_internal_trade">Bolster Internal Trade</a><br />*The Summer Court is a constant pool of infighting between opportunistic merchants, wealthy lords, and humble priests who all prosper from and fight over one thing: trade. The sparkling blue waters of the Sarmadfar that the Summer Court holds sacred is the perfect mechanism for trade and profit: let us be certain that we have the upper hand by improving our markets.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any province in state:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 1</li><li>base production is at least 6</li></ul><li>any province in state:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 1</li></ul><li>base production is at least 6</li><li>base manpower is at least 4</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has capital scope has any province in state has province has center of trade of level is 1, and any province in state has base production is 6:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>If random province in state has province has center of trade of level is 1, and  has base production is 6:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "caamas_trade_secured"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>If random province in state does not have province has center of trade of level is 1; and  has base production is 6, and  has base manpower is 4:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "caamas_trade_secured"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="caamas_merchant_holds">Merchant Holds</a><br />*The Merchant Lords now listen to our word, impressed by our show of strength. They suggest a partnership with us over a common interest: holding a monopoly over the Sarmadfar trade. Although they have plentiful ships at their disposal, they lack one thing that we have in excess: land in which to develop their business beyond simple transportation of goods. * | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul></ul><li>faction influence:</li><ul><li>faction is mr_traders</li><li>influence is at least 60</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "caamas_merchant_hold" for 25 years</li> | [Bolster Internal Trade](#caamas_bolster_internal_trade)<br />[Favor of the Merchant Lords](#caamas_curry_favor_from_merchant_lords)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_floating_fortresses">Floating Fortresses</a><br />*With the influence and resources of the Merchant Lords at our disposal, it is time to think bigger and grander. Our small ships may exert our influence over the Sarmadfar and Elarbarc, but to achieve real dominance larger and more domineering ships should be built. Warships built like floating fortresses, bedecked with guns and clad in the strongest timbers, but also as maneuverable as the smallest dinghy, can be ours for a small fee.* | <li>num of heavy ship is at least 10</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "caamas_floating_fortresses" for 25 years</li> | [Merchant Holds](#caamas_merchant_holds)<br />[Farge Sarmadfar](#caamas_mare_sarmadfar)<br /> |

| <a name="caamas_fortify_bulwark_ruins">Fortify Bulwark Ruins</a><br />*The shorelines of the Summer Court are dotted with ancient Precursor ruins, weathered by the endless barrage of waves but still standing with a grandeur unmatched by any modern construction. Many of their foundations are still solid, sheltering areas of the coast from the sea. Let us extend their protection to not just the waves, but as a bulwark against any that would bring ruin to our lands.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If every core province has fort building trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Bolster Internal Trade](#caamas_bolster_internal_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_unite_summer_court">Unite Summer Court</a><br />*The Summer Court has long been divided among rival states: we are the ones who are worthy to rule them all. Murdkather, Dearktir, Bagcatir, Sidmargbal, all will be under our guardianship. For we stand highest in the Summer's sunlight, foremost of the greatest season. Together the children of the Summer can bring the radiating warmth of our season to all of Eordand.* | <li>owns core province 2022</li><li>owns core province  2028</li><li>owns core province   2041</li><li>owns core province    2037</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "caamas_summer_union" for 50 years</li><li>custom tooltip = EORDAND_unite_caamas_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If eordand superregion has culture is caamas, and does not have owned by is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Fortify Bulwark Ruins](#caamas_fortify_bulwark_ruins)<br /> |
| <a name="caamas_pretenders_of_pelomar">Pretenders of Pelomar</a><br />*To the south are the pathetic imposters, the so-called Champions of the Fey. For too long Pelomar has exploited its long defunct title, it is time that they are put down and replaced by those truly worthy.* | <li>owns core province 2049</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Pelomar</li></ul> | <li>If drisleak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If sidmargbal area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Demands of the Domandrod](../events/demands_of_the_domandrod.md) happens</li> | [Unite Summer Court](#caamas_unite_summer_court)<br /> |

| <a name="murdkather_elarbarc_tensions">Elarbarc Tensions</a><br />*Elarbarc, named after the famous mariner Ealar, is known for it bustling shipbuilding industry, trade, and floating festivals upon the water. However, this tranquility is more often broken than intact in recent years, for the pretentious lords of Dearktir have threatened our trade and people. Situated on the island of Billel, the Dearktirans harass our merchants with fines and tariffs entering and leaving Murdkather harbor, supposedly entering their sovereign waters. It is our duty to protect our citizens and their livelihoods: Dearktir's harassment will end with our seizure of the island!* | <li>2053:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2052:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>2053:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "murdkather_billel_elarbarc_toll"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="murdkather_autumn_passage">Autumn Passage</a><br />*North of Murdkather, past a short span of woods before the Domandrod, is a narrow passage of habitable lands bordering the Egasach claimed by the Trimgarb Peitar tribe. They threaten us and insult as heretics, claiming that they have a righteous quest to end our veneration of the Summer. Besides, their lands connect the Randrunnse to the Elarbarc and Sarmadfar. Let us both end their threats against our faith, livelihoods, and increase our profits from control of the trade!* | <li>2045:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>trimgarb area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>2045:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "murdkather_rebellious_peitar"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>trimgarb area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "murdkather_rebellious_peitar"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Elarbarc Tensions](#murdkather_elarbarc_tensions)<br /> |
| <a name="murdkather_summer_shipyards">Summer Shipyards</a><br />*Since the days of Ealar the Mariner, Murdkather has been a bustling center of shipbuilding. Fed by timber from the Domandrod borderlands of Snodglac and Galarig, our ships are highly prized throughout Eordand. In the late 15th and early 16th century efforts were made to improve and expand the shipbuilding industry by prioritizing prime timber logging and repairing ancient Precursor drydocks in Murdkather harbor.* | <li>2037:</li><ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2043:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2051:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2037:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "arakeprun_elarbarc_shipyards"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Autumn Passage](#murdkather_autumn_passage)<br /> |
| <a name="murdkather_randrunnse_ports">Randrunnse Ports</a><br />*Trade from all of Eordand makes its way to the Sarmadfar, but we should not ignore the sources of these many riches. The Randrunnse, a large sea not unlike the Sarmadfar but for its cold winters, is a nexus for trade for the Winter Court and the Autumn invaders in the north. With our access to the north secured by pacifying the Trimgarb, the Randrunnse trading cities of Jhorgashirr and Slegcal just within our reach. Murdkather must enlighten and enrich these frigid lands with the warmth of the Summer!* | <li>1965:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>1809:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "murdkather_randrunnse_ports1" for 30 years</li> | [Summer Shipyards](#murdkather_summer_shipyards)<br /> |
| <a name="murdkather_snecboth_fur_trade">Snecboth Fur Trade</a><br />*The ports of the Randrunnse are filled with timber, tar, fish, and most importantly, plentiful furs. Although there are some Precursor Relics to be found, the fur trade from the boundless forests of the north are far richer. However, they fur trappers seem to be somewhat... unambitious. The Snecboth must be taught proper mercantile practices, for their own benefit of course.* | <li>fur is at least 5</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is fur</li><li>base production is at least 3</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is fur</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If random owned province has trade goods is fur:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = murdkather_fur_trade</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is fur:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = murdkather_fur_trade</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is fur:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = murdkather_fur_trade</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [Randrunnse Ports](#murdkather_randrunnse_ports)<br /> |

| <a name="drisleak_hold_billel">Hold Billel</a><br />*For uncounted years the Dukad of Dearktir has held claim to the island of Billel, although it was deemed hardly worth it to administer the near-barren island. In 1432 Carodir Strongarm made efforts to populate and fortify the island, also implementing strict trade laws forcing merchants en route to Murdkather to pay fees. Murdkather understandably is threatened by this and seeks to end our hold over Billel and the trade fees: we must continue Carodir's efforts and erect a mighty fortress to protect our interests.* | <li>2053:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>2053:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_15th</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "drisleak_billel_fortifications"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="drisleak_eclipse_murdkather">Eclipse Murdkather</a><br />*Now that Billel is fortified and secured, our control over the Elarbarc has been strengthened. Murdkather remains the shining jewel of the Summer Court, with Dearktir in its shadow. We must endeavour to improve, develop, and beautify our city at least as an equal of Murdkather, if not grander. All will speak of Dearktir as the grandest port in all of Eordand!* | <li>2028:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>2028:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul> | [Hold Billel](#drisleak_hold_billel)<br /> |
| <a name="drisleak_curb_the_bagcatiran_lords">Curb Bagcatir Peddlers</a><br />*Bagcatir remains our only threat in the Sarmadfar trade. Run by free merchants, they defy our rightful claim over their lands. Bagcatir must be shown its place as a subject and have its merchant class thrown down once and for all!* | <li>2022:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>2022:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "drisleak_western_port"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Eclipse Murdkather](#drisleak_eclipse_murdkather)<br /> |

| <a name="bagcatir_city_of_free_merchants">City of Free Merchants</a><br />*Bagcatir is the sole republic in Eordand, run by the cooperation of powerful merchants allied together for the exclusive freedoms they enjoy. Founded in ages long shrouded, Bagcatir broke free from a polity that Dearktir claims its roots from, the ancient tyrant state Drisleak. Now they come to us again demanding servitude based on dusty ancient claims. If we are to remain free from Dearktir, Pelomar, or any other that threatens our city, we must uphold our republican virtues that have made our city strong, and trust in our Comhair to make true and strong decisions for us all.* | <li>republican tradition is at least 90</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 5</li><li>dip is at least 5</li><li>mil is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 50</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li> |  |
| <a name="bagcatir_capitalize_on_elarbarc_tensions">Tension among the Elarbarc</a><br />*The Elarbarc has been beset by close competition of the rival states Dearktir and Murdkather, often erupting into spiteful war. A thorn in the side of Murdkather, the island of Billel owned by Dearktir forces traders entering the port to pay entry fees. In this great competition we must remain wary and ready for any situation, for at any moment the scales might be in our favor. If this great game were to end, it would cement our future as a free city forevermore!* | <li>2053:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>2028:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2037:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If paskala area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dearktir area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If murdkather area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "bagcatir_elarbarc_supremacy" for 30 years</li> | [City of Free Merchants](#bagcatir_city_of_free_merchants)<br /> |
| <a name="bagcatir_control_the_south_sarmadfar">Control South Sarmadfar</a><br />*The south coast of the Sarmadfar is sparsely populated, with little reason to establish communities and control over the region. On the far eastern shores of the Elarbarc near the border of Murdkather a small colony has settled, sponsored by an eccentric coalition of merchants. They claim that the native Fograc people, long thought traitors to the Eordellon faith as a whole, are more welcoming and receptive of our colonies than was previously thought. Now that relative stability has been brought to the region, many Caamasi have thought to venturing into these lands, and possibly settling there. Let us lead this movement and secure an alliance with the native Fograc.* | <li>2056:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2055:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2054:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2061:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>2022:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "bagcatir_colonial_spirit" for 25 years</li> | [Tension among the Elarbarc](#bagcatir_capitalize_on_elarbarc_tensions)<br /> |
