| <a name="surakes_civil_registry">Expand the Administration</a><br />*With this nation encompassing so many people, we will need a more thorough form of administration to keep track of them all. Censuses must be taken, registries must be made and maintained, and we will need places to sort out issues of crime and punishment without needing to ship criminals to the capital for trial.\n\nOne of our advisors has proposed building new courtly administration complexes in every major human city in Bulwar, to ensure both a wide enough coverage within the system to avoid straining it and that all justice and administration takes place under watchful human eyes, loyal to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].* | <li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>surakes bulwari cities:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -150</li><li>surakes bulwari cities:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = surakes_registry_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Founding of Surakeš](#surakes_surakes_made)<br /> |

Thus far, we have been using the prominent dialect of our capital, but some feel that this excludes the other peoples of our nation.\n\nOne of our advisors has come to us with the outlines of a new language, a special dialect they call Standard Surakeši. They say that through use by the government and merchant classes we can make this into the nationwide standard, allowing anyone from any part of Surakeš to speak with anyone else.* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>prestige is at least 75</li><li>philosopher is at least 3</li><li>statesman is at least 3</li> | <li>country gets the modifier surakes_language_modifier until otherwise removed</li> | [The Golden Generation](#surakes_golden_generation)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_harpy_hills">Daughters of Firanya</a><br />*The harpies of the northern hills are one of the three major ‘monstrous’ races that live in our realm. They steal our men and take any shiny things they find, but they are also swift, have the obvious benefit of flight, and make excellent diplomats and messengers when they have a mind for it.\n\nWe must determine what is to be done with them so that our northern borders and peoples may know peace.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_harpies_owned_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture group is harpy</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_has_harpies_tooltip</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has harpy minority trigger yes</li><li>has harpy majority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_not_harpies_tooltip</li><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has harpy minority trigger yes</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has harpy majority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has has harpy minority trigger is yes, and has harpy majority trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>the event [Daughters of Firanya](../events/daughters_of_firanya.md) happens</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>add adm power = 200</li></ul> | [Surakeši Nationalism](#surakes_remains_surakesi)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_wall_stone">A Wall of Stone</a><br />*Our nation has few land routes into it: Two ways to Rahen, two to the Plains, two to the Salahad, one to the Deepwoods, one to old Dostanor, and two to the Dwarf-holds of the Segbandal.\n\nIt would be best if those who sought entrance by land to Surakeš, came up against great fortresses of stone. That way, they will think twice about trying anything, and will bring back tales of our incredible defenses to those who might seek to breach them.* | <li>surakes bulwari borders:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building fort_17th</li><li>has building  fort_18th</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>526:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 4 yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>surakes bulwari borders:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = surakes_stone_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Garden of Surakeš](#surakes_garden_surakes)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_wall_wood">A Wall of Wood</a><br />*The Divenhal presents a slightly more difficult egress into our lands. One could simply sail up to the coast and disembark anywhere they like if they weren’t allowed in the ports.\n\nThis can be solved with the construction of a grand navy, one that will make pirates and unwanted landers alike think twice before trying to sneak into our lands by sea or pillage our coasts.* | <li>num of galley is at least 60</li><li>num of heavy ship is at least 30</li> | <li>country gets the modifier surakes_armada_modifier for 25 years</li> | [A Wall of Stone](#surakes_wall_stone)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_wall_steel">A Wall of Steel</a><br />*The final line of defense of any nation are its armies. And ours must be even grander than our armada or fortresses combined. Let the foreigners see our sun dappled legions training and marching about in glorious formations, let their discipline strike fear into our potential foes and their glory inspire our citizens to greatness.* | <li>army size is at least 150</li> | <li>country gets the modifier surakes_sunforged_modifier for 25 years</li> | [A Wall of Wood](#surakes_wall_wood)<br /> |

| <a name="surakes_surakes_made">The Founding of Surakeš</a><br />*It is done.\n\nFor the first time since the God-Kings of ancient Bulwar, our people are united with no masters but themselves. This is a momentous occasion! All across Bulwar from the Maqeti in the east to the Bahari in the west, people are celebrating their newfound freedoms and the nation that gave it to them. But now that we are a unified country, we must decide where the government shall be situated. There are many ancient cities which would suit our needs.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 3</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_all_surani_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture is surani</li><li>not:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_all_zanite_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture is zanite</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_all_brasanni_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture is brasanni</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_all_bahari_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture is bahari</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_all_gelkar_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture is gelkar</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_all_sadnatu_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture is sadnatu</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [A Capital for Our Nation](../events/a_capital_for_our_nation.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="surakes_looking_cooper">Looking for Copper</a><br />*The Copper Dwarves of Ovdal Tûngr have been in Bahar for millennia and we have often had favourable dealings with them. Dwarven expertise in many fields is not to be scoffed at and would be a great boon to us if we had it at our disposal in the capital.\n\nLet us make a deal with them, their advisors in our capital in exchange for resources and supplies for their hold.* | <li>accepted culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>526:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has dwarven hold 3 yes</li></ul> | <li>526:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = surakes_hold_modifier</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [The Founding of Surakeš](#surakes_surakes_made)<br /> |

Sour after being ousted from their deified positions and palaces, they will need some convincing and a certain degree of pampering if we are to get their advisors helping in our court.* | <li>accepted culture is sun_elf</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>culture is sun_elf</li><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has culture is sun elf:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = surakes_elvencity_modifier</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Looking for Copper](#surakes_looking_cooper)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_anthem_surakes">An Anthem for Surakeš</a><br />*Every good state needs an anthem, to celebrate our glorious nation.

| <a name="surakes_remains_surakesi">Surakeši Nationalism</a><br />*If one were to look at a modern map of Bulwar, all they would see is Surakeš. If one were to go to Bulwar, however, one does not see the Surakeši, one sees Bahari, Brassani, Gelkars, Zanites, Surani, Copper Dwarves, and Sun Elves.\n\nThis is a problem. A state will only survive if its people believe in that state and what it represents. And for the state to represent them, they need to have one, cohesive, identity.

| <a name="surakes_whats_bulwari">What is a Bulwari?</a><br />*Now that we have determined what to do with the various ‘monstrous’ races that lay within our borders, it is time to address the broader question of what it means to be ‘Bulwari’.\n\nThe answer to this question will change how many in our nation perceive themselves, so we must be certain of the path we take.* | <li>adm power is at least 250</li> | <li>add adm power = -250</li><li>the event [What is a Bulwari?](../events/what_is_a_bulwari.md) happens</li> | [Daughters of Firanya](#surakes_harpy_hills)<br />[Deliver Us](#surakes_deliver_us)<br />[The Gnoll Question](#surakes_gnoll_question)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_garden_surakes">The Garden of Surakeš</a><br />*Long ago, the God-Kings of Bulwar were known to keep great gardens and tending to them was seen as a very civilized pastime. Tablets and steles from those times tell us how they saw gardens as a sanctuary from the chaos of the world, a demonstration of man’s ability to name nature and the world around him. They saw their kingdoms as gardens as well, a unified, organized, sanctuary within the chaos of the world, with the monarch as its gardener, tending to its needs and ensure its growth is unfettered, but also directed.\n\nWe have the funds and the control to do the same now. The whole of the Suran river valley could be made to have fine, expansive gardens with great walls surrounding them from the outside world like those of ancient Bulwar, irrigated by the river and tended by the local lords and peoples. The gardens themselves are already there, of course, they need only be expanded and walled off.* | <li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>treasury is at least 5000</li> | <li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>add treasury = -5000</li><li>the event [The Garden of Surakeš](../events/the_garden_of_surakes.md) happens</li> | [What is a Bulwari?](#surakes_whats_bulwari)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_flowers_river">Flowers in the Rivers</a><br />*The Gardens that can be found dotting all the cities and towns along the Suran river have given rise to a curious new tradition. The people who work the river have begun to lay flowers in it to float down the river to the Divenhal. This is seen as good luck, like tossing coins into a fountain.\n\nThe effect of hundreds of people doing this almost every day has been that the Suran river is constantly dotted with lovely flowers of all varieties. Some have said that it is as if the river itself were a garden.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_river_garden_tooltip</li><li>always</li></ul><li>surakes river provinces:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>the event [Gardens in the River](../events/gardens_in_the_river.md) happens</li> | [The Garden of Surakeš](#surakes_garden_surakes)<br /> |
| <a name="surakes_flowers_desert">Flowers in the Deserts</a><br />*The deserts of our eastern holdings are a beautiful place, if one knows where and how to look. The Harra Oasis is home to beautiful landscapes of trees and flowers that cannot be found elsewhere in the country. The eastern deserts are home to exotic cacti and other such hardy plants that are no less lovely when they bloom.\n\nWe should cultivate these lands and these plants so that there might be lush gardens even the most desolate and remote corners of our nation.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_desert_garden_tooltip</li><li>always</li></ul><li>surakes desert provinces:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 18</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>the event [Gardens in the Desert](../events/gardens_in_the_desert.md) happens</li> | [Flowers in the Rivers](#surakes_flowers_river)<br /> |

But if we can make gardens in the middle of Far Salahad, we can make gardens in the mountains of our home.\n\nThey will be complexes of gardens, monasteries, and retreats, so that any who make the long climbs to visit will be rewarded with peace, comfort, and a place to give praise to Surakel and his glory in the physically closest place one can get to the heavens.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is SURAKES_mountain_garden_tooltip</li><li>always</li></ul><li>surakes mountain provinces:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 18</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>the event [Gardens in the Mountain](../events/gardens_in_the_mountain.md) happens</li> | [Flowers in the Deserts](#surakes_flowers_desert)<br /> |

| <a name="surakes_nationalize_cult">Desacralize the Cult</a><br />*The Sun Cult has been worshipped in Bulwar since time immemorial in some form or other. All know that Surakel fights an endless battle against the Darkness and that one day, He will return to us and lead us to glory.\n\nHowever, there are many interpretations of this knowledge. The Jaddari believe that we all fight the battle with Surakel, us here on Halann, and Him in the heavens. The New Sun Cult believes that Jaher was Surakel reborn, and that his people, the Sun Elves, would lead us to that aforementioned glory. If we are to ensure that only one of these beliefs is adhered to, we will need more control over the faith, and that means removing its influence on the government.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Azka-Evran</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Birsartanses</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Irrliam</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Varamhar</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Sareyand</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Elizna</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>631:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>643:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>522:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>5434:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>religion is the_jadd</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Jaddari</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Jadd Empire</li></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = SURAKES_desacralize_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has religion group is bulwari:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = surakes_nationalized_modifier</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier surakes_nationalcult_modifier for 10 years</li> | [The Founding of Surakeš](#surakes_surakes_made)<br /> |

But we know that many of our current cities are built on the ruins of older ones and many places which we use now for one purpose, used to be used for another in times gone by.\n\nPerhaps, if we were to organize excavations at one of the more ancient sites such as Eduz-Vacyn or Bulwar, we might be able to find pieces of the past to learn from.

People hold celebrations and parties for anything they can think of, as a way to help banish the Darkness from their minds and spread joy amongst their friends and neighbours.\n\nOne of our advisors, a devout follower of Surakel, has proposed that we hold a state sponsored festival every year, of grand proportions, in honour of Surakel, on the solstices, the longest and shortest days of the year.* | <li>treasury is at least 2500</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>overextension percentage is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -2500</li><li>the event [The Solstice Festivals](../events/the_solstice_festivals.md) happens</li> | [We Need a Hero](#surakes_need_hero)<br /> |

But they are also strong and willful and good soldiers and in some places have been known to live side by side with their human neighbours in peace.

| <a name="surakes_golden_bazaar">A Golden Bazaar</a><br />*Brasan is one of the largest and oldest cities in Bulwar. It has ever been a city of merchants and trade and being situated at the mouth of Suran and Buranun rivers, the end of the Golden Highway, and at the end of the Divenhal coast, all trade will eventually flow into it.\n\nWith our new Golden Sea Lanes and the Golden Highway refurbished, people all over have begun to refer to its great central marketplace as the Golden Bazaar. And the merchants have certainly taken to that name quite quickly, most paying to have gold worked into their stalls or shop fronts or signs. They even pooled money for the city to rebrick the market plazas with great mosaic sun motifs inlaid with gold. It has become a singular sight to behold.* | <li>565:</li><ul><li>development is at least 50</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num free building slots is at least 1</li></ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>565:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = surakes_bazaar_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Golden Sea Lane](#surakes_golden_sea)<br /> |
