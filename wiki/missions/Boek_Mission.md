| <a name="G01_looking_to_the_future">Looking to the Future</a><br />*Our shamans have long been our window into the future. By conversing with the aspects of the world they are sometimes to gain glimpses into what is to come, allowing us to prepare.\n\nWith the recent calm at our border with the Cheshoni the time has come to look for answers again. Have we beaten them finally back or is this simply the calm before a large raid?* | <li>church power is at least 100</li> | <li>add church power = -100</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>add mil power = 100</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Future of Boek](../events/the_future_of_boek.md) happens</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="G01_search_for_a_path">Search for a Path</a><br />*Ever since the first portents of danger our shamans and scouts have been scouring both worlds, delving into ever darker parts. We cannot stop. Any help is welcome in averting us what is to come.* | <li>manpower is at least 15</li> | <li>add manpower = -5</li><li>country gets the modifier boek_exploration for 10 years</li><li>If has mission completed is G01 a prophecy fulfilled:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [A Search for a Path](../events/a_search_for_a_path.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [Looking to the Future](#G01_looking_to_the_future)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_prepare_a_feast">Prepare a Feast</a><br />*A dark pine forest, the light of the full moon shines through the branches, a large grey wolf emerges from between the trees.\n\nIn their scouring of the dream world one of the shamans has come across the wolf spirit. It is willing to help us in return for a favour. Knowing our desperation the shaman has agreed to the terms and the spirit has spoken.* | <li>1044:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 8</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>1044:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = boek_ground_hungers</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Prophecy Fulfilled](#G01_a_prophecy_fulfilled)<br />[Search for a Path](#G01_search_for_a_path)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_sating_the_hunger">Sating the Hunger</a><br />*First we need to pierce the veil between the waking and dreaming worlds. The shamans have come forward with a ritual to do so, but it will require many sacrifices. Our hearts bleed as we hear the description of what needs to be done, but what other way is there? Sometimes the herd needs to leave behind a few to ensure the survival of the rest.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has siege</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>controlled by is this nation</li><li>has siege</li><li>units in province is this nation</li></ul><li>unit is in battle</li></ul></ul> | <li>add church power = 50</li><li>1044:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = boek_sated_hunger</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [Prepare a Feast](#G01_prepare_a_feast)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_breaking_the_seal">Breaking the Seal</a><br />*The beat of drums & chanting fills the air, shamans dancing around a large oak, on its trunk the shape of a large door painted in blood.\n\nThe ritual to break through into the dreaming world is ready. Once prepared our strongest braves and mightiest shamans will enter into the other world and meet our guide there. But first we need to ensure that the path offered is safe. One of our braves has volunteered as a scout.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>1044:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is dobondotimveb</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Leviathan":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1500</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier boek_broken_seal for 10 years</li> | [Sating the Hunger](#G01_sating_the_hunger)<br /> |

| <a name="G01_a_prophecy_fulfilled">A Prophecy Fulfilled</a><br />* A wolf howl, a flash of crimson light, a figure stumbling away from the large oak.\n\nThe ritual has worked. Our scout has entered into the dreaming world and will meet with the wolf spirit there as promised. He was given a symbol of friendship by the spirit, a wolf catching its own tail, on the scouts flesh. This mark of friendship is to be tattooed on each of our chiefs from now on.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is year is at least 1600</li></ul></ul><li>trollsbay region:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>culture is not ruinborn is yes</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>is year is at least 1600</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier boek_prophecy_fulfilled for 25 years</li><li>If has mission completed is G01 search for a path:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [A Search for a Path](../events/a_search_for_a_path.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [Looking to the Future](#G01_looking_to_the_future)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_reject_fate">Reject Fate</a><br />*With the gate to the Dotimveb open and contact with the wolf spirit established, time for the final preparations has come. We will not accept the fate laid before us like some trapped hare. We will fight to the end. The Boek will not be forgotten, we will fight and if we die, it will be a death all other tribes will tell stories about until the end of days.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trollsbay region:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>culture is not ruinborn is yes</li></ul><li>is city</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is year is at least 1620</li></ul></ul></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture is not ruinborn is yes</li><li>war score against:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is -50</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>prestige is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If boek river area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If zanlib area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If trollsmaw swamp area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If umuhit area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Prophecy Fulfilled](#G01_a_prophecy_fulfilled)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_facing_the_end">Facing the End</a><br />*The time has come to face Fate itself. All preparations have been made. The gate has been set. The war party assembled. They will either do what is required of them or die trying. A last feast has been thrown in their honour. They are heroes of the tribe and will be sent off as such. All we can do now is hope. May their sacrifices ensure the survival of us all.* | <li>unlocked all tier 2 dotim aspects is yes</li><li>church power is at least 200</li> | <li>add church power = -200</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier boek_faced_the_end until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = dotim_unlock_end_of_all_things_tt</li><li>set country flag [dotim_unlocked_end_of_all_things](../flags/dotim_unlocked_end_of_all_things.md)</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Face of Death?](../events/the_face_of_death.md) happens</li></ul> | [Breaking the Seal](#G01_breaking_the_seal)<br />[The First Foray](#G01_the_first_foray)<br /> |

| <a name="G01_stabilize_the_federation">Stabilise the Federation</a><br />*Unlike the tribes surrounding us, we are not one, but 3 people. When working together this is a great advantage, the tribes working together in symbiosis. However recently, the different tribes of the federation are constantly at one another's throat, each with differing opinions on how to save our way of life. We need to work together if we are to survive.* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has native migration government yes</li></ul><li>native longhouse is at least 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>stability is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier boek_stabilized_the_federation for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G01_first_boek_king">First Boek King</a><br />*We are a young nation and have yet to finalise how our federation is to be run. Giving each tribe a voice would keep them content, but would make our government slow and cumbersome, a death sentence while we have to fight off the bloody raids of the Cheshoni. We need a chief that stands above the tribes and is able to mediate between them.* | <li>total development is at least 50</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is ADM</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is DIP</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is MIL</li></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = feudalism</li><li>value = 100</li></ul></ul> | [Stabilise the Federation](#G01_stabilize_the_federation)<br />[Warriors and Traders](#G01_warriors_and_traders)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_a_time_for_unity">A Time for Unity</a><br />*We have been selfish. We have only taken care of ourselves, not of our fellow tribes. They too, must surely stand to suffer as well once the prophecies have started fulfilling themselves. We need to warn our brothers and sisters and offer them a place by the warm fire. In winter the lone warrior dies, while the group that works together survives.* | <li>barracks is at least 5</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>government is native</li></ul> | <li>change government = monarchy</li><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>If coast of isobel area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If thilvis area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If laneksfield area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ikla area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = G41</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 120</li></ul> | [First Boek King](#G01_first_boek_king)<br />[A Prophecy Fulfilled](#G01_a_prophecy_fulfilled)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_mocking_death">Mocking Death</a><br />*Long ago our people were given a prophecy, said to come from deah itself, that Boek would fall. Now Boek stands strong, and many of foes lie dead at our feats. None will oppose the Kingdom of the Boek. But one foe still remains - we must defeat death itself.* | <li>coast of isobel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>thilvis area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>boek river area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>zanlib area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>trollsmaw swamp area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>umuhit area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>spoorland area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>okhiboli area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>greywood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>valorpoint area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>laneksfield area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>ikla area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [boek_upgraded_ideas](../flags/boek_upgraded_ideas.md)</li><li>swap free idea group = yes</li> | [Reject Fate](#G01_reject_fate)<br />[A Time for Unity](#G01_a_time_for_unity)<br />[Defender of the Boek](#G01_defender_of_the_boek)<br /> |
| <a name="G01_the_first_foray">The First Foray</a><br />*Ash raining from the sky, ruins covered in moss, a flash of light.\n\nOur shamans have brought new tidings once again. The Aspects indicate that the ruins of the Old Ones hold secrets that will help save us. Long we have avoided the broken stone houses, but in the harsh winter the wolf will also hunt the largest elk. If they offer something that may save us, we must take the opportunity.* | <li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 10</li></ul><li>religion is dotimism</li></ul><li>church power is at least 50</li> | <li>add church power = -50</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>increase ruler dip effect = yes</li><li>If random subject country has liberty desire is 0, and  has religion is dotimism:</li><ul><li>kill ruler = yes</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Price to Pay](../events/the_price_to_pay.md) happens</li></ul> | [Mocking Death](#G01_mocking_death)<br />[Sating the Hunger](#G01_sating_the_hunger)<br /> |

| <a name="G01_warriors_and_traders">Warriors and Traders</a><br />*While the 3 tribes of the federations act as one, that does not mean that each tribe fulfils every duty. We all have our different tasks and specialties, just like different ants in a colony. While the Kaparn venture out to trade with other tribes, the Lenef stay behind as eagle eyed guardians of our land. These differences in duties and outlook has caused friction between the 2 tribes in the past. This foolish bickering cannot be allowed to continue. We are all adults, not young braves squabbling over a hunted deer.* | <li>army size is at least 5</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has native migration government yes</li></ul><li>native storehouse is at least 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>workshop is at least 1</li><li>counting house is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>If spoorland area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If okhiboli area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If greywood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If valorpoint area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="G01_defender_of_the_boek">Defender of the Boek</a><br />*Our braves have long acted as the shield of the boek. First against Cheshoshi raiders and now against the invaders from across the sea. Nobody fights with as much bravery as the Boek. As long as our hearts and arms remain strong, we will protect our people. Now and forever.* | <li>trollsbay region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>culture is cheshoshi</li></ul><li>hidden trigger:</li><ul><li>tribal owner:</li><ul><li>culture is cheshoshi</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier boek_defender_of_the_tribes for 50 years</li> | [Warriors and Traders](#G01_warriors_and_traders)<br /> |
