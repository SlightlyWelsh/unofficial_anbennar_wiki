| <a name="U15_reinvent_the_boat">Reinvent the Boat</a><br />*To think our fellow tribes have discovered a means of transporting themselves over bodies of water before we even considered such a thing is nearly absurd, but it is the truth.

| <a name="U15_what_we_razed">What We Once Razed</a><br />*During war and conquest one must consider a few things; \n\nWhat can you reasonably kill? What can you reasonably take? What can you reasonably keep? \n\nOur warbosses and clansmen were wise in their conquests, and it is with their wisdom they had considered many of the constructions of the foolish elves and humans to be useless, ought to be used for greater, more useful constructions like... catapults and... battering rams. However, we may have been overzealous in our razing and burnings, as now we have to build what we once destroyed... from scratch.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is magairous_area</li><li>area  is aqatbahar_area</li><li>area   is fajabahar_area</li></ul><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>If every owned province has area is magairous area, and has area is aqatbahar area, and has area is fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>If has 533 has owned by is U15:</li><ul><li>533:</li><ul><li>add goblin minority size effect = yes</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul></ul> | [Reinvent the Boat](#U15_reinvent_the_boat)<br />[Finishing the Job](#U15_finishing_the_job)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_two_cities">The Sunset Cities</a><br />*Regardless of whether it be the best of times, or the worst of times, our kin had found it difficult to resist the pull of Re'uyel and Crathánor, and we obliged their whims and moved them to these cities on mass, both to civilize them and bring them further into our fold. In this epoch of our enlightenment--perhaps darkness for our foes--these two cities serve as beacons brighter than all the rest, jewels for all to see, and to believe the truth of our burgeoning empire once seen with doubt and incredulity. * | <li>521:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>516:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>accepted culture is bahari</li><li>accepted culture  is crathanori</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of rebel controlled provinces is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>521:</li><ul><li>add goblin minority size effect = yes</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>516:</li><ul><li>add goblin minority size effect = yes</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>change government reform progress = 50</li> | [Sharks On Our Shores](#U15_landshark)<br />[What We Once Razed](#U15_what_we_razed)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_elves">Pacify the Elves</a><br />*The elves were occupiers of this land, when we berid of them we were doing the land a favour, but not the elves. The fertile lands they once inhabited are ours first and foremost, and we have delegated the occupiers the scraps they once left to the humans and monsters that were unfortunate enough to live under their rule. However, it seems they are not taking to their new lands well, some even agitating for rebellion. While we are certainly not the kind to rescind what we have earned, we are also not in the market to eradicate an entire race... they are far more useful alive.\n\nWhile we may not be seen as benevolent rulers for at least a few generations, we can at least grant them the assurance they can practice their faith freely under our rule.* | <li>accepted culture is sun_elf</li><li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is sun_elf</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is sun_elf</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>medium tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li></ul> | <li>decrease monstrous 3 = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier "marblehead_elven_advisors" until otherwise removed</li> |  |

| <a name="U15_finishing_the_job">Finishing the Job</a><br />*It was they who declared on us, they who crashed upon us at Volnimestin--a peaceful settlement built by goblin hands--with their pathetic and jealous 'armies,' and what for? A broken country, and their lands overrun by those they sought to conquer. It is a pitiful sight to behold, peoples led to suffering in such a delusional state to think that their defeat was merely a fluke. No matter, it is time to show them how one properly conquers a country.* | <li>num of admirals is at least 1</li><li>U19:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If magairous area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If fajabahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>542:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="U15_dartax_is_cringe">The Traitor King</a><br />*The clanboss Dartax rose in arms to defend his people--followers of a religion near-indistinguishable to that of those we conquered during our exodus. It was our actions that brought about his rule; it was our numbers that fell upon the walls that diverted the attention of the armies of our mutual enemy away from his petty revolt, our spears and blades that killed the army that would have crushed him, and our might that broke the soldiers of Baharkand of their resolve. Had we not conquered, he and his human ilk would have been powderized. It is time we weaken his rule, and to bring the hearts of his followers away from him and his lofty ideals to our enlightened fold.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F22:</li><ul><li>exists</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 35</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>F22:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>religion is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If bahar szel uak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>651:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>657:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>658:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has F22 has exists:</li><ul><li>the event [Breaking Dartaxes' Authority](../events/breaking_dartaxes_authority.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = F22</li><li>value = -35</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>the event [Of Shamans and Cultists](../events/of_shamans_and_cultists.md) happens</li></ul> | [Finishing the Job](#U15_finishing_the_job)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_landshark">Sharks On Our Shores</a><br />*The Landshark are a particularly boorish and wild peoples, among our kind during the exodus that brought us here, yet unwilling to calm their barbaric ways and serve something greater and far more ambitious than the wild raiding operations they've always known. No, instead of taking up our offer to peacefully join our united goblin state, they chose to storm off to the shorelines and perpetuate the backwards ways of our ancestors, content to gnaw hungrily at other shoreline settlements and other ships with their boats and rafts, intent to snap up anything in their jaws and consume them for all their worth.\n\nTheir jagged nature is bound to have them butt heads with a foe too tough for even their teeth to cut through, their strength and fury bound to simple chaos without the guiding hand of a good and tactful master. With us at the helm of their boats and guiding their teeth to appropriate targets, our navies we will be unstoppable.* | <li>U11:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is marblehead_own_tribe_cores_tt</li><li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>is core is Landshark Clan</li></ul></ul><li>navy size is at least 25</li> | <li>change dip = 1</li><li>country gets the modifier "naval_enthusiasm_mission" for 25 years</li><li>If reuyel area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If crathanor area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = marblehead_inherit_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has U11 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>inherit = U11</li></ul></ul> | [The Grand Capital](#U15_grand_capital)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_elven_design">Study Elven Designs</a><br />*Our kin are a proud and ingenious race, if one were to ask anyone who to go to for something destroyed they would likely point to one of our kin with little exception. However, we are not particularly good at building things that last longer than an explosion, and though it has been an enlightening experience for our craftsmen and thinkers to build structures, houses, and things of the kind, we still have not mastered the ability to make a boat bigger than a longboat that doesn't immediately collapse in on itself. Luckily what we have now is more than a state, but an empire, an empire with access to more than just goblins unfamiliar with the sea. The elves, though of inferior mind, have a particular knack for building ships, one of them fabled to have sailed for a thousand years.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is semi_or_non_monstrous_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [semi_monstrous](../flags/semi_monstrous.md)</li><li>has country flag  no_longer_monstrous</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier monstrous_nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>medium tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is sun_elf</li><li>has elven minority trigger yes</li></ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>small increase of elven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>add dip tech = 1</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = naval_reformer</li><li>name = "Radin szel-Aqatbar"</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = sun_elf</li><li>religion = bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [Sharks On Our Shores](#U15_landshark)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_dwarves">Same Old Neighbours</a><br />*There has been no time in our history where such a thing like this has happened, where we have taken control of a hold populated by dwarves and have not immediately defaulted to kicking them out. While it would be doubtless much easier (and infinitely more entertaining) to kick the longbeards out, the promise of our society extends to all people of Bahar, and that includes extending an olive branch to what was once our worst enemies.\n\nIt is a hard task to work with them, which is why--for at least a few generations--we will let them rule themselves nominally under dwarves who've more loyalty to coin and greed than their own kind.* | <li>526:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>local autonomy is at least 50</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li></ul> | <li>decrease monstrous 3 = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier "marblehead_dwarven_advisors" until otherwise removed</li> |  |

| <a name="U15_proclamation">Proclamation Of Aqatbar</a><br />*The legacy of our great clan is one saddled at the back of our great founders; the two brothers of yore, whose visages stand tall in the square of Aqatbar, chiseled with the finest of marble, carted from the furthest reaches of our empire. The splendour of our capital and the brilliance of our empire would have made them proud, yet our leader knows they would not have stopped if they had the chance to merely unite the kin of Marblehead, no, they would have wished all goblins in Bahar and beyond these sands to be under our fold, united under a single banner stretched across all the lands.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>stability is at least 1</li></ul><li>536:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is year is at least 1464</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>U19:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>F34:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Proclamation](../events/the_proclamation.md) happens</li><li>U11:</li><ul><li>the event [The Proclamation](../events/the_proclamation.md) happens</li></ul><li>U14:</li><ul><li>the event [The Proclamation](../events/the_proclamation.md) happens</li></ul><li>U13:</li><ul><li>the event [The Proclamation](../events/the_proclamation.md) happens</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="U15_grand_capital">The Grand Capital</a><br />*To call Aqatbar the crown jewel of our empire is but a gross and disturbing misunderstanding of what our society is and how it is run. Aqatbar is not part of the empire, it IS the empire. Within its walls and plazas millions of souls dwell, goblins perched upon the rafters of marble and sandstone while other races wander about the streets engaging in open and public displays of their cultures. Humans and elves hold hands and sing songs while goblins and dwarves play instruments beneath the statues of our great founders, their eyes watching it all unfold. The city shines with the splendour of those we conquer, shining brighter with every new project and construction, the jewels of our conquests and the people they bring, and the harmony and prosperity brought with their labours and cooperation beneath the watchful eyes of our kin. \n\nAqatbar is not just a city, but a blueprint, a microcosm of what our empire will bring to all the land; unity, order, splendour, and glory within our enlightened grasp.* | <li>536:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>534:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li></ul><li>537:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li></ul><li>536:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>change culture = exodus_goblin</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "marblehead_grand_capital" for 25 years</li><li>change government reform progress = 50</li> | [Proclamation Of Aqatbar](#U15_proclamation)<br />[Finishing the Job](#U15_finishing_the_job)<br />[The Bastard Realm](#U15_azka_evran)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_mountainhugger">Surrounded By Mountains</a><br />*The Mountainhugger clan was once a noble and righteous clan, equal to us in stance and stature, brothers in arms when we crashed upon Bahar for the first time trying to escape the orcish yoke. They charged alongside us as we trampled the forts of Baharkand, sliced elves in twain along with their human thralls, and face their superior firepower with nothing but numbers and our relentless determination. What is left of them now however is a shade of what the once were, the noble clan had rejected our promise to keep them safe in our fold a long time ago, and now look what has become of them; savages following the paths of the mountainside, left unable to grow their own food and forced to crash themselves upon the bastions of other civilisations, using their once iron-hard resolve to focus on the destruction of walls and forts with unending waves of bodies and battering rams. \n\nIt's time to bring our degenerated brothers back to their senses, to remind them of who they once were and use their relentless and dogged determination to crush our enemies, united under our flag as we had long ago in our exodus!* | <li>num of artillery is at least 7</li><li>U14:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is marblehead_own_tribe_cores_tt</li><li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>is core is Mountainhugger Clan</li></ul></ul> | <li>change mil = 1</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = fortification_expert</li><li>name = "Syz As"</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = exodus_goblin</li><li>religion = goblinic_shamanism</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>If tungr mountains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = marblehead_inherit_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has U14 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>inherit = U14</li></ul></ul> | [The Grand Capital](#U15_grand_capital)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_sea_dwarves">From Marble To Copper</a><br />*We were at one point dwellers of a city of marble, a stone known for its inherent beauty and natural lustre, instilling a sense of purity and order just from a look alone. Marble, however, is not representative of strength. Marble cracks despite its sheen, marble does not bend, marble is seen by some as a sign of our decadence. The smiths at Ovdal Tûngr... dwarves, are professionals at dealing in copper, another less glamorous material though one much stronger than marble. Copper bends, copper does not break easily as a helmet, and combining new constructions with the conquest of our greatest enemies we can prove both our strength and our capability to change with the times.* | <li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>2942:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is not city</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>526:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul><li>2942:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is not city</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>527:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li><li>remove dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>525:</li><ul><li>change culture = exodus_goblin</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li><li>remove dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>526:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = marblehead_copper_autonomy</li><li>duration = 12775</li></ul></ul> | [Surrounded By Mountains](#U15_mountainhugger)<br /> |

| <a name="U15_azka_evran">The Bastard Realm</a><br />*Azka-Evran is a kingdom borne of resistance and martial prowess, once a fort of the realm of Baharkand, it grew in size and power over time as precious resources were found near it and formally became a proper power when we crashed upon Baharkand's smouldering corpse. These people of the fort were ruled by a bastard king, an intriguing fact but one that ultimately matters not when considering their other qualities. The warriors of this fort-made realm are a breed wholly unto themselves, a society of warriors ruling a state more than anything. If we were to conquer this fort and grant these warriors the respect they deserve, we could gain access to Bahar's best and brightest warriors to bolster our iron, but guiding, hand.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F34:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>is rival is Azka-Evran</li></ul><li>num of generals is at least 1</li> | <li>540:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>539:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>538:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |

If within your hearts you believe you are still ruled by Baharkand then you are right to believe so, if you believed in your heart that Baharkand would exist for centuries more then you are right as well! For the land we rule is still in the hands of the Bahari peoples, whether it be ruled by goblin might or elven treachery, this land is still the same one that exists in your beating heart and your precious memories, and will be for now until the end of time!

| <a name="U15_greysheep">Herding the Sheep</a><br />*The Greysheep were our fellow brothers in arms during the exodus, unlike our other brothers they primarily fought with their cunning, commandeering rams and devising ingenious solutions to issues of management and technology during the exodus, obtaining us necessary food sources to fund our expeditions southwards from the mountains. They had refused our call to unite as a greater whole and found their tactics and ideas failing against our common foe as they lacked the numbers and raw power of our combined forces. What remains of them now are poor sheep-and-ram ranchers, seemingly content to stew in mediocrity while using their cunning and brilliant minds to sew and knit things, trading their beautiful creations for a fraction of what they're truly worth at foreign markets. \n\nNo self-respecting goblin peoples should live like this, with their weakness spelled clearly out for all to see, their subjugation is inevitable. We must bring them back into our fold before another, less kind empire inevitably comes knocking at their door looking for free fashion advice.* | <li>U13:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is marblehead_own_tribe_cores_tt</li><li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>is core is Greysheep Clan</li></ul></ul><li>536:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>change adm = 1</li><li>add yearly manpower = 0.5</li><li>If harpylen area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If kuzak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = marblehead_inherit_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has U13 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>inherit = U13</li></ul></ul> | [The Grand Capital](#U15_grand_capital)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_forests">Bahari Timber</a><br />*Though our invasion of Bahar was likely one of the greatest things to have happened to the region, one notable exception of our just invasion was the travesty that befell the sturdy wooded forests between our initial holdings and our targets all along the cities of Baharkand. Their destruction helped fuel our just and righteous war machine, but also left the fields they once inhabited barren and notably wood-less for our current purposes. Since we have already given back to the people of Bahar so much, it is time to extend that kindness to the land we now inhabit.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is semi_or_non_monstrous_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [semi_monstrous](../flags/semi_monstrous.md)</li><li>has country flag  no_longer_monstrous</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier monstrous_nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain forest</li><li>has terrain  woods</li></ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>decrease monstrous 2 = yes</li><li>custom tooltip = marblehead_timber_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has terrain is forest, and has terrain is woods:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = marblehead_timber_time</li><li>duration = 12775</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Herding the Sheep](#U15_greysheep)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_humans">Convince the Humans</a><br />*The men of Baharkand were ruled for millenia by foreign rulers and have almost never seen a period of respite where they can call themselves rulers of their own souls. Instead, the iron grip of a foreign power, whether it be of the djinn, gnolls, or elves, is all they have known. It is truly pitiful, and is likely something they are used to but not appreciative of. Luckily, we are nothing like those old conquerors, and we have something that humans have been craving for for millenia; Autonomy, the sweet, sweet sense of self-governance they may get a taste of if they simply fold to our rule. They will never get to actually rule themselves of course, but for a time they can make the decisions for themselves, while we provide the pressures that will make following what we want the best course of action.* | <li>accepted culture is bahari</li><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is bahari</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>high tolerance human race trigger is yes</li> | <li>decrease monstrous 3 = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier "marblehead_human_advisors" until otherwise removed</li> |  |

| <a name="U15_the_marbleheads">Deploy the Marbleheads</a><br />*We were once dubbed 'Marbleheads' by the elves of Baharkand. They laughed as we wore the heads of great heroes and figures of the past as they rained their arrows upon us, we laughed in turn however when their joyous faces melted into fear, their arrows bouncing uselessly off of our makeshift armour as we descended upon them in unimaginable numbers. Today we wear that namesake like a badge of pride, the term personifying our cunning and strength allowing us a victory that would decide the history of this land and our empire forever. In honour of this past, the most elite legions of our nation are are known as Marblehead divisions, often marching with enchanted helmets, painted white and melded to resemble etched marble.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 1</li><li>mil tech is at least 3</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>has mil advisor yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "marblehead_squared" for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="U15_our_own_coin">Our Own Coin</a><br />*For much of our history we were used to relying on a simple bartering system to obtain the things we wanted. Much of that history, of course, was lived as clans in the wretched caves of the Serpentspine, where our ambitions were as vast as the head of a pin, content to merely subsist off of mushrooms and cave fish. Now that we have taken over something far more complicated, we've had to change and adapt quickly. For our purposes we adopted coinage, utilising what was available and simply taking foreign coins for convenience, but as our power grows the chokehold of elven influence in our new lands is still strong, not helped by our reliance on--mostly--their coinage.\n\nNo matter, by confiscating the coins of the empire's denizens and smelting them down we can issue a coin all our own, with the visage of our ruler plastered on it to remind the people who really is in charge.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type master_of_mint</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0</li><li>inflation is at least 0</li></ul></ul><li>538:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>538:</li><ul><li>add goblin minority size effect = yes</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = marblehead_coin</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Deploy the Marbleheads](#U15_the_marbleheads)<br />[The Bastard Realm](#U15_azka_evran)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_harpylen">No Matriarchs In My Hills</a><br />*Bahar only has enough space for one great empire, and that is ours. The matriarchal clans of the hills may have had their day in the sun, but their day has set long ago. With the inherently inferior management skills and wild, untamed nature, it is a miracle that a state solely ruled by them has lasted this long. Though they have ruled admirably, it is time we end this charade of allowing them to botch the management of their own lands and show them how a proper race runs a state.* | <li>660:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>is not female</li> | <li>the event [Harpy Marriage](../events/harpy_marriage.md) happens</li> | [Herding the Sheep](#U15_greysheep)<br />[Our Own Coin](#U15_our_own_coin)<br /> |
| <a name="U15_harpies">Feathered Advisors</a><br />*Having berid of the harpies from their lands, it's time we put their various natural talents to use where they are actually effective. Their fair features and dangerous beauty lend themselves well for drawing the eye of who they are speaking to, and their ability to fly allows them to reach long distances in the fraction of the time it takes a traditional cart to get somewhere. These talents combine make for great diplomats ready to arrive where they are needed when they are needed, as well as provide various... alternative methods of negotiation when need be.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>accepted culture is firanyan_harpy</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>culture is firanyan_harpy</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>medium increase of harpy tolerance effect = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier "marblehead_harpy_advisors" until otherwise removed</li> |  |
