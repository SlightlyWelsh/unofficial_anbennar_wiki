| <a name="pomentere_estates">Pomentere Estates</a><br />*We have long employed various warriors, adventurers, and fortune seekers in our armies as Pomentere, to supplement our trueborn Ynnic sons. Now that the Veykodan Guard is the core of our army, we need to ensure that we can always have a good stock of Veykodan warriors to recruit. We will grant veterans of our wars estates in the new lands we reconquer, where they can prosper within Ynnic society.* | <li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is G35WarsWon</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul><li>1141:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2810:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [has_pomentere_estates](../flags/has_pomentere_estates.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = ynn_pomentere_estates_info_tt</li><li>If is controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add accepted culture = veykodan</li></ul><li>1141:</li><ul><li>change culture = veykodan</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ynn_pomentere_estates</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2810:</li><ul><li>change culture = veykodan</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ynn_pomentere_estates</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_veykodan_rune_warriors for 10 years</li> | [Veykodan Rune Warriors](#veykodan_rune_warriors)<br /> |
| <a name="buycev_policy">Buycev Policy</a><br />*Our policy of employing Veykodan Buycev, while largely successful in allowing us to rein in the petty lords who have claimed to rule our lands, has seen Veykodan power grow substantially, and should we not control and reward them adequately, we run the risk of losing all our gains. By ensuring constant victories in which we can hand out the spoils of wealth, we can make sure they don’t turn against us.* | <li>num of cities is at least 5</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 1139</li><li>province id  is at least 1140</li><li>has province modifier ynn_pomentere_estates</li></ul></ul><li>num of subjects is at least 5</li><li>any hired mercenary company:</li><ul><li>template is veykodan_guard_merc</li><li>hired for months is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>If does not have province id is 1139, and does not have province id is 1140, and does not have province modifier is ynn pomentere estates:</li><ul><li>If every owned province does not have province id is 1139, and does not have province id is 1140:</li><ul><li>change culture = veykodan</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ynn_pomentere_estates</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>the event [Path of the Veykoda](../events/path_of_the_veykoda.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>U24:</li><ul><li>the event [Reclaiming the East](../events/reclaiming_the_east.md) happens</li></ul><li>the event [Expedition into the Moon Field](../events/expedition_into_the_moon_field.md) happens</li></ul> | [Pomentere Estates](#pomentere_estates)<br /> |
| <a name="veykodan_guard">Veykodan Guard</a><br />*So far, our recruits have been made up of strong, individual warriors seeking to make a name for themselves by fighting for the righteous Ynnic emperors. However, our recent successes have left us with vast lands no longer controlled by petty lords. We will hand these out to Veykodan veterans and families, encourage them to adopt our faith and create families to ensure that the next generations of emperor have a loyal and capable Veykodan Guard.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>1139:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>culture is veykodan</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>If random hired mercenary company has template is veykodan guard merc:</li><ul><li>add company manpower = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_veykodan_rune_armour until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = veykodan_rune_armour_tt</li> | [Buycev Policy](#buycev_policy)<br /> |
| <a name="thromshana_rangers">Thromshana Rangers</a><br />*The Tromseloc Way has been cleared of threats and slowly the number of outposts and forts has grown, some even turning into villages who make a living from servicing the ever increasing number of travellers and merchants.\n\nHowever, there are still reports of raids, of slaughtered remains along the way, no doubt the work of the last few straggling wendigos. Knights have for centuries formed the solution to beastly problems along the Ynn, but lest their power grow even more, let us turn instead to an even older tradition: rangers, patrolling the land for any signs of trouble, ready to hunt down even the scariest beasts.\n\nThe Tromseloc Way will receive a formal and organised force of rangers, based in nearby Thromshana. The Thromshana Rangers will make use of the finest steeds of the Thromshana ranch, a specialised smaller breed excellent for the roughlands the Tromseloc Way winds through.* | <li>1140:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tromsolec_way_rebuilt_tt</li><li>owns core province 2781</li></ul><li>mil tech is at least 9</li> | <li>1140:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = G35_tromseloc_way</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2781:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = G35_tromseloc_way</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_thromshana_rangers for 20 years</li> | [Veykodan Guard](#veykodan_guard)<br /> |
| <a name="along_the_tromseloc_way">Along the Tromseloc Way</a><br />*Now that the Tromseloc Way has been reopened, we have the opportunity to strike Dolindha from the east of the Ynn river, and reclaim the Throm Bacar, the Great Ynnic Dam of the east, where the floating town of Bosancovac has sprung as a haven from the mainland. Seizing it will not be easy, but we have the element of surprise on our side.\n\nOnce this vital crossing is secured, all of Dolindha will be within reach of reclamation, and not even the Bridge Wardens can stop us from doing so!* | <li>bosancovac area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>1165:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 15</li></ul> | [Thromshana Rangers](#thromshana_rangers)<br /> |
| <a name="the_blood_of_lukaus">Rescue the Old Capital</a><br />*The Dolindhans were the first to unite the Ynnics into one empire, and it was Vareynn who first united the Dolindhans. Now, Vareynn stands as a testament to the tragedy of the dark ages.\n\nReduced to a mere town, it is not even the true capital of its own state: that honour goes to the castle of Vareynn Amac in its countryside, while the imperial capital with its wide streets and its arched pathways and its half-finished hippodrome is left to decay when not outright pillaged for stone. We did what Vareynn’s petty lords could not, and now it is time to incorporate the original capital of the empire back into our realm.* | <li>trojvare area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>brelar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If has dlc is "El Dorado", and  is primitives:</li><ul><li>add authority = 10</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add legitimacy = 10</li><li>add devotion = 10</li><li>add republican tradition = 5</li></ul><li>If does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>1171:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 15</li></ul> | [Along the Tromseloc Way](#along_the_tromseloc_way)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwark_of_the_east">Bulwark of the East</a><br />*Amacimst has stood as a bulwark against the Cursed Ones even since the invasion of 1154, and while we commend their efforts to protect the the Ynn from those that would threaten it, these adventurers turned knights have no business running a realm of their own, and should once again serve the Empire.* | <li>G26:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul><li>amacimst area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>1172:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2742:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>1172:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = G35_bulwarks_of_the_east</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2742:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = G35_bulwarks_of_the_east</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change province name = "Vyrhrada"</li></ul> | [Rescue the Old Capital](#the_blood_of_lukaus)<br /> |

| <a name="veykodan_rune_warriors">Veykodan Rune Warriors</a><br />*Our recent defeat dealt by the petty lord Alaran has highlighted the flaws in our army, and there are many. Our forces, once strong enough to defend the entire empire, now are barely able to man the walls of Arverynn and are more of a militia than a true army. The loss of the keep of Arvezl leaves few Ynnic knights under our command, the Thromshana Ranch alone being not nearly enough to raise a strong core to rebuild our army with.\n\nCarodin II has instead proposed a radical alternative, an army based around the Veykodans of the east. Their rune magic makes them formidable adversaries, and their exotic sabretooth and woolly rhino mounts are almost able to compete with the mighty antler horses. While we have always employed small bands of Veykodans here and there, it is time to make them a true part of our army.* | <li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add mil power = -50</li><li>add treasury = -50</li><li>set country flag [G35_veykodan_mercs_available_flag](../flags/g35_veykodan_mercs_available_flag.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = G35_veykodan_guard_get_tt</li><li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_veykodan_rune_warriors for 5 years</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_veykodan_rune_warriors for 15 years</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_veykodans_flock_to_teal_banners for 1 years</li><li>custom tooltip = G35_dont_lose_veykodans_tt</li> |  |
| <a name="seize_the_imperial_palace">Seize the Imperial Palace</a><br />*In 674 emperor Darastarad I moved the imperial court to Stanyrhrada due to his love for the weather and countryside, where it stayed as the capital for two centuries. Its palace, once a beacon of our imperial might, has since been refitted into a castle which is the base of power of the yen Stantir, a cadet branch of the imperial dynasty.\n\nWhile we now rule from Arverynn and have no desire to move our court, they do not have the prestige of the Vyrekynn, and, should Stanyrhrada’s feudatories grow over-ambitious, their home would make a fantastic summer palace.* | <li>hradapolere area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>G86:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>G86:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "El Dorado"</li><li>is primitives</li></ul><li>authority is at least 10</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>legitimacy equivalent is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier G35_arverynn_resurgent for 10 years</li><li>If has G86 has exists:</li><ul><li>G86:</li><ul><li>If has ruler is "Tranvit III":</li><ul><li>set heir = hrenvyr_yen_stantir</li><li>set heir flag [G35_stanyrhrada_ward_flag](../flags/g35_stanyrhrada_ward_flag.md)</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set heir = hrenvyr_yen_stantir</li><li>set heir flag [G35_stanyrhrada_ward_flag](../flags/g35_stanyrhrada_ward_flag.md)</li><li>kill ruler = yes</li></ul><li>the event [Hrenvyr Ascends to the Lordship of Stanyrhrada](../events/hrenvyr_ascends_to_the_lordship_of_stanyrhrada.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>If has dlc is "El Dorado", and  is primitives:</li><ul><li>add authority = -10</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add legitimacy = -10</li><li>add devotion = -10</li><li>add republican tradition = -10</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = G35_stanyrhrada_ward_tt</li></ul> | [Defeat the Rebellion](#defeat_the_rebellion)<br /> |
| <a name="guard_the_veykodan_approach">The Veykodan Approach</a><br />*While many Veykodans travel west to seek employment under Ynnic lords, many more head west in warbands to loot and pillage our prosperous and well tended lands, showing the savage mindset that those far from the Ynn have.\n\nRaids from this region date all the way back to the times of Calrodiy the Great, who built Arverynn and Fadhevych as fortifications near the sites of his two biggest victories against Veykodan chieftains. While the first evolved into a city and the second into a castle, both keep acting as primary fortifications from which the approaches into Sarda are guarded; we should ensure that they are well kept and manned by fine soldiers, and we should not forget the keep of Arvezl inbetween.* | <li>G37:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul></ul></ul><li>U24:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists</li></ul></ul></ul><li>1139:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2858:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>1148:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier G35_stable_veykoda_frontier for 20 years</li> | [Seize the Imperial Palace](#seize_the_imperial_palace)<br /> |
| <a name="unity_of_the_sarda">Unity of the Sarda</a><br />*By Strength we gave them Order, and our rule over Sarda was restored. Some of the more far-out lordlings in Selocshana and Vels Fadhecai may yet see it differently, but it is only a matter of time before they too are brought back into the imperial fold.\n\nSo let us rule: two centuries of petty lords and betrayals have left Sarda without purpose or loyalty, yet they could not undo the legacy of the Ynnic Empire, which merely needs to be re-learned. To facilitate this process, grand councils will be hosted, with banquets so sumptuous and performances so dazzling that even the haughtiest nobles will not miss out on them. In a decade or two under our reign, all of Sarda will surely see the Greatness of House Vyrekynn.* | <li>yrw has settled second debate is yes</li><li>sarda region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is sarda</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>is not city</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is sarda</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = yrw2_different_rewards</li><li>If has yrw has settled second debate blame emperors is yes:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = G35_unity_of_sarda_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every known country has primary culture is sarda, and  is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_sarda_loyalty until otherwise removed</li></ul></ul><li>If has dynasty is "Vyrekynn":</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_the_redemption_of_house_vyrekynn until otherwise removed</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has yrw has settled second debate blame subjects is yes:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 3</li><li>If has dynasty is "Vyrekynn":</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_the_miracle_of_house_vyrekynn until otherwise removed</li></ul></ul><li>remove country modifier = G35_blunder_of_calrodiy_iv</li> | [Veykodan Guard](#veykodan_guard)<br />[The Veykodan Approach](#guard_the_veykodan_approach)<br />[Rightful Rulers of Sarda](#rightful_rulers_of_sarda)<br /> |
| <a name="march_on_mocvamsto">March on Moc Bacar</a><br />*With Sarda behind our banner, it is time we finish what Emperor Varamel set out to do when he marched with his army onto the western lands towards Dolindha.\n\nThe knights of Arganjuzorn will be easily overcome by our numbers this time, while Moc Bacar, the Dam of the Swamp, or Mocbarja as it is known in the Dolindhan tongue, still proves an intimidating chokepoint for any army seeking an entrance into Dolindha's heartlands: it is the only one, in fact, ever since the Tromseloc Way collapsed to Wendigos, Buycev and bandits. If we are to reassert control over this region, the banners of the imperial house must fly over this entrypoint once more.* | <li>mocvare area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>arganjuzorn area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>1186:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 15</li></ul> | [Unity of the Sarda](#unity_of_the_sarda)<br /> |
| <a name="vanquich_the_battlekings">Vanquish the Battlekings</a><br />*It is one thing to be upstarts, to forsake the Empire that nurtured you and protected you in favour of a new system of governance known as feudalism. It is pure madness however, to do what Lord Galadorn yen Ceped did, and launch a rebellion to restore a kingdom that exhausted its purpose over a millennium ago.\n\nMalacnar's new battlekings seek to upend the social order of the Ynn and value nothing but brute force, which fits more an apocalyptic wasteland than it does a proper empire. While we have often employed the Malacnar Battleguards and they have proven to be loyal and competent when paid well, the battlekingdom must be brought down and reincorporated into our empire.* | <li>G32:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul><li>uslad area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>drevkenuc area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>malacnar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier G35_vanquished_battlekings for 20 years</li> | [March on Moc Bacar](#march_on_mocvamsto)<br /> |
| <a name="knights_of_the_bush">Knights of the Bush</a><br />*The Knights of the Bush have been steadfast defenders of the Ynn: not only do they guard the northern border against Old Rzentur clan-warriors who covet Ynnic lands, they have also organized the coalition that repelled the Drozma Tur invasion of 1367, leading to Drozmagog’s death and the final avenging of the Great Fire of Arverynn.\n\nThe Hedge Gardens of Grebniesth and their nobles’ flowery language stand out like a vibrant rose in the rugged thorn-bush that is Dolindha. Their style and grace would be a great addition to our court in the Teal Keep, but will do them no good against our rightful might.* | <li>G28:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul><li>grebniesth area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier G35_knights_of_the_bush for 20 years</li> | [Vanquish the Battlekings](#vanquich_the_battlekings)<br /> |
| <a name="surge_beyond_the_dark_ages">Surge Beyond the Dark Ages</a><br />*By right and might, our rule is restored. From Vysamsto the High City to Adbrabohvi by the edge of the world, the imperial banners of the Teal Crest and the Vermillion Steed fly in every city, if they can be truly called cities in the same vein as Arverynn.\n\nLike our beautiful Arverynn needed decades of love and care to flourish into the city it was before the Age of the Petty Lords, generations will pass before Vareynn and Vysamsto are to be truly called jewels. Greatness will have to wait for Order, as we continue the process of Strengthening our ties with our utmost loyal vassals, settling the matter of unitary policies for them all.\n\nBy the end of it, our power will be an insurmountable crashing wave, with the Strength to drown nations, but also birth new life and grow prosperity like never before. We will see an Empire reunited, a religion reformed, and a dynasty reinstated.\n\nIt is good to be Emperors.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is surge_beyond_the_dark_ages_tt</li><li>ynn superregion:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is rzentur</li><li>culture  is dolindhan</li><li>culture   is sarda</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>stability is at least 2</li><li>legitimacy is at least 90</li><li>yrw has been reformed is yes</li> | <li>If has country modifier is G35 broken promises:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = G35_broken_promises</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_surge_beyond_dark_ages for 50 years</li> | [Bulwark of the East](#bulwark_of_the_east)<br />[Knights of the Bush](#knights_of_the_bush)<br />[Towards the High City](#towards_the_high_city)<br /> |

| <a name="a_true_vyrekynn">A True Vyrekynn</a><br />*Strength from Order. Order from Greatness.\n\nThose are the words of our house, and Carodin II is looking to embody our ideals perfectly. While Calrodiy IV brought hope and our Great dynasty back to this realm, and with it a semblance of Order, he also achieved little in the ways of Strength, his biggest “achievement” saving our city by nearly bankrupting our country with bribes to Alaran of Trompolere. Carodin II however, has magnificent plans with which we will start our reconquest of the empire.

Veykoda, the eastern overland enveloped by mist, home of tigers, wyrms and wooly rhinos, has finally been tamed. The tenacity of Cannorian homesteaders and the fury of Veykodan magic could not withstand the tides of our imperial battalions, just like their hearts of rugged stone were moved to reason by the Teal Crest’s gentle sway.\n\nMore can still be done to ease the tensions, yet a trickle of trade, migration - and most importantly, tribute - has been established between our three peoples. This trickle can become a torrent once we clear out the waterways and build more markets and river-docks, our city sure to become the one true entrepot into the Pansvovych.\n\nAt the same time, Arverynn must remain a shield, a dam that can filter out the poisonous religions of barbarians and Cannorians lest this refreshing current of change turns into a crashing wave of mud.* | <li>yrw has settled cannorian debates is yes</li><li>owns core province 1139</li><li>1139:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 80</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>num of subjects is at least 8</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 5</li><li>custom tooltip = yrw_cannorian_different_rewards</li><li>If has yrw has settled third debate guns is yes, and  has yrw has settled fourth debate cannorization is yes:</li><ul><li>If has any subject country has institution difference has who is ROOT, and institution difference has value is 1:</li><ul><li>1139:</li><ul><li>add next institution embracement = 100</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_wonders_of_the_east for 50 years</li></ul><li>Else if has yrw has settled third debate no guns is yes, and  has yrw has settled fourth debate conservative is yes:</li><ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier G35_primacy_over_the_tributaries for 50 years</li></ul><li>Else if has AND has yrw has settled third debate guns is yes, and AND has yrw has settled fourth debate conservative is yes; and has AND has yrw has settled third debate no guns is yes, and AND has yrw has settled fourth debate cannorization is yes:</li><ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier G35_a_compromise_reached for 50 years</li></ul> | [Pansvovych](#pansvovych)<br /> |

Dispassionate captains hold half-baked speeches, while bridges and roads are left to crumble. Our botanists are threatening to seek employment elsewhere, leaving our trees to wilt, and a walkway snapped under a visitor's feet the other day. Win a war against neighbouring lords? How can we, when our troops' current pay leaves them shy of even the fish jumping out of the River? It appears we will need to call forth one more sacrifice, for the good of Arverynn and the realm.\n\nOnly, let us be wary: many were the sacrifices Lord Calrodiy IV asked of his populace and friends during his rulership, and should this be for nothing one more time, the consequences will be much graver than a simply disgruntled populace.* | <li>num of loans is at least 10</li><li>has ruler "Calrodiy IV"</li> | <li>add treasury = 200</li><li>add corruption = 5</li><li>the event [Duty and Sacrifice](../events/duty_and_sacrifice.md) happens</li> |  |

Now that urgent matters are out of the way, it is time we turned our attention to this loyal subject: we hereby decree Thromshana is to be the second beneficiary of imperial public works, after the capital itself. The market square will be renewed, and we will offer audience to the mayor to listen to what the town needs to prosper, whether it be a new road or a new militia.\n\nNaturally, this will lead to closer cooperation, as imperial functionaries move to and from Thromshana to oversee the works, understating that our states are one and the same and ending any 'Free City' nonsense.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>G85:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>G85:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>owns core province 1140</li></ul></ul><li>1140:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>If has G85 has exists:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>inherit = G85</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = 0.2</li></ul><li>add estate influence modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_burghers</li><li>desc = burghers_influence_modifier</li><li>influence = 10</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = G35_tromseloc_way_tt</li> | [Rebuild our City](#rebuild_our_city)<br /> |

The banks of the Moon Field, northeast of Arverynn, offer one such swathe of fertile land waiting to be tilled by farmers, so long as we can offer them protection. The same is true for the vineyards of Horpanas, which can be renewed and expanded through alliances with the right landholders.\n\nAll around the city of Arverynn, a vast fertile plain will be painted in the colours of grain and vegetables, echoing with the calls of animals and the amiable chatter of farmer's markets.

| <a name="sarda_stability">Zalagon Pananek</a><br />*The City of Emperors notwithstanding, Ynnic society is in essence agricultural. An unwritten collection of rules and customs dictated the interactions between farmers and hunters, helping settle their disputes over game, wild crops and land ownership since ancient times. These norms were then put to law by Ynnic emperors, who tweaked them from time to time as necessity demanded.\n\nNow that our agrarian economy is a source of pride among Ynnics, attracting the interest of traders and Buyovec alike, we can re-visit these laws and organize them into a single extensive code: Zalagon Pananek, or Farmer's Law. This will bring order and stability to our demesne today, and a foundation for the entire's Ynn agricultural laws tomorrow.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>arverynn area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>arverynn area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is empty</li></ul></ul><li>years of income is at least 0.5</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has 2841 is empty:</li><ul><li>2841:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change culture = veykodan</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ynn_pomentere_estates</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add years of income = -0.5</li><li>add adm power = -50</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_sarda_stability for 20 years</li> | [Repopulate the Countryside](#repopulate_the_countryside)<br /> |

The same can be said about Arverynn, rising ever closer to the imperial pedestal - Ynn consenting, we'll be standing right next to it before we know it!\n\nAnd what better way to usher our rebirth, than to finally expand the Teal Keep? Our ever-increasing army will enjoy the additional quarters, our brilliant courtiers will marvel at the new talents within the kitchen staff, our generals will stand atop the new walls confident in the artillery-resistant runic magic, visiting nobles will find immaculate bedrooms featuring swan feather pillows that put even our most powerful Iosahar to shame.\n\nAnd all around the people of the Lower City will relish the bulwark of our power, upwards they will gaze and be awed, an array of towers and suspended walkways leading their mind and attention to the Teal Keep up high on Vyrisar Hill.* | <li>owns core province 1139</li><li>1139:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 8</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is ynnic_teal_keep</li><li>tier is at least 2</li></ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is ynnic_teal_keep</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = statesman</li><li>culture = sarda</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>skill = 3</li></ul> | [Vyrisamsto](#vyrisamsto)<br /> |

The flow of Veykodan mercenaries and adventurers to our capital has dried out, replaced by a flow of refugees pleading for the Emperor to intervene.\n\nWhile many are celebrating this ironic twist of fate - Veykodan warriors being too busy fighting for their lands to raid our borders, that is - these events risk spelling the end of the Veykodan Guard. Our most cautious advisors are even suggesting that Krarhnorians make no difference between Buycev and Ynnics, seeing both as "natives" who need to be exterminated for the glory of their nations, and that once they are done with Veykoda, we will be next.\n\nA laughable thought, for sure!

Veykodan natives were supported at times, like when in 1724 Emperor Trandir II sent a unit of Teira Manhunters to put an end to the Ivory Wars between New Havoral and the Osindain tribes, however nativism never figured among the Teal Keep's public objectives.\n\nNo imperial army marched east to rescue their fellow Ruinborn, and the vassal kingdom of Veykoda was only established through an unlikely series of events that Corinsfield's invasion set in motion.\n\nHowever, if things had gone differently, if Arverynn's rise had been faster and its grip on Sarda tighter, surely an Emperor would have rewarded the services of the Veykodan Guard by riding east, carving out a faithful client kingdom and bestowing a crown to one of their own so that they too could be King of the Castle, right?* | <li>U21:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>is core is U21</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is sarda</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = yrw1_different_rewards</li><li>If has yrw has settled first debate we embrace is yes:</li><ul><li>U21:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_radavezyr until otherwise removed</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has yrw has settled first debate we alone is yes:</li><ul><li>U21:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier G35_polersvych until otherwise removed</li></ul></ul><li>set country flag [G35_improved_guard_flag](../flags/g35_improved_guard_flag.md)</li> | [Krarhnorian Encroachment](#cannorian_encroachment)<br /> |
