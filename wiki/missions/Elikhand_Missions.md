The Dalcabba faith has seen such behavior, with every conversion making their friends and neighbors more convinced of the legitimacy of our ways. Every child born to the faith sees one more later converting.

| <a name="B38_save_masses">Serve the Masses</a><br />*My people are humble and worthy of the Khet's guidance. They do not deserve to toil in hard labor and to fear for their lives from hostile armies.

| <a name="B38_yield_power">Yield True Power</a><br />*Immortality has its benefits. When I was alive, I had precious little time to tend to my studies, especially as I was leading a band of adventurers against a horde of Orcs. I have all the time I could want to study now, and if I take advantage of it I can show to the mortal mages that my authority is to be respected.* | <li>has legitimacy equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 100</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is elikhand_entef_true_power</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>ruler is legendary in abjuration</li><li>ruler is legendary in conjuration</li><li>ruler is legendary in divination</li><li>ruler is legendary in enchantment</li><li>ruler is legendary in evocation</li><li>ruler is legendary in illusion</li><li>ruler is legendary in necromancy</li><li>ruler is legendary in transmutation</li><li>amount is at least 4</li></ul></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier elikhand_entef_mages until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = entef_modifier</li> | [Legacy of the Architect](#B38_legacy_architect)<br />[Serve the Masses](#B38_save_masses)<br /> |
| <a name="B38_empower_sarcophagus">Empower the Sarcophagus</a><br />*My sarcophagus, now centuries old since I brought it to Escann from Kheterata, could definitely use some improvements. This is not a task outside my reach, but even for me it will take some work. Once I've done this though, it will make my immortal life much more comfortable.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>769:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 40</li><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is elikhander_pyramid</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>769:</li><ul><li>development is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>custom tooltip = elikhand_sarcophagus</li><li>set country flag [b38_entef_sarcophagus](../flags/b38_entef_sarcophagus.md)</li> | [Yield True Power](#B38_yield_power)<br /> |

I am no Khet, but many view me as the resurgent champion of their will in Escann and even Cannor as a whole. I will live up to this legacy, for their sake, for my sake, and for the sake of this nation.* | <li>adm is at least 6</li><li>dip is at least 6</li><li>mil is at least 6</li><li>university is at least 50</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>religion is dalcabba</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>country gets the modifier elikhand_entef_resurgent until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = entef_modifier</li> | [Empower the Sarcophagus](#B38_empower_sarcophagus)<br /> |
