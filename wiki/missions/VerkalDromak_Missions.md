| <a name="I25_conquest1">Beyond our Walls</a><br />*Retaking Verkal Dromak was a quest to match our ancestors’ greatest, an ordeal to rival any feat of dwarfkind. Now that we have settled into our Malachite hold, we can take time to rest, to sleep and recover our energy. But when that is done, rouse the generals and assemble the troops — our work is not yet done* | <li>4323:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>jade mines region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="I25_conquest2">Hold the Jade</a><br />*Grônstunad was once the center of an empire that thrived even as most of Aul-Dwarov crumbled. Our realm is nothing like theirs, and we have no desire to emulate their tawdry ambitions and trivial pursuits.\n\nBut we will take advantage of having secured the Jade Mines in one respect. In our journey to Verkal Dromak we noted the many creatures that infest the eastern Serpentspine, squatting on dwarven land. Let’s correct that now that we finally have the opportunity to, shall we?* | <li>jade mines region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>east serpentspine superregion:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Beyond our Walls](#I25_conquest1)<br /> |
| <a name="I25_conquest3">The Mountains Beyond</a><br />*We came to these mountains to see dwarven rule restored, reclaiming the lands and holds and tunnels of our ancestors. And now that purpose is complete.\n\nWe can rest easy with the greenskins driven off, in an easy peace with the other dwarves who have joined us in this project. Yes, we shall rest indeed, and who knows what we might dream?* | <li>east serpentspine superregion:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li></ul></ul><li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>If random neighbor country has culture group is dwarven:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier I25_friend_in_dwarovar until otherwise removed</li><li>add historical friend = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier I25_friend_in_dwarovar until otherwise removed</li> | [Hold the Jade](#I25_conquest2)<br /> |

| <a name="I25_medical_school">Hall of the Medic</a><br />*The beer-halls of Hul-az-Krakazol, hall of the ale-crafter, are flowing once more, which brings a smile to any dwarf’s face (and a stein to their lips). But a few see the potential for more in its verdant gardens and clever brewers: rather than potions of delicious intoxication, they might brew potions of healing and recovery.\n\nA medical school will mark the hold taking steps beyond what it was, to what it can be. We should start construction right away.* | <li>4266:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 5 yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>custom tooltip = I25_medical_school_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [medical_school](../flags/medical_school.md)</li> | [A New Way of Being](#I25_education_of_people)<br /> |

| <a name="I25_restoration_of_altar">A Buried Altar</a><br />*In our hold there is a hall, a massive room for stately affairs. In that hall there is a subchamber, accessible only via a dusty stone stairway. In that subchamber, there is an altar, faintly aglow with enchantments still. And within that altar?\n\nWell, even the most trained mages aren’t sure. But it seems the engravings indicate some sort of ritual, which they are eager to study further.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 35</li></ul><li>4323:</li><ul><li>owned by is FROM</li><li>is a capital</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>4323:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = I25_restored_altar</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="I25_mage_tower">The Channeling Tower</a><br />*For the mages to succeed in this strange ritual, they will need a centralized space for their research and to channel their arcane energies. A tall mage tower may be an odd sight buried below miles of rock, but it must be built for our efforts to bear fruit.* | <li>4323:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier I25_mage_tower until otherwise removed</li><li>the event [An Audience with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]](../events/an_audience_with_the_root_monarch_gettitle.md) happens</li> | [A Buried Altar](#I25_restoration_of_altar)<br /> |

| <a name="I25_sort_out_problems">Sleepwalking to Success</a><br />*The recent turmoil in the hold has left no dwarf untouched, and even the most subterranean of miners has had their sleep disturbed or work interfered with by some miscast spell.\n\nBut those days are finally behind us. Lessons have been learned, and prices paid, and they are not to be forgotten but nor must we obsess over them. All may finally rest, and rest easy… and may we all dream of the bright future that lays ahead.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is I25_sort_out_problems_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [banned_magic](../flags/banned_magic.md)</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier expelled_mages</li></ul> | <li>clr country flag [banned_magic](../flags/banned_magic.md)</li><li>set estate privilege = estate_mages_organization_state</li><li>set country flag [sleeper_mages](../flags/sleeper_mages.md)</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [A Shared Dream](../events/a_shared_dream.md) happens</li><li>the event [Hidden event](../events/hidden_event.md) happens</li></ul> | [The Channeling Tower](#I25_mage_tower)<br /> |

| <a name="I25_sleeper_research_2">Sleeper Research 2</a><br />*Herbal draughts from deep within the forlorn caves of our hold send our sleepers spiraling into a more perfect slumber, replete with a newfound clarity of vision. Within the deep, chemical dreams, they see far further than most dwarves, as they stand upon the mountaintops of sleep. * | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier I25_dreaming_mission</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country modifier I25_sleeper_research</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier I25_sleeper_research for 10 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Missing localisation: verkaldromak_502_t](../events/missing_localisation_verkaldromak_502_t.md) happens</li></ul> | [Sleeper Research 1](#I25_sleeper_research_1)<br /> |

| <a name="I25_sleeper_research_4">Sleeper Research 4</a><br />*From within their palaces of silk the sleepers pull the marionette strings of their worlds, plucking wonders unknown from the soaring heights and deepest darknesses of the subliminal. From the great and terrible things they have seen, vast knowledge can be gleaned.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier I25_dreaming_mission</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country modifier I25_sleeper_research</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>add mil power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier I25_sleeper_research for 10 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Missing localisation: verkaldromak_504_t](../events/missing_localisation_verkaldromak_504_t.md) happens</li></ul> | [Sleeper Research 3](#I25_sleeper_research_3)<br /> |

The people drink it like a desperate man dying of thirst will suck the blood from his own arm just to cry out in delight. From within their slumbering worlds the sleepers see all, yet still there is more to see.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier I25_dreaming_mission</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has country modifier I25_sleeper_research</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>mil power is at least 300</li> | <li>add adm power = -300</li><li>add dip power = -300</li><li>add mil power = -300</li><li>country gets the modifier I25_sleeper_research for 10 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Go to the Source](../events/go_to_the_source.md) happens</li></ul> | [Sleeper Research 4](#I25_sleeper_research_4)<br /> |

| <a name="I25_education_of_people">A New Way of Being</a><br />*For decades, if not centuries, our state was focused on the brutal affair of wresting our great hold back from the savages that held it. Our goal was just, our methods necessary, and our victory ever-so-sweet.\n\nWith that task done, though, we are left with a predicament: Most of our people are educated in mining, and in fighting, but there are tasks much more diverse that lay ahead. We shall build new academies in every hold under our control, that teach new skills — the skills of the future, not the past.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 3 yes</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier I25_education for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="I25_dromaki_architects">Dromaki Architects</a><br />*Weird. Befuddling. Mind-twisting. Mystifying. Built by a mind that cannot be dwarven. These are but a handful of the words used by foreigners in describing Dromaki architecture. But anyone who was born here likes it, and we don’t mind outsiders being confused!* | <li>4323:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 5 yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>4323:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = I25_architects_in_capital1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A New Way of Being](#I25_education_of_people)<br /> |
| <a name="I25_architects_and_mages">Architects and Mages</a><br />*Dwarves have tended to use clever engineering rather than powerful magic in ensuring a hold is well-defended. But we Dromaki ask, why not use both? With the mages consulted in our design of Verkal Dromak’s latest set of fortifications, we can build defenses that not only stand on their own, but resonate with our mages’ myriad rituals and channel arcane energy with maximum efficiency.* | <li>4323:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 7 yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 5000</li> | <li>add treasury = -5000</li><li>4323:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = I25_architects_in_capital1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = I25_architects_in_capital2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Dromaki Architects](#I25_dromaki_architects)<br /> |
| <a name="I25_evolution_of_mazes">Evolution of Mazes</a><br />*The Dwarovar’s most legendary mazes were those built by Kekig the Maze-maker of Verkal Skomdihr, whose twisting labyrinths were said to be able to keep even the Fey themselves at bay. Our latest designs may not match his brilliance — but they do come close.\n\nAny except those who follow a Dromaki guide will be hard-pressed to even find our holds, let alone assault them.* | <li>4323:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 9 yes</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = I25_hold_mazes_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has terrain is dwarven hold surface, and has terrain is dwarven hold:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = I25_hold_mazes</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Architects and Mages](#I25_architects_and_mages)<br />[Sleeper Research 1](#I25_sleeper_research_1)<br /> |

| <a name="I25_diplomat_school">School of Diplomats</a><br />*In Verkal Dromak, we have always looked inward, peering into the mysteries that abound about us. If we had an opposite, perhaps it was the hold of Grôzumdihr, which sent countless envoys to the Raheni and maintained cordial, if not friendly, with almost every other hold even during the Last Days of the Dwarovar.\n\nWith the Peridot Hold finally matching its prior glory, we should ensure this tradition is not lost either. Dig up the hold’s lost writings and use them as the foundation of a new school, to ensure all our diplomats act in the finest traditions of Grôzumdihr (for the advancement of Verkal Dromak, of course).* | <li>4313:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 5 yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>custom tooltip = I25_diplomat_school_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [diplomat_school](../flags/diplomat_school.md)</li> | [A New Way of Being](#I25_education_of_people)<br /> |
| <a name="I25_durable_constructions">Durable Constructions</a><br />*It is clear that there are certain lessons known to ancient dwarven engineers that remain beyond us now. But the recent dream of an engineer who fell asleep on (thankfully, empty) railroad tracks gave us insight into some of the principles which have led to the ancient rail still being present (if inoperational), and that knowledge should bolster constructions closer to home as well.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>value is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = I25_durable_constructions_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [durable_constructions](../flags/durable_constructions.md)</li> | [Dromaki Architects](#I25_dromaki_architects)<br /> |

Even when we wake, we shall follow the same principle — we will ignore the protestations of anyone else who seeks to influence our hold’s direction, and hew to the sleeper’s path alone.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 30</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 30</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>influence is at least 30</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier I25_estates_curtailed until otherwise removed</li><li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = all</li><li>share = -10</li></ul><li>remove country modifier = I25_ruler_killed_estates_debuff</li> | [Position of Power](#I25_position_of_power)<br /> |

Similarly, there are no dreams more important than that of our monarch, for those visions are what keep us to the path ahead.\n\nIn line with their pre-eminence, we shall enshrine a new tradition for our monarch. They shall spend half the year in a magically-enhanced sleep, to dream and dream and dream, and the other half spend awake with nigh-absolute control over the state to ensure we follow the dream’s guidance to the utmost.* | <li>monthly adm is at least 12</li><li>monthly dip is at least 12</li><li>monthly mil is at least 12</li> | <li>add government reform = verkal_dromak_sleeper_monarch</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Missing localisation: verkaldromak_73_t](../events/missing_localisation_verkaldromak_73_t.md) happens</li></ul> | [We Need More Sleep](#I25_we_need_more_sleep)<br /> |

It is not an uncommon duty, indeed it is perhaps the most practiced rite, given it dates back to the Last Days of the Dwarovar themselves.

Not even to a forceful shove, nor the concerted ram of two of my guardsmen. It took an embarrassed engineer over an hour to finally get it loose, but I for the most part ignored her mumbles about water seepage and temperature imbalance -- I was struck by the fine ornamentation on the portalway, something I had never really noticed before.
