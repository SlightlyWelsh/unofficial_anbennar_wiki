| <a name="jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult">Deal with the Xhazobkult</a><br />*The duties of Surael are our own, and no duty has more import than His commandment to fight against the darkness. It is clear there is no greater encroaching darkness than the demonic worship of the Xhazobkult. We must destroy it and break its power over the gnolls.* | <li>garpix zokka area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>religion is the_jadd</li></ul> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bulwar superregion has culture group is gnollish, and does not have religion is the jadd:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult_tooltip</li> | [Summon the Legionaries](#jaddari_summon_the_legionaries)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_enlighten_the_gnoll">Enlighten the Gnolls</a><br />*The gnolls close to our home have been brought into the light. However there are still many that live in Bulwar that follow the Xhazobkult. A great start has been made, but let us spread the truth to all gnolls, that they might find meaning and redemption in Surael's embrace.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is jaddari_enlighten_the_gnoll_tt</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>culture group is gnollish</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is the_jadd</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>largest increase of gnollish tolerance effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = gnollish_race_tolerance_ai</li><li>value = 30</li></ul></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add gnollish minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Deal with the Xhazobkult](#jaddari_deal_with_the_xhazobkult)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_western_harpies">The Western Harpies</a><br />*While the Siadunan harpies in the east are sociable and capable of reasonable dealings, the harpies in the west are said to be much more difficult. We will first take their land and bring them into the Jadd and after that we'll see what their purpose is in Surael's crusade.* | <li>frenyantlen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>invaders pass area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>harpylen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F21</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>If harpy hills region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Upper Suran Plain](#jaddari_upper_suran_plain)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_birsantanses_kneels">Birzartanšes Kneels</a><br />*The Harpy Hills are an area that is exceedingly difficult to control. And while they are our enemy, Birzartanšes has historically done a good job of managing the rough terrain. It is clear that Surael has chosen that to be their purpose in His crusade; let us subjugate them that we can make use of their experience.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F21:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Birsartanses</li></ul><li>549:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = jaddari_gain_permanent_claims_to_ovdal_tungr_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bahar region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have area is crathanor area, and does not have area is reuyel area, and does not have province id is 525:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [The Western Harpies](#jaddari_the_western_harpies)<br />[The Heart of Bulwar](#jaddari_the_heart_of_bulwar)<br /> |

| <a name="jaddari_up_to_ovdal_tungr">Up to Ovdal Tûngr</a><br />*Bahar is the great access to Cannor, and the great gate of Bahar is the hold of the Copper Dwarves. But since the Decades of Devastation the region is a mess. We must bring order and light to this chaotic region. Dwarf, human, elf and goblin will live in harmony under the sun of Surael, and under our rule.* | <li>526:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If crathanor area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If reuyel area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>525:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul></ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Birzartanšes Kneels](#jaddari_birsantanses_kneels)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel">Subjugating Re'uyel</a><br />*The Republic of Re'uyel was one of the few of those under the sway of the Sun Elves to throw off their shackles and stand up to their lies. We have since greatly admired their conviction and we must integrate that spirit into our realm. We deeply need those who see the sun clearly to spread the light of Surael.* | <li>516:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>521:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If lorbet area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If busilar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If busilari straits area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If isle of tef area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Up to Ovdal Tûngr](#jaddari_up_to_ovdal_tungr)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_ports_of_businor">The Ports of Businor</a><br />*The Divenhal is a great sea and we have found our navies and shipyards sadly lacking. If we manage to seize the ports of Businor we will be able to ensure total control over the eastern portion of this great inland sea and build up a navy so that no one can contest it.* | <li>365:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>380:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is businor_region</li><li>has port</li><li>value is at least 8</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier jaddari_shipbuilding_spree for 20 years</li><li>If businor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dostanor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If daravans folly region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ourdia region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Subjugating Re'uyel](#jaddari_the_subjugation_of_reuyel)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_prepare_suraels_armada">Surael's Armada</a><br />*Under Jaher, under Jexis, under Jaddar, the legions marched. But as we look towards the setting sun, it is clear now they must float. Every shipyard in Bulwar and Businor must be devoted to the construction of Surael's Armada to ensure His light, and our rule, stretches far across the sea.* | <li>num of heavy ship is at least 20</li><li>num of galley is at least 80</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is businor_region</li><li>region  is bahar_region</li><li>region   is harpy_hills_region</li><li>region    is bulwar_proper_region</li><li>region     is north_salahad_region</li></ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>value is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier jaddari_naval_support for 25 years</li><li>If khenak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If wyvernmark area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If verne area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If menibor loop area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>51:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul></ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If damespearl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Ports of Businor](#jaddari_the_ports_of_businor)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_suns_sea">The Sun's Sea</a><br />*The Armada is ready. Wood from the Raheni jungles has been worked by Copper Dwarven craftsmen into creations that honour Surael with their very being. But His purpose demands more, and it is time for the Desert Elves to set forth into the waters, and begin to claim the sea as Surael's own.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is jaddari_the_suns_sea_tt</li><li>owns core province 46</li><li>owns core province  43</li><li>owns core province   14</li><li>owns core province    51</li><li>owns core province     283</li><li>owns core province      286</li><li>owns core province       288</li><li>owns core province        290</li><li>owns core province         291</li><li>owns core province          375</li><li>owns core province           376</li></ul> | <li>If silverwoods area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If damerian dales area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If neckcliffe area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If windtower area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If eastneck area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tretunica area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If eastern winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If upper winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lower bloodwine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lower winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If sornhills area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Surael's Armada](#jaddari_prepare_suraels_armada)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_dames_neck">The Dame's Neck</a><br />*The Dame is one of many Gods the Cannorian Heathens believed in, but who in truth perished millennia ago. Her embodiment in the lasting Cannorian perception of their inland sea is thus a morbid funereal mask. A sad relic of a sad collection of beliefs; we must seize the entrance to the Dameshead, and ensure the sea's legacy — and wealth — do not keep the surrounding peoples from embracing Surael's light.* | <li>silverwoods area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>damerian dales area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>neckcliffe area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>windtower area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If east dameshead region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If west dameshead region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Sun's Sea](#jaddari_the_suns_sea)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_regain_anbenncost">Regain Anbenncóst</a><br />*During the Decade of Masks, the Empress Jexis ruled the Phoenix Empire from Anbenncóst. The Burned Empress led her father's empire to its vastest expanse, and fought wars both overt and covert against her rival to the west, Ioriel. It was not until her assassination in 1161 AA that the Empire fell, and Anbenncóst was lost.\n\nWe do not fight our wars in the shadows, we wage Surael's crusade under the light of His bright sun. But despite these differences, Jaddar was Jexis's heir, and so is the Jadd Empire. Anbenncóst is our birthright, and we must make that clear to those who claim it now.* | <li>west damesear area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>east damesear area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province 8</li> | <li>custom tooltip = jaddari_regain_anbenncost_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If damescrown region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and  has port:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If esmaria region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and  has port:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [The Dame's Neck](#jaddari_the_dames_neck)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_heart_of_cannor">The Heart of Cannor</a><br />*'What is the purpose of a body's heart, if it lacks a soul?' It is an important question, especially when examining the Dameshead, the heart of West Cannor. While the states here may lay content with their wealth and prosperity, it all lacks meaning if not directed towards Surael's purpose. We must enlighten them all to this truth.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is jaddari_the_heart_of_cannor_tt</li><li>damescrown region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>east dameshead region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>esmaria region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>west dameshead region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If esmaria region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If damescrown region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If the borders region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Regain Anbenncóst](#jaddari_regain_anbenncost)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_unity_under_the_jadd">Unity Under the Jadd</a><br />*For centuries, the Cannorians have sought unity. At the Grand Summit of Aranthíl, they thought it could be achieved by a mage-ruled peace. After the Wars of Rule, they thought it could be upheld by an elected Emperor. Even the chaos of the Lilac Wars failed to dissuade them of this notion.\n\nFor all their struggling was in vain. True unity can only be achieved under Surael's light, by following the tenets of the Jadd. Now, finally, may they know unity.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is east_dameshead_region</li><li>region  is esmaria_region</li><li>region   is the_borders_region</li><li>region    is west_dameshead_region</li><li>region     is damescrown_region</li></ul><li>religion is the_jadd</li><li>value is at least 180</li></ul><li>eoa is dismantled is yes</li> | <li>country gets the modifier jaddari_the_jadd_union for 40 years</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>If has reform is jadd empire, and does not have country flag is [jaddari_static_court](../flags/jaddari_static_court.md):</li><ul><li>the event [The Seat of the Court](../events/the_seat_of_the_court.md) happens</li></ul> | [The Heart of Cannor](#jaddari_the_heart_of_cannor)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_anbennarian_administration">Anbennarian Administration</a><br />*While Anbennar has finally been unified into one state under our rule, the region's diversity was its strength, and we should not forget that fact. In Anbenncóst, Surael's sun now shines above a city which seems a microcosm of Halann entire. We should ensure our entire Empire follows a similar model, every person and people united in labour and embodying Surael's glory.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 8</li><li>religion is the_jadd</li><li>base tax is at least 20</li><li>base production is at least 20</li><li>base manpower is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier jaddari_anbennarian_administration until otherwise removed</li> | [Unity Under the Jadd](#jaddari_unity_under_the_jadd)<br /> |

| <a name="jaddari_summon_the_legionaries">Summon the Legionaries</a><br />*It is time to start the great campaign. The Sun Elves in Bulwar have not fulfilled their duties to Surael and they have let the Xhazobkult profane an appallingly large swath of land. Someone more capable must take over and right these wrongs. Let Jaddar call the legions together — it is time to take Bulwar's fate into our own hands.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>If garpix zokka area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If arrtukerr area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If jikarzax area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If grixek area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If azka sur area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>2913:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="jaddari_seize_azka_sur">Seize Azka-Sur</a><br />*Azka-Sur, the fortress of the sun, is the furthest eastwards bastion of the Cult. It will serve as an example of our dominance over the Cult and the starting point for the spread of Surael's truths as revealed to Jaddar. Its fertile lands can also make for a good base to build our empire upon.* | <li>643:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If far bulwar region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Summon the Legionaries](#jaddari_summon_the_legionaries)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_upper_suran_plain">The Upper Suran Plain</a><br />*The Suran is the most important river of Bulwar. By capturing the upper plains we can start to reap the benefits of cultivatable land. It is also the first step in the conquest of the entire region. The breach will set us up for the conquest of the rest of Bulwar and the formation of a new Phoenix Empire.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>region is far_bulwar_region</li></ul><li>owns core province 625</li> | <li>If bulwar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south naza area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If east naza area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If north naza area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If traz buranun area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If harklum area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If invaders pass area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If frenyantlen area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If traz buranun area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If harpylen area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If is year is 1500:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 200</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier jaddari_rise_of_an_empire for 25 years</li></ul> | [Seize Azka-Sur](#jaddari_seize_azka_sur)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_heart_of_bulwar">The Heart of Bulwar</a><br />*The entire region is named after this single city: Bulwar. In truth, the metropolis has seen better days and has now been overtaken by Brasan as mercantile center of the region. But it remains the heart of the culture. It remains the heart of the religion. And when we control it? Well, we have the entire region by its heart.* | <li>bulwar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province 601</li> | <li>If irrliam area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If anzarzax area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If anzabad area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If kumarkand area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If zansap area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Upper Suran Plain](#jaddari_upper_suran_plain)<br /> |

| <a name="jaddari_the_suran_delta">The Suran Delta</a><br />*We hold most of the Suran in our grasp, but one essential part is still missing. In the delta sits the city of Brasan, the largest in Bulwar. With Brasan we have total dominance over the lifeblood of Bulwar (along with some sugar from the nearby marshes, to sweeten our grasp). We will hold the Suran from source to sea and we will be the undisputed power in Bulwar.* | <li>lower brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>upper brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province 565</li> | <li>If bulwar proper region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Lower Suran Plain](#jaddari_lower_suran_plain)<br /> |
| <a name="jaddari_the_salahad_gate">The Salahad Gate</a><br />*Bulwar is a fortress for one who holds all of it. The Serpentspine guards its northern front and the Salahad its south and east. To the west is the Divenhal sea. These gates guard narrow passes, and the few caravan paths that lead out and in. Holding those will allow total control of the entry and exit into and out of Bulwar.

While the Mountain of Clear Sight has lasting infrastructure as our long-time capital, the Temple at Azka-Sur will require a full refurbishment and expansion.

And now that it has found the truest wealth in all Halann, that of Surael's embrace, it is a shining jewel in our crown.\n\nAnd yet... one small manor, just outside the city gates, seems to somehow resist the light.

And we hear of even greater riches upstream: a font of gems unending at the river's source.\n\nIt is time to send an expedition up the river, to ensure all that wealth is put to its proper purpose: glorifying Surael's name.* | <li>owns core province 4941</li><li>owns core province  4789</li><li>owns core province   4565</li><li>owns core province    4777</li><li>owns core province     4776</li><li>owns core province      5424</li> | <li>If thidinkai region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Forts of Bomdan](#jaddari_the_forts_of_bomdan)<br /> |

Jaher attempted an invasion of his own, but a bloc of Kai states kept him off, until he sought richer opportunities in Yanshen.\n\nHowever, we see further than the conquerors of yore. The most valuable treasure is the soul, and it is priceless. Whatever the land may possess, its people are as important as any other in Surael's crusade.

But no part of Halann feels quite as foreign as the Yanglamese jungles: the lush rainforest, brutal humidity, and abundant rivers are all almost unimaginable to the mind of a Desert Elf.\n\nStill, our purpose remains clear. The many kings of these lands must be made to see that Surael is the true sovereign of every being on Halann, and The Jadd is His truth.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>region is lupulan_rainforest_region</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul><li>owns core province 4701</li><li>owns core province  4962</li><li>owns core province   4963</li> | <li>country gets the modifier jaddari_controlling_the_haless_trade for 50 years</li> | [The Thidinkai Plain](#jaddari_the_thidinkai_plain)<br /> |

Some thought them obviously joking, offering up raw superstition of a people far from Surael's light. Others believed that just as we were that light made real, we should not disregard the possibility of a similar embodiment of the darkness.\n\nBut after our first forays into the Demon Hills, it quickly became clear that these 'Oni' are a people like any other, though both stronger and wiser than most. Hopefully, that wisdom should mean they quickly see the truth of The Jadd, and we look forward to the day they have all embraced Surael's brilliance — we have much to learn from both their ancient knowledge and their ferocious rage.* | <li>accepted culture is horned_ogre</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is jaddari_the_strength_of_a_demon_tt</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>culture is horned_ogre</li></ul><li>religion is the_jadd</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>largest increase of ogre tolerance effect = yes</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add ogre minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier jaddari_oni_of_the_jadd for 25 years</li> | [The Commandment](#jaddari_the_commandment)<br /> |

Some have power centres in a handful of influential regions or cities, scattered like stars in the night sky. Others have power divided between two blocs, each waxing and waning in phases akin to the moon. But there is only one Sun in the sky, and it is Surael's.

As such, there is no one place that has a special claim to be closest to Surael, and thus be the ideal site for the Herald to sit and lead His Empire. That truth (and the exigencies of such a wide-ranging Empire) mean a variety of cities have considerable attraction as the site for the Radiant Court. Furthermore, some argue that just as the sun crosses the entire sky in its courses, so too should Surael's Court make its home in every part of the realm.\n\nWhatever the Divine Herald's thoughts on that argument, it is high time to formalize the process for choosing a court, and ensure a shared infrastructure to maintain bureaucratic continuity wherever it goes. No matter its seat, after all, we know Surael's Court shall be the center of the Jadd Empire, and thus of all Halann.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is jaddari_have_unlocked_5_court_seats_tt</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 643</li><li>province id  is at least 601</li><li>province id   is at least 2909</li><li>province id    is at least 565</li><li>province id     is at least 8</li><li>province id      is at least 4411</li><li>province id       is at least 4420</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 4500</li><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [aizt_ralare_founded_flag](../flags/aizt_ralare_founded_flag.md)</li></ul></ul><li>province id        is at least 4871</li><li>AND:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 625</li><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>has country flag [jaddanzar_founded_flag](../flags/jaddanzar_founded_flag.md)</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add government reform = jaddari_mobile_centralization</li><li>If has reform is jadd empire, and does not have country flag is [jaddari_static_court](../flags/jaddari_static_court.md):</li><ul><li>the event [The Seat of the Court](../events/the_seat_of_the_court.md) happens</li></ul> | [The Radiant Court](#jaddari_the_radiant_court)<br /> |

From the smallest kobold to the largest ogre, from the cleverest gnome to the strongest harimari, the Jadd and its seat embrace all.\n\nAlthough the Herald shall always be Surael's sole voice on Halann, and the Imperial Court the Empire's sole center, there is obviously much wisdom to be drawn from across our realm. We should thus establish a formalized system for the Herald to consult the many peoples and places that make up the Empire, drawing on the finest examples every species has to offer: the Jadd Exemplary.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is jaddari_the_jadd_exemplary_trigger_tt</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has human minority trigger yes</li><li>has human majority trigger yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has elven minority trigger yes</li><li>has elven majority trigger yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has harimari minority trigger yes</li><li>has harimari majority trigger yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has harpy minority trigger yes</li><li>has harpy majority trigger yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has gnollish minority trigger yes</li><li>has gnollish majority trigger yes</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has dwarven minority trigger yes</li><li>has dwarven majority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add government reform = jadd_exemplary</li> | [The Courts of Surael](#jaddari_the_many_courts_of_surael)<br /> |

And every Divine Herald is the interpreter of Surael's will. But it is clear that [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been chosen by Surael for especially great things, and that [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] purpose is a great one. When [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] walks on the sand, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] footprints left behind a glow; when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] draws [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] blade, it shines a brilliant white; [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] very presence in a room seems to illuminate it as the sun.\n\nAnd most of all, when [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] speaks — it is as if Surael himself is speaking [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] words.* | <li>ruler has personality is mage_personality</li><li>ruler is legendary in enchantment</li> | <li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jaddari_the_voice_of_surael</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul> | [The Jadd Exemplary](#jaddari_the_jadd_exemplary)<br /> |

The Corinites took this a step further, inventing a whole mythology about Agrados's fall and Corin's rebirth. We never gave them much attention or credence, and indeed it is beyond us why they spend so much time discussing Gods that perished millennia ago.\n\nBut with [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s rule of our nation, some have recalled those heathen musings, and wondered if there was not a grain of truth buried amidst their false beliefs. For if there was ever a single person since Jaher within whom Surael seemed to imbue His power, it would be the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In grace, fortitude, brilliance, strength, radiance, sheer power — no monarch before can compare, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] only rival is the Sun itself. And under [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] reign, the Jadd Empire — all of Halann — shall never be the same.* | <li>adm is at least 6</li><li>dip is at least 6</li><li>mil is at least 6</li><li>ruler has personality is mage_personality</li><li>ruler is legendary in enchantment</li><li>absolutism is at least 100</li> | <li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = jaddari_scion_of_surael</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul> | [The Voice of Surael](#jaddari_the_voice_of_surael)<br /> |

Today? Like the after-image of a bright light when you close your eyes, those memories are already fading, becoming out of date. If we are to triumph in this bitter conflict, we must know our enemy like we know ourselves — for indeed, despite all this foolishness, it was and remains rightfully a part of our Empire.

A song of yearning for home, of longing, of loss.\n\nEver since dehydrated soldiers were saved by the Elayenna harpies, the Desert Elves have known well the value of water, and to never waste that precious resource. Still, rare is the Desert Elf who will not be moved to tears by Soin El, whether it is hummed by his brothers the night before a battle or played in full symphony at the summer solstice festival.
