| <a name="Y66_the_coalition_victory">The Coalition Victory</a><br />*The Yansheni pirates of Pinghoi have raided our coasts for far too long, even going so far as to seize our territories and the territories of our loyal ally, the chiefdom of Hebat Hari, in recent years. This is intolerable, and must not be permitted to stand. It is time for us to remind these foreigners that it is we who rule and they who must obey - or perish.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Y76</li><li>Y76:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>4699:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4701:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4961:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>harumbasai area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Y76</li></ul> | <li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = Y76</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul> | [The Internal Strife](#Y66_the_internal_strife)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_solemn_oath">The Solemn Oath</a><br />*In the aftermath of our common victory over the pirates of Pinghoi, ties between ourselves and our erstwhile ally, the chiefdom of Hebat Hari, have grown closer than ever before. Now, the time has come: their chief, [Y76.Monarch.GetName], has proceeded to Tuan Caoban to swear a solemn oath. Under these terms, Hebat Hari shall return to the fold and submit to vassalage once more. They shall be an example to our many former vassals: now, this is true loyalty!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>Y76:</li><ul><li>trust:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 80</li></ul></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Y76</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>alliance with is Y76</li></ul><li>Y76:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = the_solemn_oath_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>Y76:</li><ul><li>the event [Hon Sai ask us to join them](../events/hon_sai_ask_us_to_join_them.md) happens</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 10</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = new_decision_ghostemperor_tt</li><li>set country flag [hebat_hari_practitioner](../flags/hebat_hari_practitioner.md)</li> | [The Coalition Victory](#Y66_the_coalition_victory)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_coastal_defense_network">The Coastal Defense</a><br />*Year after year we get reports of our coastal cities, telling us of plundering and horrible atrocities from the pirates. The trade flowing through Cay Cam Sinh is getting blockaded, essentially blocking us from the lucrative trade routes to the golf of Rahen. We should erect coastal defenses along the shore to block the pirates from landing.* | <li>4701:</li><ul><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li></ul><li>navy size percentage is at least 0.75</li> | <li>the event [Secure the Coastline](../events/secure_the_coastline.md) happens</li><li>custom tooltip = honsai_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = honsai_reward</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The Reborn Kingdom](#Y66_the_reborn_kingdom)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_pirates">The Pirates</a><br />*These pirates are worse than the Lupulan's demon-ants! Crush one island base and two more pop up, defeat one fleet at sea and by the time you're ashore, you hear of two more raids already done. This continued irritant offends the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but our efforts have been lackluster so far.\n\nPerhaps it takes a pirate to fight a pirate. It may be expensive, but if we can pay one of our foes to root out the other, it will be well worth it.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Y53:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>Y64:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has country flag is [pruhakin_chosen](../flags/pruhakin_chosen.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = the_pirates_1_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If south haless superregion does not have core is Y53; and does not have permanent claim is Y53; and  has owned by is Y64:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = Y53</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [pinghoi_chosen](../flags/pinghoi_chosen.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = the_pirates_2_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bomdan region does not have core is Y64; and does not have permanent claim is Y64; and  has owned by is Y53:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = Y64</li></ul></ul></ul><li>4701:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = honsai_friendly_pirate_outpost</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = honsai_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = honsai_reward</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The Coastal Defense](#Y66_the_coastal_defense_network)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_pirate_wars">The Pirate Wars</a><br />*The sword we have taken up is more of a pirate cutlass -- rusty, blunt, and you're always at risk of self-injury. But [Root.Monarch.GetName] is not merely a good [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is a great one, and that entails being able to use even the most inopportune of instruments.\n\nThe Pirate Wars begin. They will end when our foe is scourged from the sea and our coast is secure (our rivals'... may be less so).* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has country flag [pruhakin_chosen](../flags/pruhakin_chosen.md)</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y64</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has country flag [pinghoi_chosen](../flags/pinghoi_chosen.md)</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Prukakhin</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier honsai_pirate_free_waters until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier honsai_pirate_expertise for 50 years</li><li>custom tooltip = the_pirate_wars_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bomdan region has culture is gon, and does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If has country flag is [pruhakin_chosen](../flags/pruhakin_chosen.md):</li><ul><li>Y53:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier honsai_loyal_pirate_subject until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier honsai_colonize_the_ringlet_isles for 50 years</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [pinghoi_chosen](../flags/pinghoi_chosen.md):</li><ul><li>Y64:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier honsai_loyal_pirate_subject until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier honsai_colonize_the_ringlet_isles for 50 years</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = honsai_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = honsai_reward</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The Pirates](#Y66_the_pirates)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_fate_of_the_gon">The Fate of the Gon</a><br />*Under Baihon Xinh, the Gon were an integral part of the "triple alliance" that saw Phonan, Khom, and Gon all thrive together. But outside it, prosperity has turned to poverty, cooperation to conflict.\n\nWe must reunify the Gon within [Root.GetName]. Only then will they re-achieve the vibrancy of prior days.* | <li>bomdan region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is gon</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = the_fate_of_the_gon_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bomdan region has culture is gon, and  has owner is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li></ul><li>If every owned province has culture is gon:</li><ul><li>add nationalism = -5</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = honsai_accelerated_integration</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>If has Y53 is subject of is ROOT; and  is core is Y53:</li><ul><li>remove core = Y53</li></ul><li>If has Y64 is subject of is ROOT; and  is core is Y64:</li><ul><li>remove core = Y64</li></ul><li>If has Y58 is subject of is ROOT; and  is core is Y58:</li><ul><li>remove core = Y58</li></ul><li>If has Y51 is subject of is ROOT; and  is core is Y51:</li><ul><li>remove core = Y51</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If banhlubei area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4802:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = honsai_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = honsai_reward</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The Pirate Wars](#Y66_the_pirate_wars)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_defense_act">The Defense Act</a><br />*Fort Taibo was our might shield against Jaher's nigh-unstoppable might. Then, in the traitor-son's war, it was an anchor, as steady as the Ghost-Emperor's will. We must ensure it can remain a keystone of our defence for centuries to come, adapting to the new style of a siege and rebuilding its walls to resist even the most concentrated of cannon fire.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 750</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -750</li><li>4698:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = honsai_taibo_construction</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = the_defense_act_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Construction Complete at Taibo](../events/construction_complete_at_taibo.md) happens</li></ul> | [The Protector](#Y66_the_protector)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_artillery_doctrine">The Artillery Doctrine</a><br />*Some rely on cannons for direct military support, their devastation ensuring a charge breaks enemy lines. Others use it more sporadically, to shore up weak-points and turn the tides where their men might be faltering.\n\nOthers, who lack our mastery of the cannon, have to choose. We, on the other hand, can integrate artillery into every part of our military and every piece of our tactical regimen. When our reforms are complete, none in Haless (or perhaps Halann) will be able to challenge our mastery of the art of direct and indirect fire.* | <li>army professionalism is at least 0.5</li><li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is artillery_power</li><li>value is at least 0.25</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier honsai_militaryreform_training until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = the_arillery_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [New Artillery Doctrine](../events/new_artillery_doctrine.md) happens</li></ul> | [The Defense Act](#Y66_the_defense_act)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_subjugation">The Subjugation</a><br />*Bomdan: a land of great rivers, great wealth, and great forts. In the name of Baihon Xinh, we will seize all three, and ensure it finds its rightful place in the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s domain. This will fully protect our western flank, enabling us to further expand our delicate infrastructure.* | <li>bomdan region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is banhlubei_area</li><li>culture is gon</li><li>province id is at least 4802</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>area is banhlubei_area</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>culture is gon</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 4802</li></ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = the_subjugation2_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is sikai:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = honsai_postal_network</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = the_subjugation_tt</li> | [The Western Welfare Zone](#Y66_the_western_welfare_zone)<br /> |

| <a name="Y66_the_reconquest">The Reconquest</a><br />*When Caoban Dinh took up arms against his father in defiance of all common sense and custom, our erstwhile vassal of Nagon declared independence in an attempt to take advantage of our temporary weakness. We may have permitted this to stand for a matter of years, but this was never intended to be a permanent state of affairs. Let us return Nagon to the fold!* | <li>nagon area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>nagon area:</li><ul><li>add nationalism = -5</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = honsai_accelerated_integration</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [The Internal Strife](#Y66_the_internal_strife)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_unity">The Unity</a><br />*Caoban Dinh's rebellion was a momentary but immensely traumatic rupture, splintering three peoples that had once been one. The cultural capitals of Mairuk, Tuan Caoban and Hubai Mong found themselves on opposing sides, ruled by three monarchs who claimed to be independent from one another. Now, though, all three cities accept the sovereignty of one power: ourselves. Let us restore harmony and balance to the realm.* | <li>accepted culture is khom</li><li>accepted culture  is phonan</li><li>accepted culture   is gon</li> | <li>4703:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>4771:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>4763:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [The Reconquest](#Y66_the_reconquest)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_succession">The Succession</a><br />*The sons of Caobang Sang thought to impose their own succession plans on great [Root.GetName], and paid dearly for their treachery. But they were not wrong, that there will come a day where we must carry on our patriarch's legacy without his presence. We must ensure a smooth transition, fully in line with the Ghost-Emperor's will, and to do so we should start planning immediately.* | <li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>add mil power = -200</li><li>the event [Prepare for Succession](../events/prepare_for_succession.md) happens</li><li>custom tooltip = the_succession_tt</li><li>set country flag [honsai_succession](../flags/honsai_succession.md)</li> | [The Reborn Kingdom](#Y66_the_reborn_kingdom)<br /> |

| <a name="Y66_the_retribution">The Retribution</a><br />*We of [Root.GetName] know well what it is to be vulnerable -- and then have your neighbours pounce. The rage it inspires, the enmity.\n\nAnd so we well understood the diplomats from Hebat Hari, who sought our aid against the devastating raids they have suffered recently. They will have it, along with all our skills at retribution.* | <li>sawuladan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Y76</li></ul><li>loratana area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Y76</li></ul><li>sirtan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Y76</li></ul> | <li>Y76:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier honsai_loyal_march_1 for 20 years</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = statesman</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.5</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = honsai_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = honsai_reward</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The Dwarves](#Y66_the_dwarves)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_vassal_reforms">The Vassal Reforms</a><br />*With the recent conquests the size of Hebat Hari grew considerably, putting a strain on their primitive tribal form of government. They seek to improve the situation by making the necessary reforms. In the last annual meeting they asked for know-how and help in doing so. We should take this opportunity to form their state to our greatest benefits.* | <li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>statesman is at least 3</li><li>num of diplomats is at least 1</li><li>Y76:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = the_vassal_reforms_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Reforms in Hebat Hari](../events/reforms_in_hebat_hari.md) happens</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier honsai_diplomatic_mission_1 until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = honsai_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = honsai_reward</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The Retribution](#Y66_the_retribution)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_vassal_act">The Vassal Act</a><br />*A tree must be served by every root, a river must be fed by every tributary. Just as well, we must ensure every vassal that pays tribute and owes allegiance to [Root.GetName] is properly integrated into our administration. Being able to handle such a variety of semi-autonomous states will require a restructuring of our bureaucracy, but it is necessary for [Root.GetName]'s continued prosperity.* | <li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>num of subjects is at least 3</li> | <li>If has government is monarchy:</li><ul><li>add government reform = honsai_the_commonwealth_mon</li></ul><li>If has government is republic:</li><ul><li>add government reform = honsai_the_commonwealth_rep</li></ul><li>the event [The Mercenary Administrators](../events/the_mercenary_administrators.md) happens</li> | [The Protector](#Y66_the_protector)<br /> |
| <a name="Y66_the_western_welfare_zone">The Western Welfare Zone</a><br />*The west has been secured, but there is no need for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to busy [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] with every aspect of the land's administration. The Daulophs of Lot Dekkang earn their nobility by their skills as a mercenary; it should not be too much work to convince that state (whose tolerant values echo our own) to expand their 'mercenary' role, and act as hired administrators of the region in our stead.* | <li>Y58:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If lupulan rainforest region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have core is Y76; and does not have permanent claim is Y76; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = Y76</li></ul><li>If bomdan region does not have area is khindi area; and does not have area is cmor krueng area; and does not have area is lower telebei area; and does not have area is reanthung area; and does not have core is ROOT; and does not have core is Y58; and does not have permanent claim is Y58; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = Y58</li></ul><li>If has country flag is [pruhakin_chosen](../flags/pruhakin_chosen.md):</li><ul><li>If bomdan region has area is khindi area, and has area is cmor krueng area, and has area is lower telebei area, and has area is reanthung area; and does not have core is ROOT; and does not have core is Y53; and does not have permanent claim is Y53; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = Y53</li></ul></ul><li>If has country flag is [pinghoi_chosen](../flags/pinghoi_chosen.md):</li><ul><li>If bomdan region has area is khindi area, and has area is cmor krueng area, and has area is lower telebei area, and has area is reanthung area; and does not have core is ROOT; and does not have core is Y64; and does not have permanent claim is Y64; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = Y64</li></ul></ul> | [The Vassal Act](#Y66_the_vassal_act)<br /> |

With the advent of peace, our armies are free to rest and recuperate, replenishing their stores and refilling their ranks. They shall train and drill in their barracks until the Emperor once again requires their services.* | <li>is not at war</li> | <li>country gets the modifier honsai_recover_from_the_civil_war for 10 years</li> |  |

At long last the revolts from both traitorous kin and unfaithful "allies"  have been put down and the lands of Baihon Xinh once more know tranquility and the prosperity of just rule. That however is not even the height of our accomplishments. We have at long last brought true unity to our lands as never seen even in the days of Jaher's foolhardy attempts to conquer our great nation. Now we stand as one and we shall see to it that nothing shall ever again shatter our unity.

| <a name="Y66_the_northern_granary">The Northern Granary</a><br />*The first step in taking back control over southern Haless lies in the northern flood plains.
