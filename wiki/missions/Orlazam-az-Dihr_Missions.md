| <a name="ramsteel_old_flocks">Search for the Old Flocks</a><br />*With the formally bountiful Vale turned into little more than a flooded mire, the flocks of sheep that used to graze here are gone.

| <a name="ramsteel_gelkalis_breed">The Gelkalis Breed</a><br />*Now that the western Serpentspine has been restored to the dwarves with only minor exceptions, the trade has also started its sluggish flow through. With this flow comes rumours and gossip of all kinds, of course. Our notice has been drawn to stories of the Gelkalis humans and their mountain flocks, which are said to be among the hardiest and meanest anywhere along the Serpentspine.

Let us put our mages and runesmiths on the task of finding a way to enchant the horns of our rams so they can do some real damage again.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is damestear</li><li>base production is at least 15</li><li>has building tradecompany</li></ul><li>unit type is tech_dwarven</li> | <li>custom tooltip = ramsteel_shock_2_replace</li><li>clear ramsteel fire shock buffs effect = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier ramsteel_shock_3 until otherwise removed</li> | ['Special' Feed](#ramsteel_feed_addition)<br /> |

It is through our hold that the flow of ramsteel and sheep products, along with myriad other goods from the Northern Pass, goes into the rest of the Serpentspine, and with that, our prosperity and growth is assured.* | <li>4147:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 7 yes</li></ul><li>production leader:</li><ul><li>trade goods is livestock</li></ul><li>production leader:</li><ul><li>trade goods is wool</li></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>country has this</li></ul> | <li>4147:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ramsteel_home_of_the_rangers_province</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add center of trade level = 2</li></ul> | [Into the Wilderness](#ramsteel_small_step)<br />[Reclaim Ramvault](#ramsteel_reclaim_ramvault)<br /> |

These caverns contain natural resources unexploited by the dwarves of old, but no longer. The ever hungry ramsteel industry demands more iron for the forges, and we must provide it.* | <li>dagrinrod 4 6 area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ramsteel_settlement_enthusiasm for 10 years</li><li>mithradhum area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>goblins bypass area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>broken dagger pass area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Ramsteel Weapons Research](#ramsteel_weapons_research)<br /> |

Our rangers have also discovered that they are more surefooted and less skittish than our Vale rams, especially around gunfire. We are at a crossroads - can we take advantage of the innate nature of the Gelkalis breed to retool our ram cavalry, or should we stick with what we know?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>innovativeness is at least 25</li><li>mil tech is at least 11</li></ul><li>army reformer is at least 2</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier ramsteel_gelkalis_buffs</li></ul> | <li>the event [Choice for our Ram Corps](../events/choice_for_our_ram_corps.md) happens</li> | [A Perfect Pairing](#ramsteel_mithril_ramsteel)<br />[The Gelkalis Breed](#ramsteel_gelkalis_breed)<br /> |

With the heyday of heavy cavalry is over, literal 'heavy' armor is increasingly relegated to the sidelines as maneuverability and ability to stop a stray bullet gains importance. As such, we must invest more heavily in all-mithril barding.

| <a name="ramsteel_mithril_ramsteel">A Perfect Pairing</a><br />*With both ramsteel and mithril production up and running, we can finally take advantage of the unique properties of both to complement each other for our armor. Mithril, of course, is much lighter and stronger than ramsteel, but is correspondingly much more difficult to create. As our ram cavalry is already smaller and lighter than horse based cavalry, our troops suffer in cavalry-cavalry confrontations, mass wise. We can fit mithril armor where strength is of more importance and other parts with ramsteel to break two rocks with one swing.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier hold_foundry</li><li>has province modifier  hold_foundry_2</li><li>has province modifier   magma_forge</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = ramsteel_perfect_pairing_trading_bonus</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has ROOT has trading bonus has trade goods is iron, and trading bonus has country has this:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier ramsteel_perfect_pairing_bonus_buff until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier ramsteel_perfect_pairing_buff until otherwise removed</li></ul></ul> | [Ramp Up Mithril Production](#ramsteel_mithril_production)<br />[Setzun Forges](#ramsteel_advanced_ramsteel_forge)<br /> |
