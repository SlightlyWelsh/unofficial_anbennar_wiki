They drove many of our kindred from their ancestral homes and even today, over four hundred years later, continue to desecrate Bulwar with their presence. They will be driven out.

Sadly, many of our brothers and sisters continue to languish under the rule of the Elven Yoke. Irrliam. Sareyand. Varamhar. Elizna.

| <a name="dartaxagerdim_destroy_irrliam">Destroy Irrliam</a><br />*Taelarios was the architect of the arch-heresy, professing an Elf as the incarnation of Surakel for the sake of his and his kind's own near-sighted political gains. Our people have suffered for centuries because of this unforgivable crime. Irrliam has become the wealthiest Sun Elven state of Bulwar since then, dominating the wealthy city of Brasan. That will not save them from the punishment that we shall lay upon them. Their existence is forfeit.* | <li>owns core province 595</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Irrliam</li></ul> | <li>595:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -2</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li><li>add devastation = 100</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>the event [Storming of Irrliam](../events/storming_of_irrliam.md) happens</li><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F24</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 120</li></ul> | [The Wars of Unification](#dartaxagerdim_wars_of_unification)<br /> |

The arch-heretics and enemies of a free Bulwar have been driven into the sea from whence they came. Now, we stand as a preeminent power in Bulwar, and yet, many of our brothers and sisters in faith and blood continue to languish under the rule of the misguided.

| <a name="dartaxagerdim_noble_generals">Companions of Dartaxes</a><br />*Dartaxes was once a loyal knight and retainer to the Elven rulers of Birzartanšes, until the decades of devastation lifted the veil from his eyes and showed how much suffering the Sun Elves had brought to Bulwar. When he rose in revolt, it was his fellow human nobles and officers whose loyalty and trust he had garnered in war that joined his banner, forming a core group of followers that would ensure the survival of their rebellion.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_nobles_officer_corp</li><li>num of estate privileges:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier dartaxagerdim_noble_officers for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="dartaxagerdim_humble_bastard">Humble the Bastard</a><br />*Deggarrion was the bastard son of the Elven Akal of Baharkand who was slain by the Marblehead Goblins. Since the fall of his family, he has ruled a state to our west, a land bountiful in gold and jewels, and has dreams of bringing Baharšes under his own rule.

In turn, we have offered them a haven of safety for them and their descendants to practice their magic freely - so long as they remain loyal to the Akal.

| <a name="dartaxagerdim_curb_sebhuliam">Curb the Sebhuliam</a><br />*The Sebhuliam have slowly gained a large amount of influence in our Akalate. As the forefront of our armies, their partisans have gained influential positions outside of our military, some even rising to serve as trusted ministers and confidants to the Akal themselves. However, their rivalry with the nobility has only been exacerbated with their rising star. While the nobility have proven their loyalty to us, the Sebhuliam's ambitions may one day rise to challenge the authority of the Akal himself, which can not be allowed for the stability of the realm. Removing them, however, will be a difficult and costly task.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 80</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>influence is at least 60</li></ul></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = noble_sebhuliam_rivalry_III</li><li>country gets the modifier dartaxagerdim_curbing_sebhuliam for 10 years</li><li>the event [The Sebhuliam Revolt](../events/the_sebhuliam_revolt.md) happens</li> | [The Sacking of Sareyand](#dartaxagerdim_the_sacking_of_sareyand)<br /> |

| <a name="dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi">The Genie Palace</a><br />*After years of searching the countryside and a dozen failed digs, our archaeologists have finally found what we were looking for: an ancient site that seems to be from the period of Djinn Sultanates! What's more, while it initially seemed to be a small site, that was only the tip of a massive palace underground complex, apparently once housing genies hiding from Brasan the Emancipator and the human genie-binders he taught. Though we have only reached the precipice, our magi have started carefully dismantling the defensive magic of the place, and learning the long forgotten arts of genie magic along the way.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>owns core province 658</li><li>658:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_mages_reduced_research_regulations</li> | <li>658:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>658:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = university</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = court_mage</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>culture = ROOT</li><li>religion = ROOT</li><li>female = yes</li></ul> | [Establish Magi Tower](#dartaxagerdim_establish_magi_sanctuary)<br /> |
| <a name="dartaxagerdim_works_prayer">Works and Prayer</a><br />*The combination of Sebhuliam preaching and the increasingly large presence of mages in our capital has led to a unique relationship between the two factions. Though different on the surface, both the Sebhuliam and the szal-Fazil are dedicated to the restoration of the old Bahari and Bulwari traditions lost to time and see our Akalate as the best chance for their cause. Their mutual support of our regime has energized the local populace, leading to increased prosperity in our capital.* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Golden Century"</li></ul><li>has holy order trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = dartaxagerdim_capital_prod</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [In Worship of Surakel](#dartaxagerdim_worship_surakel)<br />[The Genie Palace](#dartaxagerdim_palace_of_magi)<br /> |

Crafted from simple bronze, its surface is inscribed with old runes that predate even our oldest sources on the Bulwari cuneiform. Held within the Akal's grip, the cool metal thrums with life, and the wind whispers into his ear.

| <a name="dartaxagerdim_codify_religion">Codifying the Religion</a><br />*Dartaxes secured the allegiance with the Sebhuliam under the condition that his Akalte would expand the message of Harrum and his followers across all of Bulwar, a monumental task as the Old Sun Cult had always been a wide umbrella of pre-Jaherian traditions. But, with the aid of many influential Sebhuliam missionaries and ministers, the message of the Sebhuliam could be adjusted and made universal to all the worshippers of Surakel.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_church_enforced_one_faith</li> | <li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>share = -15</li></ul><li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_burghers</li><li>share = -15</li></ul><li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>share = 25</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = inquisitor</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.50</li><li>culture = bahari</li><li>name = "Ashuru szel-Harrumaz"</li></ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li> |  |

We are the bearers of Surakel's Light when the Darkness is at its most powerful. If we are to unite Baharšes under our rule, we must be the sword and shield of the faithful.* | <li>is defender of faith</li> | <li>country gets the modifier dartaxagerdim_missionary_cost for 15 years</li> | [Codifying the Religion](#dartaxagerdim_codify_religion)<br /> |

For years they have defended the faithful from their mountain redoubts within the Kuzak Mountain range. Now that we have united the region, it is time to reorganize the Sebhuliam into a fighting force to liberate Baharšes.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Golden Century"</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has holy order trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_dartax_sebhuliam</li></ul> | [In Worship of Surakel](#dartaxagerdim_worship_surakel)<br /> |

Borne from the increased cooperation and acceptance of the Sebhuliam's message by the Magi, the Scorch Priests are zealous, fanatic, and immensely lethal. These masters of Evocation magic bring the inferno, and leave only ash in their wake.

The royal family, the house of szal-Forramaz, would have absolute authority over all temporal matters - the nobles, the merchants, and all other secular aspects of the realm. The house of szal-Hamuranz, referred to as the Szalmušar, the Blood of the Founder, would command complete control of the state's religious apparatus as well as ensuring the loyalty of the fanatic Sebhuliam.* | <li>prestige is at least 90</li><li>legitimacy is at least 90</li><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>the event [The Szalmusar](../events/the_szalmusar.md) happens</li> | [The Scorch Priests](#dartaxagerdim_scorch_priests)<br /> |
