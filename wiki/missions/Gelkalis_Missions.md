| <a name="F26_goat_wool_weaving">Goat Wool Weaving</a><br />*While our shepherds and herds have started to recover, much more needs to be done in order to restore our textile industry. Many experienced weavers have died during the Decades of Devastation and many more have gone bankrupt in the chaos that followed. Today many weaver guild halls either lie empty or have barely a third of the members they had 40 years ago. Rejuvenating our wool trade will require a significant investment, both in terms of funding as well as new infrastructure.* | <li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is wool</li><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = gelkalis_goat_wool_weaving_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is wool, and  has base production is 4, and  has production building trigger is yes, and does not have building is textile:</li><ul><li>add building = textile</li></ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is wool, and  has base production is 4, and  has production building trigger is yes, and does not have building is textile:</li><ul><li>add building = textile</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -400</li> | [Restore the Pastures](#F26_restore_the_pastures)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_elven_tapestry">Elven Tapestry</a><br />*Of all the products made of gelkar wool, no single thing is of higher value than the Sarmadu, the flying carpets. Weaved from only the finest of our year´s wool production, these carpets are patterned with embroidery of a special thread, which is created by coloring the thread in a suspension of several secret ingredients and damestear dust, creating wool shimmering in the iridescent teal blue of damestear. These patterns give the Sarmadu their unique looks and ability to be enchanted to glide through the sky. Mages, both Bulwari and foreign, see these carpets as the pinnacle of personal transportation and are known to pay astronomical sums for such a rug. Despite the huge demand, our production has remained small, the production of flying carpets being a closely guarded secret by the sun elven monasteries and mage guilds. This is a waste! We should endeavour to coax the secrets out of them and give us leave to disseminate the secrets of the trade between the different elven weaver guilds, thereby ensuring an increase of production to at least partially satisfy the demand.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>primary culture is sun_elf</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture is sun_elf</li><li>development is at least 20</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>665:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>665:</li><ul><li>province trade power is at least 20</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>665:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_flying_carpets</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>664:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>653:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>669:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Goat Wool Weaving](#F26_goat_wool_weaving)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_iron_star_over_the_moon">Iron Star over the Moon</a><br />*The Kuz mountain range, which comprises the Western most extension of the harpy hills, has long been the core domain of our former overlord of Birsatanses. However, the once mighty kingdom has never recovered from the decades of devastation, and even the ousting of king Arantir by his ambitious and cunning daughter Keladora was not enough to arrest their decay. With Birsartansbar a shadow of its former self, the people have been clamoring for a new protector. The time has come to fully unite the Harpy Hills under the rule of the iron star.* | <li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_state_investment</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> | [Secure the Western Flank](#F26_secure_the_western_flank)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_unite_our_people">Unite Our People</a><br />*The humans of the Southern Kuz mountain range have long lived lives not too dissimilar from our own people. However, they are also stubborn and proud people that themselves closer to the Bahari of the lowlands than to us. Over the centuries dozens of grievances have built up between our people. Now the time to put an end to all this has come. They need to realize that they have more in common with us, Gelkar, than any low landers. In order to do this, Gelkar colonies will be built in suitable empty valleys, and rebellious priests are to be replaced with more supportive clergy. Soon all humans of the Mountains of the Moon will think of themselves as Gelkar.* | <li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>num of times improved by owner is at least 5</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>change culture = gelkar</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_rivalry_ended</li><li>duration = 10950</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = artist</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = gelkar</li><li>religion = ROOT</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [Iron Star over the Moon](#F26_iron_star_over_the_moon)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_proto_industrial_textile_production">Early Textile Industrialism</a><br />*The demand for Gelkar wool and wool products seems to know no bounds. Despite running themselves and their employees ragged, our weaver guilds are not able to meet domestic and foreign demand using traditional working methods. Luckily, constraints breed innovation, and over the years across the country myriads of small improvements have been made by different weavers. The minister of industries proposes we collect and evaluate the most successful innovations and create a standardized template for large scale production facilities. This could herald a new age in textile production.* | <li>665:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>has institution global_trade</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>province group is gelkalis_core_zone</li><li>has building textile</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>gelkalis core zone textile:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_proto_industrial_waving</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Great Haven](#F26_the_great_haven)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_the_power_of_water">The Power of Water</a><br />*With the previous success of our standardized large-scale manufactories and the generous rewards given out to anyone contributing significant improvements, more and more of our subjects have sent in letters with ideas or appeared at our audiences to plead their case. While potentially quite advantageous for us in the long run, this has slowed down audiences quite considerably, and less time can be used to hear other petitions brought forward by our subjects. \n\nTo lighten the workload of the court in Gelkalis our ministers have proposed the establishment of technical colleges in our most important industrial towns. These schools would serve as sites where proposals could be heard by professionals and be evaluated based on the local situation, as well as serve to educate a new generation of civil engineers. Our ministers have also proposed a head of the technical colleges, Magnus Trueanvil, an engineer known as a pioneer for novel uses of water power.* | <li>gelkalis core zone textile:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has building university</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>654:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building trade_depot</li><li>has building  stock_exchange</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>654:</li><ul><li>province trade power is at least 25</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building trade_depot</li><li>has building  stock_exchange</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>gelkalis core zone textile:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = gelkalis_proto_industrial_waving</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_industrial_waving</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Early Textile Industrialism](#F26_proto_industrial_textile_production)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_the_ashen_terrace">The Ashen Terrace</a><br />*Based on Magnus Trueanvil´s recommendation we have ordered the construction of a series of dams along the rivers running through the canyons and valleys of our kingdom. This had the side effect of creating a series of reservoirs throughout our kingdom. Recently our minister of agriculture has been approached by a group of villagers from the villages along the Buranun, as well as the head of our technical colleges, Sharaf szal-Aban. Having visited the villages, while overseeing the construction of the dams along the Buranun, he has noticed the high quality of the surrounding volcano of Gor Burad. It would be great farm land, if it weren't so dry. He therefore proposes a new irrigation system, which links our Buranun reservoirs to the Gor Burad terraces, allowing us to turn this previously barely usable ashen waste into the most fertile farmland in the entire nation.* | <li>treasury is at least 2000</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>672:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add treasury = -2000</li><li>672:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = grain</li><li>add building = soldier_households</li><li>remove province modifier = gelkalis_industrial_waving</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_breadbasket_of_the_mountains</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Power of Water](#F26_the_power_of_water)<br /> |

| <a name="F26_restore_the_pastures">Restore the Pastures</a><br />*Having liberated our old holdings from the harsh rule of the Queendom, we have found them in a sad state. Most villages are depopulated, the fields lay fallow and the pastures are empty of goats and shepherds. Worst of all, the venerable old guild house of the weavers guild in hranapas burned down during one of the harpies´ hunt for “husbands''. This sorry state needs to be remedied immediately. People that have fled from harpy tyranny will be offered incentives to repopulate the villages, select breeding pairs of goats will be moved West to start new herds and most important of all, the hranapas weaver guild will be refounded and their old guild house restored using royal funds. The dark night is over, these lands will bask in the light of Surakel and the Iron Star once again.* | <li>668:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 3</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>668:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 3</li></ul><li>If every owned province has trade goods is wool:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_flocks_returned</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul> | [Freedom for Our Brethren](#F26_freedom_for_our_brethren)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_the_citadels_design">The Citadels' Design</a><br />*While our cities have always been considered fortified, the limitations of our mountainous homelands have prevented us from creating truly massive fortifications like some cities in the flat lands and along the coast possess. However, this might be about to change. A group of military engineers has recently returned from our wars against the Queendom. While fighting the harpies they have become impressed with the engineering of some of the large Harpy dwellings, which are directly built onto and into the steepest mountain sides. They believe that, by making use of some of the same principles used by our foes and some application of minor enchantment magic, we could mirror the effect, but with buildings of stone and brick. They have even gone so far as to propose a new plan for fortified cities built in this fashion. They call their proposal a cliff citadel, and are confident they can turn our cities into fortresses which can stand up to any foe. All they require is our support as monarch… and a bit of funding of course.* | <li>665:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>Have an advisor of type fortification_expert</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>665:</li><ul><li>gelkalis build cliff citadel = yes</li></ul> | [Restore the Pastures](#F26_restore_the_pastures)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_gelkar_fashion">Gelkar Fashion</a><br />*During the first Phoenix Empire Gelkar fashion was sold throughout the Empire. Nowadays, while the quality of our wool and cloth is still well known, foreigners mostly buy it as raw material to sell it to their tailors, who manufacture clothing in their home country´s style. While there is significant money in the textile trade, it pales in comparison to the clothing trade. We should therefore strive to introduce Gelkar style clothing to our allied courts via our diplomats. This would require both increasing our diplomatic standing as well as sending out magnificent clothing as gifts for our allies.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is cotton</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 5</li></ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>diplomatic reputation is at least 2</li><li>prestige is at least 30</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>add years of income = 1</li><li>add stability = 1</li><li>country gets the modifier gelkalis_fashion for 15 years</li> | [Elven Tapestry](#F26_elven_tapestry)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_secure_the_western_flank">Secure the Western Flank</a><br />*While we have secured our eastern flank against the harpies, we must not forget the dangers that lurk in towards the sunset. The goblin tribe of Grey Sheep has taken over the valuable pastures and mines around Lake Nasratu. And in Akal-Uak, the embers of heresy and rebellion remain. If we are to know true peace, we need to protect our Western flank as well. Only by controlling all the surrounding mountain ranges will our homeland be able to prosper in peace.* | <li>ur monkande area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>kuzak area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Organize the Militias](#F26_organize_the_militias)<br /> |

Fewer than 100 would return. Our abilities as light infantry, honed by centuries of fighting in the rugged terrain of mountains, proved useless against Baharkandi heavy horse on the wide floodplains of Aqatbahar. With our soldiers being slaughtered in the West, our enemies to our east saw their chance and invaded, almost bringing Gelkalis to its knees. Now the time for revenge has come. The wrongs of the past will be avenged. The Bahari will water our soldiers´ graves with their blood.* | <li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [A Triumphal Entrance](../events/a_triumphal_entrance.md) happens</li> | [Secure the Western Flank](#F26_secure_the_western_flank)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_the_great_haven">The Great Haven</a><br />*With the conquest of Aqatbar we have taken control of a large and once prosperous trading port. However, our people have no experience as seafaring merchants, and the local Bahari merchants are rather hesitant to work together with what they view as their foreign oppressors. Still, there might be another option. The merchants of the port-hold of Ovdal Tungr have been traveling the Divenhal Sea since before the elves came to our shores. If we can convince a number of their trading houses to open branches in Aqatbar, this might give us a cooperative merchant class, which, together with some targeted investments, could return Aqatbar to former glory.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F23:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul></ul><li>526:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>536:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>536:</li><ul><li>province trade power is at least 25</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>536:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_trade_port</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Last Charge](#F26_the_last_charge)<br />[Jorkand Lake Development Plan](#F26_jorkand_lake_development_plan)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_iron_star_foundaries">Iron Star Foundaries</a><br />*The quality of our wool is known far and wide, but it isn't the only riches our mountains have to offer. The mountains around Asmangol and Lake Jorkad are rich in iron ore. Our people have been mining these mountains for centuries, turning the ore brought up into Surakel´s light into iron of a quality high enough to attract the interest of dwarven merchants. However, during the decades of devastation the mines were abandoned, and the ironworks closed down. Now the time has come to reopen the mines and stoke the flames. With the introduction of new mining and smelting technologies, our steel will soon be counted among the best in the world once again.* | <li>655:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>678:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>661:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>619:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>655:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_iron_star_industry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>678:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_iron_star_industry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>619:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_iron_star_industry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>661:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_iron_star_industry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Great Haven](#F26_the_great_haven)<br /> |
| <a name="F26_shining_topaz">Shining Topaz</a><br />*Since time immemorial the people of Bulwar have praised one kind of gem above any other: the Surbraquari (“Drops of the Sun”), topazes of magnificent quality enchanted with dwarven runic magic to shine with the light of the sun. While in times of old created exclusively in the holds of the seghbandal, a small group of dwarven craftsmen has settled down in the valley now called Toiabazi, plying their trade as gem carvers from there since time immemorial, nearly forgotten except by gem traders. However, in recent years their small community has garnered significant interest from parts of Gelkar society. With the advancement of artificery, our inventors have been looking for alternatives to Damestear, and believe that they have found a suitable substitute with the Surbraquari.\n\nAs a result, they have been pushing for an expansion in production, yet the craftsmen would require an immense influx of investments in order to speed up and expand such a time consuming and complicated process.\n\nOnly the crown could provide the kind of resources needed. \n\nThe Sun itself shall power our artifice and bring Gelkalis a new age of innovation and prosperity.* | <li>656:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 15</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has building university</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul><li>Have an advisor of type artist</li><li>has estate estate_artificers</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has building university</li><li>has building  mage_tower</li></ul> | <li>656:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_gemstone_of_surakel</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>If has 536 has province modifier is aqatbar gnome quarter:</li><ul><li>add gnomish minority size effect = yes</li></ul></ul><li>mission reward artifice points 3 = yes</li> | [Iron Star Foundaries](#F26_iron_star_foundaries)<br />[Into the Mountain](#F26_into_the_mountain)<br /> |

Using centuries old techniques, new technologies, harpy builders, and the occasional application of magic, we are able to turn naked mountain walls into terraces bustling with life. With the recent explosion of our population, many of our cities are in desperate need of expansion, both in terms of living quarters and infrastructure. Given our returned prosperity, we should not contend ourselves with the expansion of the old, but instead we should build bigger and better than ever before. Let us raise new monuments to the glory of our people, new factories to employ them, and new schools to teach them. Our cities will reflect Surakel´s light, shimmering like jewels on a crown from their lofty mountain peaks.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is gelkalis_cities_of_the_mountain_tooltip</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier gelkalis_cliff_citadel_2</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has building university</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = gelkalis_cities_of_the_mountain_2_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bulwar superregion has province modifier is gelkalis cliff citadel 2:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = gelkalis_cliff_citadel_2</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_cliff_citadel_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>set country flag [gelkalis_citadel_lv_3](../flags/gelkalis_citadel_lv_3.md)</li> | [Shining Topaz](#F26_shining_topaz)<br />[The Power of Water](#F26_the_power_of_water)<br /> |

| <a name="F26_freedom_for_our_brethren">Freedom for Our Brethren</a><br />*These days ours is a small, poor and desolate land. Yet this was not always the case. A mere generation ago our land was prosperous. Under the benign neglect by the sun elven court in Birsartansbar, our nation was free to grow and develop as we saw fit. The bazaars of Gelkalis and the other cities were brimming with merchants from as far away as Lorent seeking our wool, cloth and steel. Yet it could not last, as nothing in Surakel´s light can. The sun elves are still bickering over Jaher´s Empire like estranged siblings over a rich inheritance and once again those squabbles ended in bloodshed. When our overlords declared war on Baharkand we answered as loyal bannermen. 15000 axes marched down from the mountains. Fewer than a 100 returned home. Sensing our weakness the harpies came down from their perches driving us out of our Eastern holdings. Only the mighty walls of Gelkalis and the Iron Star palace prevented our annihilation. Some might say that we are merely stalling the inevitable, that the fate of the Gelkar is to be plaything of the powers around us, to be snuffed out at their pleasure, but this is a folly. We Gelkar have endured worse and we are as steadfast as the mountains we call home. I, Uman the First szel-Gelkalis, will not merely allow my people to despair in these dark hours. Like Surakel we will rise again and return to our former glory. And Surakel willing, far more than that….* | <li>668:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>669:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>671:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>harpylen area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>frenyantlen area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>invaders pass area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier gelkalis_reclaimer_army for 20 years</li> |  |

While it is easy enough for small groups of experienced Gelkar rangers to live off the land, this is not possible whenever we draw together large forces. Other nations use oxen and mules to carry supplies, but these animals are poorly suited to the mountains we call home. Instead our quartermasters have come forward with a different solution. By crossbreeding our goats with the wild mufflons of the Harpy Hills we should be able to create a new breed of goat that is larger and able to carry considerable weight over long distances, and, should the situation turn dire, could make for extra rations. While requiring significant investment, this might be the solution to our supply problem.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is livestock</li><li>base manpower is at least 4</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier gelkalis_goat_logistic_1 until otherwise removed</li> | [Restore the Pastures](#F26_restore_the_pastures)<br />[Secure the Valleys](#F26_secure_the_valleys)<br /> |

Instead, we Gelkar defend ourselves like we have done since the dawn of our people. Since time immemorial, whenever some stranger has tried to conquer our lands by force, it was the common people that defended our lands. Sheperds, miners, and weavers, taking up simple weapons and harrying the enemy in a relentless guerilla campaign until they flee our mountains in terror. These tactics have been instrumental in our survival as a people and nation. With the passing of the decades, we think the time has come to formalize this system. The nabarsad system will organize these ragtag mountain warriors into a decentralized guerilla defense force with local chains of command based around preplanned sectors. This will allow them to make swift decisions based on the surrounding area, rather than wait for central command or fall into chaos with every village fighting its own miniature war.* | <li>gelkalis core zone:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>manpower is at least 10</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>Have an advisor of type army_reformer</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army tradition is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>gelkalis core zone:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_unconquerable_land_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>ur monkande area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>kuzak area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Fortify the Pass](#F26_fortify_the_pass)<br />[Resettle the Valleys](#F26_resettle_the_valleys)<br /> |

Too many of our winged subjects still live in primitive cliff dwellings like their ancestors have done for centuries. If they are to share our prosperity we need to help them modernize and give them opportunities to share in our wealth. Recently, one of our merchants has approached us with a proposal. The wealthy merchant Idris  has started to employ harpies in his weaving shops at the urging of his harpy wife. To his great delight they have proven greatly suited to the task, quickly producing fabrics of high quality and with new and unfamiliar patterns based on harpy designs. These fabrics have become all the rage among the wealthy of Gelkalis, and based on their huge success, his wife, Selussa, has drawn up plans for weaving shops optimized for use by harpy workers. They have approached us, asking for the crown´s blessing and offering us a share of the business, for a modest investment into the venture.

Only through the clever employ of water and gravity can the lush terrace farms of the Harpy Hills prosper. Yet setting up these systems in new areas is a challenging and expensive task. As a result, many of our more recently required lands still lack these systems. Such is also the case for the lands around the sapphire expanse of Lake Jorkad. However, some steps have been made to change this. A local engineer , Abella szal-Duzan, has managed to unify a series of local human villages and harpy communities to fund the construction of irrigation systems around Lake Jorkad. With the first promising steps completed, he has approached the court with an expensive plan for the development of the lake shore, which would turn it into a new economic powerbase for our nation.* | <li>jorkad lake area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>Have an advisor of type natural_scientist</li> | <li>jorkad lake area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_jorkad_lake_eco_area</li><li>duration = 10950</li></ul></ul> | [Harpy Weavers](#F26_harpy_weavers)<br /> |

With ever larger walls and ramparts to withstand the destructive power of modern artillery and artifice, ever more masons and soldiers to maintain and garrison them are required, which in turn puts a strain on the amount of living and storage space available to hold the people and the supplies which keep them fed and their guns firing. Given that we cannot go wider or higher, our only option remains to go deeper. While we will never manage to challenge the dwarves in this regard, our military engineers are convinced to achieve similar robust underground rooms with a combination of conventional engineering and limited application of artifice. This will allow us to move our powder storage, food stores, and living quarters into the mountain, protecting them from enemy artillery and allowing us to further extend our defensive works.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 7</li><li>has province modifier gelkalis_cliff_citadel_1</li><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has building training_fields</li><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li></ul><li>fortification expert is at least 3</li> | <li>custom tooltip = gelkalis_into_the_mountain_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bulwar superregion has province modifier is gelkalis cliff citadel 1:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = gelkalis_cliff_citadel_1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_cliff_citadel_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>set country flag [gelkalis_citadel_lv_2](../flags/gelkalis_citadel_lv_2.md)</li> | [Shield over the Plains](#F26_shield_over_the_plains)<br />[The Great Haven](#F26_the_great_haven)<br /> |

Even the smaller calibers are ill-suited for the broken terrain of our nation. They have also proven too slow and cumbersome to be useful in the asymmetric warfare employed by the nabashar militias. As a result, cannons have only been imported in limited numbers to be used in static emplacements along the walls of our cliff citadels.\n\nNow our artificers and engineers seem to have come up with a solution to our artillery problem. By mounting small caliber, rifled guns on some of the strongest goats from our logistics division and pairing them with shepherds trained in the art of gunnery, they have created a system which allows us to deploy artillery across rugged terrain and deliver accurate volleys from unexpected angles.\n\nWhile the first trials have been quite successful, the training and equipment of these new units takes a fair bit of time. Our engineers have proposed the creation of new gun factories and gunnery schools in order to turn these new units, colloquially referred to as Thunderhorns, into an equal branch of the nabashar regiments.* | <li>num of artillery is at least 20</li><li>monthly mil is at least 12</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Rule Britannia"</li></ul><li>innovativeness is at least 30</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>mil power is at least 800</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has building training_fields</li></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = gelkalis_goat_logistic_1</li><li>country gets the modifier gelkalis_goat_logistic_2 until otherwise removed</li> | [Iron Star Foundaries](#F26_iron_star_foundaries)<br /> |

Special grazing groups will be set aside for military use, with adjunct sites that allow the rapid repacking of supplies from tired to fresh pack goats. To further ease this repacking they have also come up with a new standardized packing system comprised of optimized crates and pouches.

Edicts by local governors and temples have not brought the expected success.\n\nHowever, some reports from the high valleys are filling the royal council with optimism. \n\nBeing a shepherd, while an old and noble occupation, has always been a hard, dangerous, and lonely affair. The young men and women often spent months in the high valleys alone, tending to the flocks until far into the night, always wary of the dangers of wolves, harpy raids, and sudden mountain storms. Spending so much time alone, one hardly wonders why so many Gelkar poems speak so highly of the dedication of the shepherds and their deep love for their goats. Yet while one may love their work and charges, it is rarely enough for a happy life by itself.\n\nWhile harpies have often targeted isolated shepherds in their raids in ages past, it appears that some younger harpies have chosen to adjust their traditions with the new circumstances. Instead of swooping down from the skies to carry off any unwary shepherds, they have instead taken to approaching them in a peaceful manner, bringing them supplies and news of the outside world, and if the shepherd proves interesting and to the harpy´s liking, offers of companionship are made. Some couples resulting from such - at first temporary - unions have even proceeded to come down from the high valleys as husband and wife, integrating harpies into Gelkar families as secondary wives. This has led to quite the change in perception of the shepherding profession in some regions, and more and more young men are signing up as shepherds for at least a season or two in the hopes of experiencing this new pastoral love. \n\nThis shift in traditions needs to be supported by the government as much as possible. Our harpy subjects need to find new ways to procreate without the old traditions of raiding for husbands, and replacing this old tradition with a new system that is more accepted by the humans of Gelkalis would go a long way to integrate our harpy and human subjects with one another.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is gelkalis_sheppards_and_harpies_2_tooltip</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is firanyan_harpy</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is firanyan_harpy</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is firanyan_harpy</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is gelkalis_sheppards_and_harpies_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [gelkalis_won_civil_war](../flags/gelkalis_won_civil_war.md)</li></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = gelkalis_military_occupation</li><li>If every owned province has province modifier is gelkalis disrupted eco:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = gelkalis_disrupted_eco</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier gelkalis_pastoral_love for 30 years</li><li>gelkalis core zone:</li><ul><li>add harpy minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Resettle the Valleys](#F26_resettle_the_valleys)<br />[Fortify the Pass](#F26_fortify_the_pass)<br />[The All-Forgiving Light](#F26_the_allforgiving_light)<br /> |

As their armaments will be light and their main duties will be out of active combat, few will protest against such a use of our subjects.\n\nThe second unit, the Umugallu ( “Cliff fiends”) will be a smaller force, only recruited from the most loyal flocks.

This is achieved by setting a series of small damestear gems into the blanks, which contain an attraction enchantment. As the enchantment starts, the blanks are raised through the attractive force exerted by the keystones at each side of the bridge. Stopping that enchantment lets the panels collapse down again.\n\nWhile the proposal is expensive, both our magical and natural engineers are convinced the proposal is doable and would allow Gelkar armies and caravans to move through the hills at unmatched speeds.* | <li>gelkalis core zone:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 55</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 2000</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -2000</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>gelkalis core zone:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = gelkalis_enchanted_bridges</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Westward Wall](#F26_westward_wall)<br /> |

Indeed, Gelkar products have found quite the market abroad; the amount of wares moved through Aqatbar is increasing each year. This has recently caused some concern among our court. While the city has become a pillar of our national economy, it lies at the periphery of Gelkar power, unprotected by a formidable cliff citadel as most of our largest cities are.

With these new fortifications in place, Aqatbar will be all but unassailable.* | <li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>530:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>534:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>539:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>544:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>530:</li><ul><li>gelkalis build cliff citadel = yes</li></ul><li>534:</li><ul><li>gelkalis build cliff citadel = yes</li></ul><li>539:</li><ul><li>gelkalis build cliff citadel = yes</li></ul><li>544:</li><ul><li>gelkalis build cliff citadel = yes</li></ul><li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Shield over the Plains](#F26_shield_over_the_plains)<br /> |

The greatest servant of the malevolent dark.\n\nThose who cause it  are fully committed to fight against Surakel in the struggle, and those who give into it fail in their duty towards Him.\n\nFrom time immemorial, the harpies have committed themselves to the malevolent dark by raiding our lands and bringing despair to our people. Yet it is known that harpies are not committed by nature to this behavior. If we can show them the love and joy of the light of surakel, maybe we can truly bring them to our side, so that none of our brothers may feel desperation ever again.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is gelkalis_the_allforgiving_light_tooltip</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is firanyan_harpy</li></ul><li>has owner religion</li></ul></ul></ul><li>accepted culture is firanyan_harpy</li> | <li>add stability = 2</li><li>large increase of harpy tolerance effect = yes</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = army_organiser</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = firanyan_harpy</li><li>religion = ROOT</li><li>female = yes</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [March to the Lake](#F26_march_to_the_lake)<br /> |

The now integrated elves excel in archery, being a threat to everything our foes could throw against us. The areas around our cliff citadels are now death zones, and the elven speed significantly raised the threat posed by our skirmishers. They can get into unthinkable positions, get off impossible shots with insane precision, and are gone before our enemies can even think where to look for them.

With every campaign our nation grew as they showed what they were capable of, and every time we learned what we could do to improve our army both in offensiveness as well as in defensiveness.
