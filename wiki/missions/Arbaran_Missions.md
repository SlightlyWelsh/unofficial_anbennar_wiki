| <a name="A46_horsemeat_delicacies">Horsemeat Delicacies</a><br />*The Crodamic peoples that used to inhabit the western portion of our realm have long since assimilated into Arbarani culture, however, some of their cultural particularities were kept and are still practiced today. One of these is the consumption of horsemeat, which some theorise may have originated in Crodamic rivalries with the centaurs that used to inhabit Escann before Castan II Beastbane drove them out. This practice is looked down upon in disgust by many elsewhere in Cannor, however.\n\nThe fools simply don't know what good food is. They may not want to buy our horsemeat pies now, but with a bit of clever rebranding, we can sell it as an exotic meat that will make everyone's mouths water.* | <li>250:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul><li>334:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>245:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "arbaran_horsemeat_trade" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A46_retain_escanni_refugees">Retain Escanni Refugees</a><br />*Our realm was hit hard by the waves of refugees coming from Escann in the wake of the Greentide, and Freecestir has served as one of the main stopping points for refugees making their way West to Lencenor, and lately also for Adventurers and settlers returning to Escann. With such a large amount of people passing through our lands, we only need to provide the right incentives to convince at least some of them to stay and help grow our great realm.* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>245:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>245:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "arbaran_greentide_refugees" for 25 years</li> | [Horsemeat Delicacies](#A46_horsemeat_delicacies)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_freecestir">Freecestir</a><br />*Freecestir (Cestir meaning camp or campground in Elven) has been a settlement of great importance ever since its pivotal role in the defeat of the Sorcerer-King. Lying at the crossroads between Escann and the rest of Cannor, it has served as a mustering ground for armies and adventurers in the past, and now it again serves as the main stopping point for adventurers seeking to gain glory in Escann and beyond.\n\nThis has helped the settlement grow into a bustling metropolis, a centre of commerce to rival even Damescrown, far overshadowing our current capital in Arbaran. Mercenaries fill the taverns, looking for new contracts, traders constantly pass through the city carrying Gawedi furs, Telgeiran weaponry or perhaps a shipment of Orcish slaves from Escann. If we are to compete with our beloved cousins in Damescrown, we must move our capital to Freecestir.* | <li>245:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>245:</li><ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul> | <li>245:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = arbaran_freecestir_trade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>move capital effect = yes</li></ul><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add adm power = 100</li> | [Retain Escanni Refugees](#A46_retain_escanni_refugees)<br />[Fortify Calascandar](#A46_fortify_calascandar)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_clstc_workshops">CLSTC Workshops</a><br />*The artisanry of the CLSTC is of the highest quality. We cannot dominate the markets though if the quantity produced cannot meet market demand. If we grant the Company more workshops, we will increase production of artisan goods greatly and as such we will earn a lot more in sales. After all, quantity is a quality all in its own.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier arbaran_clstc_goods for 25 years</li><li>add mercantilism = 3</li> | [Freecestir](#A46_freecestir)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_challenging_damescrown_clstc">Challenging Damescrown</a><br />*Arbaran's branch of the CLSTC faces a great issue, the issue of branding. When most people think of the Company, they think of the high-quality glassware, jewellery or other goods... But they also think of Damescrown. Damescrown, the greatest trade hub in all of Cannor, second only perhaps to Anbennc√≥st.\n\nThey forget about Calascandar, the place the company was founded, about Arbaran or Freecestir. This must change. Arbaran's CLSTC must become the more influential branch, if we want to attain the glory that we are owed on the world stage.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>mercantilism is at least 20</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is arbaran_level_2_trade_center_in_damescrown_tt</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 234</li><li>any trade node member province:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 234</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Damescrown</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier arbaran_clstc_loyalty until otherwise removed</li><li>set global flag [arbaran_influencing_damescrown](../flags/arbaran_influencing_damescrown.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = arbaran_damescrown_elections_tt</li> | [CLSTC Workshops](#A46_clstc_workshops)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_hostile_takeover">Hostile Takeover</a><br />*It took many years of scheming, purchasing of shares and marketing, but we are finally in a position where Arbaran's branch of the CLSTC nearly has a controlling interest in Damescrown. It will only take a little bit more, and we shall have all of Damescrown in our pocket.\n\nNo more Crownsman meddling, no more profits going to the wrong hands; we, the house Silcalas of Arbaran, will be the only ones who decide what happens with the CLSTC, now and forever.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A25:</li><ul><li>orangists are in power</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Damescrown</li></ul><li>owns 234</li></ul></ul><li>234:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is A25:</li><ul><li>the event [Just an Ordinary Business Meeting](../events/just_an_ordinary_business_meeting.md) happens</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li></ul><li>remove country modifier = arbaran_clstc_loyalty</li><li>country gets the modifier arbaran_clstc_loyalty_2 until otherwise removed</li> | [Challenging Damescrown](#A46_challenging_damescrown_clstc)<br /> |

| <a name="A46_riches_of_the_north">Riches of the North</a><br />*The lands formerly occupied by Gawed are rather sparsely populated and their great natural wealth is under-utilised. With the help of local magnates and more local investment, we can better exploit the region's resources.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is westmounts_area</li><li>area  is gawed_area</li><li>area   is south_alen_area</li><li>area    is alenic_expanse_area</li><li>area     is alenvord_area</li><li>area      is balvord_area</li><li>area       is jonsway_area</li></ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>has institution manufactories</li> | <li>westmounts area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>gawed area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>south alen area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>alenic expanse area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>alenvord area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>balvord area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>jonsway area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>arbaran area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>golden plains area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>cestir area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul> | [Integrate the Magnates](#A46_integrate_the_magnates)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_fueling_the_industry">Fueling the Industry</a><br />*The Alenic Reach is extremely rich in coal reserves. Coal has been used as a fuel to keep people warm for thousands of years here, but with recent advances in technology, we can start extracting it in great amounts and use it as a fuel far more efficient than wood, which will help our growing industry.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>base production is at least 12</li><li>has building furnace</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 100</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier arbaran_industrial_revolution for 25 years</li><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li> | [Riches of the North](#A46_riches_of_the_north)<br />[Northern CLSTC](#A46_northern_clstc)<br /> |

| <a name="A46_postwar_mobilization">Post-War Mobilization</a><br />*The Lilac Wars took a toll on the entirety of the Empire, we were, however, spared the worst of the devastation. We fought on the side of Lorent and finally overthrew those damned Silmunas, thus cementing House Silcalas' place at the top. At least for now. If we want to keep this position of power, we have to muster our men and march to secure our newly gained influence immediately.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.6</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li></ul> | <li>If teagansfield area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>define general:</li><ul><li>name = "Brendon Silcalas"</li><li>fire = 1</li><li>shock = 4</li><li>manuever = 2</li><li>siege = 2</li><li>trait = glory_seeker_personality</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A46_linking_up_calascandar">Linking Up Calascandar</a><br />*Calascandar, the greatest of Calasandur the Builder's castles! Beautiful, greatly defensible, and one of the CLSTC's main bases of operation. How the Marquis loves visiting this marvel of elven architecture with his family!\n\nHowever, the visits would be far more pleasant if we didn't have to pay a toll every time we want to go. Teagansfield being owned by anyone other than us is a nuisance, it slows down trade within our realm, not to mention the Company's operations. We must sweep away this annoyance at once and link up Calascandar with the rest of our realm.* | <li>teagansfield area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If north ibevar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south ibevar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If silent repose area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If rotwall area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>245:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>254:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul> | [Post-War Mobilization](#A46_postwar_mobilization)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_fortify_calascandar">Fortify Calascandar</a><br />*Calascandar is certainly a marvel of the world, the greatest castle within all of Anbennar. Our progenitor built it after all! However, as time marches on and technology advances around us, Calascandar's defenses may not be entirely up to the challenge of new innovations such as cannon barrages.\n\nWe must correct this at once, so that Calascandar may stand vigil over the Empire for a thousand years more.* | <li>254:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>254:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = arbaran_calascandar_the_great</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>908:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>262:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>add mercantilism = 3</li> | [Linking Up Calascandar](#A46_linking_up_calascandar)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_secure_ainway">Secure Ainway</a><br />*The rest of Aranmas remains vulnerable after losing Teagansfield. The Ainway would provide us with a perfect land route down into Esmaria, which we can use to export our goods South, free from exorbitant Crownsman tolls.* | <li>908:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>262:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 3</li><li>911:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>259:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Fortify Calascandar](#A46_fortify_calascandar)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_vanbury_trade_secrets">Vanbury Guild Trade Secrets</a><br />*The Vanbury Guild is one of the CLSTC's main competitors, as no-one can compete with their arms or armour in terms of quality. We must get our hands on their secret production techniques if we hope to compete. The easiest way to do this would be to ransack their headquarters in Telgeir. It may be a bit blunt, but if it works...* | <li>911:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>911:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -2</li></ul><li>254:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "arbaran_vanbury_secrets" for 50 years</li> | [Secure Ainway](#A46_secure_ainway)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_vanbury_production_techniques">Vanbury Guild Techniques</a><br />*The Vanburians sure know what they're doing when forging armour... Or did, at least, until we took all their secrets for ourselves.\n\nThey may flee west, but in Cannor the CLSTC will now provide the best arms and armour available. Production will be moved to Calascandar, and soon all our troops will be outfitted with Calascandar plate armour.* | <li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>254:</li><ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>weapons is at least 3</li> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier arbaran_calascandar_plate for 25 years</li> | [Vanbury Guild Trade Secrets](#A46_vanbury_trade_secrets)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_new_economic_heartland">Economic Heartland</a><br />*The Centre of power within the Empire has laid within the Dameshead for its entire history, but lately it has shifted. Our riches grow with Arbaran's conquests and the Company's expansion, and as such Arbaran's influence grows. No longer will the Empire's heartland be in the Damesear, nor in Esmaria or Damescrown. From now on Arbaran will be the Empire's new economic heartland.* | <li>cestir area:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>arbaran area:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>golden plains area:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>cestir area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = arbaran_imperial_economic_heartland</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>arbaran area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = arbaran_imperial_economic_heartland</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>golden plains area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = arbaran_imperial_economic_heartland</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Vanbury Guild Techniques](#A46_vanbury_production_techniques)<br />[Challenging Damescrown](#A46_challenging_damescrown_clstc)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_integrate_the_magnates">Integrate the Magnates</a><br />*We may have broken the power of the Kings of Gawed, but the real rulers behind the scenes remain. The magnates still wield immense power in the lands of the Alenic Frontier, and trying to break it would be counter-productive.\n\nInstead, we shall seek to work together with them and help them find a place in this new order we have established. A mutually beneficial agreement will be the best option for all.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 6</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is westmounts_area</li><li>area  is gawed_area</li><li>area   is south_alen_area</li><li>area    is alenic_expanse_area</li></ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If mawriver area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If serpentshead area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If northern greatwoods area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dinesck area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If west chillsbay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [A Meeting of Marquis and Magnates](../events/a_meeting_of_marquis_and_magnates.md) happens</li> | [Imperial Frontier](#A46_imperial_frontier)<br /> |

| <a name="A46_clstc_artisanry">CLSTC Artisanry</a><br />*While the Vanbury Guild is lauded for its weaponry and armour, the Calasanni Trading Company has always been regarded as the greatest producer of artisan goods in all of Cannor. This is no small part thanks to our Elven friends and their great expertise. We must further support the Elven workshops to make full use of their skills.* | <li>256:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>256:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = arbaran_elvenaire_workshops</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add mercantilism = 3</li> |  |
| <a name="A46_investment_from_clstc">CLSTC Investments</a><br />*The Calasanni Trading Company is the single most influential company in Cannor, perhaps the entire world. Naturally, it is run by the scions of our great house Silcalas. These familial connections help us in many ways, and we can always count on the company to have our backs.\n\nAfter all, the interests of the CLSTC are the interests of Arbaran, and vice versa. So let us help out our friends in the Company, so that they may help us out in turn.* | <li>254:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add years of income = 2</li><li>country gets the modifier "arbaran_clstc_investments" for 25 years</li> | [CLSTC Artisanry](#A46_clstc_artisanry)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_arbaran_at_sea">Arbaran at Sea</a><br />*The Dameshead is the defining feature of all Cannor, and thus if we hope to ever be able to project our power effectively over the rest of the Empire, we must build a fleet capable of doing so. Fortunately, having secured coastal holdings, we may finally build a fleet to rival even those of Damescrown or Vertesk.* | <li>navy size percentage is at least 1</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has port</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>245:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>If vertesk area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If floodmarches area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier arbaran_at_sea for 25 years</li> | [CLSTC Investments](#A46_investment_from_clstc)<br />[Secure the Border](#A46_secure_the_border)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_black_tower">The Black Tower</a><br />*The Citadel of Bal Vertesk towers over the Dameshead, casting its long shadow over Cannor and beyond. The city lies at the mouth of the river Alen, and controls the trade coming from the North. It is also the main hub of the Aelantiri slave trade. If we were to conquer Vertesk, our influence over the Dameshead would increase and we are sure to profit immensely.* | <li>216:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 3</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -2</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li></ul><li>254:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier arbaran_alen_trade for 25 years</li> | [Arbaran at Sea](#A46_arbaran_at_sea)<br /> |
| <a name="A46_ianrens_revenge">Ianren's Revenge</a><br />*The final defeat of Gawed was something our founders and our forefathers had dreamed about for centuries.
