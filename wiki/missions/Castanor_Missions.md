| <a name="castanor_reform_the_army">Restore the Legions</a><br />*Castanor arises! Our ascendancy shall be better than ever before, and the empire of the Castanites shall be beholden to none! Greatness awaits Castanor, and through the wise guidance of prepared Castans, there will be no sorcerer king to defile our legacy!\n\nEven so, there is much to be learned from the old Castanor. It is clear their military had some exceptional qualification to be able to conquer and defend such a vast tract of land.\n\nThis qualification, as it happens, are the Legions: Highly specialized armies that, more than simple fighting forces, served as the bases of expertise that allowed Castanor to overcome any foe, be they mortal or metal. Our new Castanor will never be complete unless it, too, has these Legions in its arsenal.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.4</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army tradition is at least 40</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>B32 ideas is at least 5</li><li>mil power is at least 500</li></ul> | <li>If does not have B32 ideas is 5:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -500</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = castanor_reform_the_army_trigger_tt</li><li>If has dlc is "Cradle of Civilization":</li><ul><li>If has army professionalism is 0.8:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier castanor_reforming_army_easy for 10 years</li></ul><li>Else if has army professionalism is 0.6:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier castanor_reforming_army_medium for 10 years</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier castanor_reforming_army_harsh for 10 years</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If has army tradition is 80:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier castanor_reforming_army_easy for 10 years</li></ul><li>Else if has army tradition is 60:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier castanor_reforming_army_medium for 10 years</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier castanor_reforming_army_harsh for 10 years</li></ul></ul> | [The Dawn of a New Age](#castanor_resurgence)<br /> |
| <a name="castanor_legion_leadership">Fit to Lead</a><br />*Of course, the Castanorian Legions were not just the rank and file. A strong officer class, with peerless generals experienced in both tactics and strategy led the way, the most well known of which may have been Caylen Longlance - the first knight himself.\n\nIf our reborn Legions are to march upon the known world once again, we must also attract and hire the best talent possible to lead them.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier castanor_reforming_army_harsh</li><li>has country modifier  castanor_reforming_army_medium</li><li>has country modifier   castanor_reforming_army_easy</li></ul><li>has leaders:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>type is general</li><li>include monarch is no</li><li>include heir is no</li></ul><li>has a three star general commanding an army</li> | <li>country gets the modifier castanor_good_legion_leadership for 20 years</li> | [Restore the Legions](#castanor_reform_the_army)<br /> |
| <a name="castanor_legion_doctrine">New Legion Doctrine</a><br />*It takes more than simply officially restoring the Legions as a group to truly gain their benefit. They must be prepared, the logistics and bureaucracy behind them established, and the official forces behind them drawn up and trained.\n\nOf course, solving one problem always leads to another. Now, it needs to be determined just how many need to be recruited, the extent of their training, and all other parts of our doctrine. Two camps have emerged, and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must adjudicate this dispute, so that the Legions may be molded to their full potential as quickly as possible in this age of shifting warfare.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 1</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>army size is at least 100</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [£icon_castanor_single_dragon_face_right£Castanorian Legion Doctrine£icon_castanor_single_dragon_face_left£](../events/psicon_castanor_single_dragon_face_rightpscastanorian_legion_doctrinepsicon_castanor_single_dragon_face_leftps.md) happens</li> | [Fit to Lead](#castanor_legion_leadership)<br /> |
| <a name="castanor_restore_bal_dostan">Restore Bal Dostan</a><br />*Bal Dostan was the second ever citadel built by Balgar the Builder. It was named and given to one of Castan the Progenitor's most legendary companions, Dostan the Explorer. Dostan was the one who ultimately led the Castanites out of the Deepwoods and into Escann after many years of wander, and toward their new home beneath the Trialmount. Bal Dostan and Dostanor, under Dostan and his successors, would become the center of power for Castanorian rule over the region for centuries.\n\nAfter the arrival of the elves, Bal Dostan was elvenized to Arca Corvur - or the Castle of the Corvurians, in unforgivable ignorance of the history of the citadel. In recent times, fell rumours swirl around the castle. People whisper of corrupted blood and unnatural darkness in the citadels' depths, even in the midday sun. If we are to reclaim the legacy of Castanor, we must start with the reclamation of Bal Dostan from its current, dark stewards.* | <li>441:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_dostan</li><li>tier is at least 2</li></ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_dostan</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building fort_16th</li><li>has building  fort_17th</li><li>has building   fort_18th</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>441:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Bal Dostan"</li><li>rename capital = "Bal Dostan"</li><li>change culture = castanorian</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If has ROOT has mission completed is castanor streamline tax efforts:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_citadel_local_admin_center</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>remove province modifier = castanorian_citadel</li></ul></ul><li>add prestige excess to splendour effect:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = castanor_unlock_legionway_south_castanor</li> |  |
| <a name="castanor_prepare_southern_legions">Legion: South Castanor</a><br />*All the overhead has been settled. There now lies nothing between a Legion and the battlefield (and the sundry settings of war) other than the official approval to deploy them.\n\nGo forth, proclaim a Legion. Use it as a tool, first and foremost, but use it as a lesson too - learn what it takes to operate one effectively, ensure every step of the way is done better than all the ones before it, for that is the true spirit of Castanor.* | <li>south castanor region:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>type is infantry</li><li>amount is at least 60</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any hired mercenary company:</li><ul><li>location:</li><ul><li>region is south_castanor_region</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is castanor_prepare_southern_legions_stacked_mercs_tt</li><li>any hired mercenary company:</li><ul><li>location:</li><ul><li>region is south_castanor_region</li><li>area for scope province:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>type is infantry</li><li>amount is at least 60</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is castanor_legion_in_training_tt</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [legion_in_training](../flags/legion_in_training.md)</li></ul></ul> | <li>If dostanor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If daravans folly region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If random province has num of units in province has who is ROOT, and num of units in province has type is infantry, and num of units in province has amount is 60; and  has region is south castanor region:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = B32</li><li>type = infantry</li><li>amount = 60</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>save event target as = castanor_legion_base_province</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_legion_base</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>the event [Proclaim a New Legion](../events/proclaim_a_new_legion.md) happens</li> | [Restore Bal Dostan](#castanor_restore_bal_dostan)<br /> |
| <a name="castanor_kobarids_to_kneel">Kobarids, to Kneel</a><br />*The Kobarid kingdom, or "Corvuria" as it calls itself, is a squatter wallowing in stolen holdings. During the Dragonwake, the Castanor of old was forced to withdraw from the kingdom of Dostanor. Not long after the citadel of Bal Dostan was vacated, it is believed that a figure named the Raven King briefly besieged and then seized the empty fortress before founding a kingdom based around the citadel.\n\nNo Castanor worth its pride would let such a grievous trespass stand as it has. March upon the Raven Kingdom, shatter its defences, incorporate its people as Dostanor, once again.* | <li>dostanor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If dostanor region has culture is human is yes:</li><ul><li>add unrest = -3</li><li>add nationalism = -5</li></ul><li>510:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>514:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>447:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Legion: South Castanor](#castanor_prepare_southern_legions)<br /> |

| <a name="castanor_fold_in_dostanorians">Fold in Dostanorians</a><br />*The lands that were once Dostanor have been ravaged and left in ruin. The north was overrun by barbarians that never quite fully succeeded in making the land their own. This can be particularly seen by Daravan's Folly, a hellish gnoll-infested swamp created by the same Daravan taking desperate steps to rectify the failures of their own forces. To the south is Bal Ouord. Much like the north, a kingdom sprouted out of the old citadel, but has fallen onto hard times recently during several waves of goblin incursions.\n\nNo matter their legacy, the peoples of Dostanor have nonetheless survived and still inhabit the old lands. They recognize that they are Dostanorian, but are simply a few steps removed from their true potential. With some nudging, they may be brought into the fold of the nation-state of humanity.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is castanor_fold_in_culture_tt_patrician</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any province:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li><li>culture group is dostanorian_g</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>set global flag [folding_in_dostanorians](../flags/folding_in_dostanorians.md)</li><li>add accepted culture = corvurian</li><li>add accepted culture = ourdi</li><li>add accepted culture = cardesti</li><li>add accepted culture = dostanorian</li><li>country gets the modifier castanor_folding_in_dostanorian until otherwise removed</li><li>If every subject country is subject of type is castanor dominion:</li><ul><li>add accepted culture = corvurian</li><li>add accepted culture = ourdi</li><li>add accepted culture = cardesti</li><li>add accepted culture = dostanorian</li><li>country gets the modifier castanor_folding_in_dostanorian until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>If has country flag is [patrician_castanor](../flags/patrician_castanor.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = castanor_fold_in_dostanorian_effect_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture group is dostanorian g:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_culture_convert_100</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is dostanor region, and has region is daravans folly region, and has region is ourdia region:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_fold_in_escanni_temp_mod</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Kobarids, to Kneel](#castanor_kobarids_to_kneel)<br /> |
| <a name="castanor_dostanorian_legacy">Legacy of the Dostanorians</a><br />*It is true that the peoples of the former Dostanor have, to some degree, mismanaged the rich legacy that they were left. Even so, their survival counts for something as well. Their perseverance through one disaster to another - the legendary White Plague, the incompetence of Daravan the Malignant, and even the prongs of the Greentide - has allowed them to survive as a people until our conquest.\n\nIt is clear that they are truly hardy folk. Analyze their perseverance, assimilate it, and empower the Castanor of the future to use it against disaster and calamity. Learn from the tragedies of their past, and from that stop them from ever happening again.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is castanor_cultural_legacy_trigger_tt</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any province:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li><li>culture group is dostanorian_g</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier castanor_first_and_final_empire_dostanorian until otherwise removed</li><li>remove country modifier = castanor_folding_in_dostanorian</li> | [Fold in Dostanorians](#castanor_fold_in_dostanorians)<br /> |

| <a name="castanor_foray_into_deepwoods">Foray into the Woods</a><br />*With the conquest of all Escann, the core lands of Castanor are now under our control. We are still beset on all sides by enemies, however, one of which is one of Castanor's most ancient - the Deepwoods and all its fey-corrupted and influenced denizens.\n\nWe must finish what Beastbane started - and unfortunately never had the chance to finish. The Deepwoods must be brought to civilization! The first step must be to secure one of the Outer Gladeways, some of the only accessible entrances into the cursed forest.* | <li>deepwoods outward gladeway:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If west deepwoods region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [In The Mire and Muck](#castanor_in_the_mire_and_the_muck)<br /> |
| <a name="castanor_infiltrating_the_interior">Infiltrating the Interior</a><br />*Every step into the Deepwoods brings us closer to our ultimate goal - the final eradication of Fey influence from our civilized world.

| <a name="castanor_third_great_cleansing">Third Great Cleansing</a><br />*The Second Great Cleansing, initiated by Castan II Beastbane, rid Castanor of many beasts and dangers to civilization, chief among them the centaurs. Beastbane was distracted before he could finish the job, however, as gnollish incursions drew his attention to Bulwar and the chaos there.\n\nWe will not leave the job half done, as Beastbane was forced to do.

| <a name="castanor_from_the_ashes">From the Ashes</a><br />*The Third Great Cleansing has brought fire and destruction to the former Deepwoods, yes, but it has also brought opportunity and riches for those willing to sift through the devastation. It is not enough to destroy the Deepwoods. We must now make it our own, as the Castanorians of old did with much of what is now South Castanor after pushing the Fey out.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has country flag [castanor_third_great_cleansing_tolerant_toward_elves](../flags/castanor_third_great_cleansing_tolerant_toward_elves.md)</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 30</li><li>superregion is deepwoods_superregion</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is wood_elf</li><li>culture  is castanorian</li></ul><li>religion is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 30</li><li>superregion is deepwoods_superregion</li><li>culture is castanorian</li><li>religion is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = castanor_from_the_ashes_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has country flag is [castanor_third_great_cleansing_tolerant_toward_elves](../flags/castanor_third_great_cleansing_tolerant_toward_elves.md):</li><ul><li>If every owned province has superregion is deepwoods superregion, and has culture is castanorian, and has culture is wood elf; and  has religion is ROOT, and does not have devastation is 1:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_from_the_ashes</li><li>duration = 10950</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has superregion is deepwoods superregion, and  has culture is castanorian, and  has religion is ROOT, and does not have devastation is 1:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_from_the_ashes</li><li>duration = 10950</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Third Great Cleansing](#castanor_third_great_cleansing)<br /> |
| <a name="castanor_seize_the_coast">Seize the Bahari Coast</a><br />*For almost four centuries, Bahar lay under the influence of Castanor. Castan the Progenitor first took over the region during his campaigns to rid the world of the demonic Xhazobine, and successive Castans continued to solidify Castanorian control there after, taking care not to anger their regional dwarven ally of Ovdal Tûngr.\n\nThroughout the Wars of Dominion with the Damerian Republic, Bahar remained relatively stalwart in Castanorian hands, even as Castanorian influence in Bulwar ebbed and flowed, but even this control ended in the chaos of the last century Before Ash, and Bahar would never again know the decrees of Castanor.\n\nThe arrival of Jaher a millennia later led to the humans of Bulwar being placed under the boot of the Sun Elves, and the later goblin exodus into the region were great contributors to the Decades of Devastation. For too long, the humans of Bahar have laboured under the yoke of their opportunistic oppressors. Now, it is up to us to restore the Castanorian Age to Bahar, and after, to all of Bulwar!* | <li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If harpy hills region does not have country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Legion: Dostanor](#castanor_proclaim_legion_dostanor)<br /> |

The terrain too rugged and the land too poor for any humans to permanently pacify, the hills are a homeland and refuge for the harpies and their never-ending raids on human settlements. Besides that, the Harpy Hills also block our passage into the rich lands of Bulwar, with the only land routes along its coastal bluffs or through its twisting mountain passes.

But, our task is not yet done. Old loyalties and old rivalries still smoulder - the Damescrownmen still balk at sharing trade lanes with Vertesker, while the Winebay merchants bristle at even the suggestion of allowing their rival's varietals ride on their ships.

Though none would ever contest that Castanor was the nation of the Castanites, as we approach a zenith that not even the empire of old could have even dreamed of, the empire of Castan becomes something else entirely. In our greatness, we have nearly forgotten our promise to humanity: that no human, anywhere, shall ever be subjected to the whims of another race. It is for this that we shall embrace the nation we are becoming - the nation of humanity. The Castanorians shall become more than the Castanites. All humans, no matter where, shall be able to turn to Castanor and embrace the culmination of their heritage.\n\nWe are the nation of humanity, if these past decades of labor have taught us anything. We must protect all humans, no matter where they are, for all of humanity must become the Castanorians. There will be no more Kheterata, where the people stand long deluded by creatures who seek only to exploit them. There will be no more Rahen, where the humans of the land are subjugated in accordance to a philosophy that preaches their oppression.\n\nThere will only be Castanor, and humanity shall all become its Castanites.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Emperor"</li></ul><li>is a hegemon</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has country flag [patrician_castanor](../flags/patrician_castanor.md)</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 1000</li><li>all province:</li><ul><li>culture is castanorian</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>num accepted cultures is at least 50</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 500</li><li>all province:</li><ul><li>culture is castanorian</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Humanity's Empire](../events/humanity_s_empire.md) happens</li> | [Genesis](#castanor_genesis)<br /> |

| <a name="castanor_all_roads_lead_to_castonath">All Roads Lead to Castonath</a><br />*As the largest city in Escann by an order of magnitude, and with walls that could in times of prosperity house many millions, Castonath was the epicenter of commerce in antiquity. All roads seemed to lead to Castonath and trade was the city's lifeblood, from the ancient dwarven convoys of metals out of Marrhold and Khugdihr to the silk and spice laden caravans from Bulwar on the Dragon Road.\n\nTime and circumstance changed all that. With the arrival of the elves and emergence of Anbennar, the locus of trade shifted ever westward, toward the geographically favored cities of the Dameshead. If we are to challenge the primacy of these upstarts, we must start by taking control of trade in Escann by facilitating the expansion or establishment of trade routes in places such as the Dwarovar and the Deepwoods.* | <li>840:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>872:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>888:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>811:</li><ul><li>has most province trade power this nation</li></ul><li>785:</li><ul><li>has most province trade power this nation</li></ul><li>229:</li><ul><li>has most province trade power this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is castanor_all_roads_lead_to_castonath_trigger_tt</li><li>has global flag [marrhold_canal](../flags/marrhold_canal.md)</li></ul> | <li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier castanor_all_roads_lead_to_castonath for 20 years</li> | [The Dawn of a New Age](#castanor_resurgence)<br /> |

The idea of being able to live near this lake, where one might behold a beautiful view of the greatest lake of the greatest empire to a great sunrise every morning, is deeply appealing to many in the higher classes.\n\nBy encouraging groups such as the Patricians to live in these new retreats by funding their construction as well as expediting the process to create them, we can effectively keep them content and securely away from where the important decisions are made.* | <li>nortmere area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>development is at least 12</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is province_is_prosperous</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li><li>is state</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>southgate area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>development is at least 12</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is province_is_prosperous</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li><li>is state</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>756:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul><li>835:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul><li>834:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul><li>829:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul><li>821:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul><li>820:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul><li>809:</li><ul><li>development is at least 12</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier castanor_lakeside_villas for 20 years</li> | [Role of the Old Guard](#castanor_a_greater_mantle)<br />[Jewel of Lake Silvermere](#castanor_restoring_the_south_citadel)<br /> |

The desperate flight away from the Xhazobine, the timely arrival of the Silver Dragon of Castellos, the lost years wandering through the Deepwoods, and miraculous appearance of the Wayguide, leading the Castanites on final leg of the journey to the future site of Castonath underneath the mighty Trialmount.\n\nWhat is truth, and what is myth, however? In this age of discovery and enlightenment and in light of the discovery of Castellos's fate, the former seems more important than ever. If we are to better understand our history and move forward into the future, it is inevitable that we must unravel this thread. [Root.Monarch.GetName] must undertake this journey [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], retracing the path of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors. Along the way, it seems inevitable that we will be able to dig up far more history than just our own - all the better to see how Castanor has triumphed over them.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 4</li><li>mil is at least 4</li><li>dip is at least 4</li></ul><li>adm is at least 6</li><li>mil is at least 6</li><li>dip is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>the event [Journey's Beginning](../events/journey_s_beginning.md) happens</li> | [Dragonforge Investments](#castanor_modernizing_the_forge)<br />[Wardens of the White Walls](#castanor_wardens_of_the_white_walls)<br />[Silvermere Retreats](#castanor_lakeside_villas)<br /> |

These lands could feed an empire, if they were properly tended. Unfortunately, they are not - they are staffed by local farmers who, for all their humility, simply do not provide more than what they need to live and a little extra. These farmers are ruled over by lords who, for all their grace, simply do not know what they are missing.\n\nThrough some creative solutions, these groups could be brought over to the idea of a more impressive scale of farming, such that their food could reach all of Castanor through new methods and improved scale.

Perhaps the most bitter of these is the taxation of money, for a man can do strange things when his finances are threatened. It is a never-ending arms race between the tax collectors and the tax collected to see who can best the other in a contest of intrigue.\n\nAs of recently, we have been on the losing side. Evolving methods of dodging taxation combined with an uneven, inconsistent application of tax collection has greatly harmed our finances - it is hard to say if we even have an accurate tally of the earnings of the Castanorian citizens. Should our taxation be centralized, streamlined, and consistently applied, we might be able to take our rightful dues from the citizens we watch over.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is castanor_streamline_tax_efforts_trigger_tt</li><li>castanorians citadels including new from mt:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has province modifier castanorian_citadel</li></ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier castanor_citadel_admin_center_country for 20 years</li><li>custom tooltip = castanor_streamline_tax_efforts_tt</li><li>If every owned province has province modifier is castanorian citadel, and has province modifier is castanor new citadel:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = castanorian_citadel</li><li>remove province modifier = castanor_new_citadel</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_citadel_local_admin_center</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>every subject country:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has province modifier is castanorian citadel, and has province modifier is castanor new citadel:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = castanorian_citadel</li><li>remove province modifier = castanor_new_citadel</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = castanor_citadel_local_admin_center</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Castanor's Breadbasket](#castanor_castanors_breadbasket)<br /> |

This is doubly true for their administration; the ever-growing hinterlands will eventually take a dominant course over the static domains of Castanor proper. This cannot be allowed to happen, for we are the empire of Castanor, and Castanor first and foremost, even if we rule all Cannor!\n\nA new administration needs to be arranged, one that can appropriately focus on the affairs and needs of our core lands in Castanor over the rest.

There are still pockets of the centaurs wandering about the plains, marauding and attacking any caravans who attempt to make the trip across it.

This is to mention nothing of the Ogres - a race of almost-giants who also send out the occasional raid through the plains.\n\nNo relationship can flourish so long as these beasts menace the civilians of the plains.
