| <a name="bulwar_clearing_out_rubble">Clearing Out the Rubble</a><br />*Tluukt's gnolls did an impressive amount of damage to the city. Though the defense was not necessarily steadfast, the demons nevertheless helped themselves to generous portions of the city's wealth, in addition to its inhabitants. Until just recently, we haven't had the resources to properly take stock of the situation - with a bit of funding, the twelve families are confident that they can audit the damages and begin the process of salvaging the destroyed buildings around the city, clearing the way for further development once more. * | <li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -50</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -20</li><li>add base tax = -3</li><li>add base production = -3</li><li>add base manpower = -3</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_city_reconstruction</li><li>duration = 730</li></ul></ul><li>add adm power = 150</li><li>add dip power = 150</li><li>add mil power = 150</li> | [Raising One's Head](#bulwar_raise_ones_head)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwar_repair_walls">Repair the Walls</a><br />*Naturally, the next step is to rebuild the walls around the city. Tluukt had them torn down in major part, leaving only a handful of battlements as a testament to our humiliation - but all that accomplished was ensuring that we know where the walls need to be built once more. With an impressive influx of building materials from salvaged buildings, there's plenty of supplies to rebuild the walls, so long as the labor can be accounted for. Who wouldn't want to work for Bulwar's safety?* | <li>601:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier bulwar_city_reconstruction</li></ul></ul><li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>If does not have mission completed is bulwar repair temple:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_completing_bulwar_repair_walls_effect_tt</li><li>custom tooltip = nsc_chosen_role_down_tt</li><li>add incident variable value:</li><ul><li>incident = incident_naqtazan</li><li>value = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -15</li><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_15th</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_city_reconstruction</li><li>duration = 730</li></ul></ul> | [Clearing Out the Rubble](#bulwar_clearing_out_rubble)<br /> |

| <a name="bulwar_black_phoenix">The Black Phoenix</a><br />*Poor Eledas... Everyone knows what Zokka did to him. Everyone knows how he feels about the gnolls. Even so, the ability to bring Sareyand to bear against Tluukt might yet turn out to be our salvation, bringing numbers to bear that any individual member of the Naqtazan could not hope to match. It will be a hard sell to the akal, yet a few rightly-placed words could still move his terror to righteous anger. * | <li>exists is Sareyand</li><li>F25:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_opinion_improved_70_tt</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is improved_relation</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>If does not have mission completed is bulwar a cult classic; and does not have mission completed is bulwar huddling with harklumi:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_completing_black_phoenix_first_effect_tt</li><li>custom tooltip = nsc_much_chosen_role_up_tt</li><li>add incident variable value:</li><ul><li>incident = incident_naqtazan</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>F25:</li><ul><li>the event [Bulwar's Offer](../events/bulwar_s_offer.md) happens</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_will_join_tluukt_war_if_accept_tt</li> | [Raising One's Head](#bulwar_raise_ones_head)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwar_repair_temple">Repair the Temple</a><br />*There is nearly nothing as important to Bulwar's existence as its great temple complex, the rightful home of the Sun Cult and the most important location in the region... which is nearly certainly why it was not spared from being looted. The situation is too dire to spare the resources for a total repair, so right now some surface-level renovations will have to suffice. Salvaging the city for building materials has yielded a plentiful sum of usable resources, so perhaps those can be put to productive use?* | <li>601:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier bulwar_city_reconstruction</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li> | <li>If does not have mission completed is bulwar repair walls:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_completing_bulwar_repair_temple_effect_tt</li><li>custom tooltip = nsc_chosen_role_up_tt</li><li>add incident variable value:</li><ul><li>incident = incident_naqtazan</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -15</li><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = temple</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_city_reconstruction</li><li>duration = 730</li></ul></ul> | [Clearing Out the Rubble](#bulwar_clearing_out_rubble)<br /> |

| <a name="bulwar_raise_ones_head">Raising One's Head</a><br />*The forces of light and goodness in Bulwar are in disarray. Beset on all sides, it would be foolish thinking to wait for a savior to emerge from the devastation, for their hands will be full with their own problems for a long time still. Bulwar will need to fend for herself - our city will need to begin assembling the Naqtazan, repairing itself, and preparing the circumstances necessary to ensure our survival in this chaotic world.* | <li>army size is at least 10</li> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = diplomat</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.75</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = spymaster</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.75</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="bulwar_a_cult_classic">A Cult Classic</a><br />*Eduz-Vacyn is a strong candidate for the Naqtazan, being both a religious center that needs to be brought to heel and a potentially invaluable source of manpower for the coming battle. The cult located in the city has their holdups about working with us (though even they acknowledge the threat posed by the gnolls), but are willing to do so if we can prove to them that the effort will be spearheaded by us - through a demonstration of our assembled army.* | <li>exists is Eduz-Vacyn</li><li>F31:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_opinion_improved_70_tt</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is improved_relation</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 30</li><li>F29:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_has_insulted_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is insulted</li></ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is scornfully_insulted</li></ul></ul></ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have mission completed is bulwar black phoenix:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_completing_black_phoenix_last_effect_tt</li><li>custom tooltip = nsc_chosen_role_down_tt</li><li>add incident variable value:</li><ul><li>incident = incident_naqtazan</li><li>value = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add dip power = -30</li><li>F31:</li><ul><li>the event [Bulwar's Offer](../events/bulwar_s_offer.md) happens</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_will_join_tluukt_war_if_accept_tt</li> | [Raising One's Head](#bulwar_raise_ones_head)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwar_league_of_our_own">In a League of Our Own</a><br />*We have assembled everyone we will get. Who we have standing with us is who will march to our aid against Tluukt. With the member list prepared, the time has come to formalize the alliance - to gather our new comrades-in-arms to finalize the details, major and minor, of what the Naqtazan will embody and strive to do.

| <a name="bulwar_huddling_with_harklumi">Huddling with the Harklumi</a><br />*Harklum would be a good addition to the Naqtazan. Their forces have no fondness for gnolls, and in addition to that their position allows them to take to the battlefield quickly and easily. They are more than willing to lend us their aid, but for a few menial tasks that they require Bulwar to carry out. Most can be handled discreetly by the twelve families, but they require the state to formally denounce Zokka and his gnolls - if that's all it takes, who are we to judge?* | <li>exists is Harklum</li><li>F36:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_opinion_improved_70_tt</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is improved_relation</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 30</li><li>F36:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have mission completed is bulwar black phoenix:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_completing_black_phoenix_last_effect_tt</li><li>custom tooltip = nsc_chosen_role_down_tt</li><li>add incident variable value:</li><ul><li>incident = incident_naqtazan</li><li>value = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add dip power = -30</li><li>F36:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>amount = 5</li></ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_garrison</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul></ul><li>F36:</li><ul><li>the event [Bulwar's Offer](../events/bulwar_s_offer.md) happens</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_will_join_tluukt_war_if_accept_tt</li> | [Raising One's Head](#bulwar_raise_ones_head)<br /> |

| <a name="bulwar_a_lot_to_unpack">A Lot to Unpack</a><br />*The Alukatran are quite fond of puns. In any case, Tluukt's greatest strength is that she was able to unify the gnolls in the region to her cause, mostly through force. Gnolls are quite a fractious lot, especially when they are only cowed through the threat of violence. If we were to route a few resources towards a few of these gnolls, they could be persuaded to attack Tluukt in a moment of weakness - such as, say, when she is attacked by the Naqtazan.* | <li>exists is Tluukt</li><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Tluukt</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Zansap</li></ul><li>F43:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_opinion_improved_70_tt</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is improved_relation</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = F28</li><li>value = -30</li></ul><li>add treasury = -50</li><li>U09:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = F28</li><li>modifier = nsc_suspicious_behaviour_big</li></ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = F28</li><li>value = -35</li><li>mutual = no</li></ul></ul><li>F29:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = F28</li><li>modifier = nsc_suspicious_behaviour_big</li></ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = F28</li><li>value = -35</li><li>mutual = no</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = bulwar_rebels_in_tluukt_tt</li> | [Raising One's Head](#bulwar_raise_ones_head)<br /> |

| <a name="bulwar_banking_district">The Banking District</a><br />*One of the ways to the future is through finance. Though what is made in Bulwar can be sold elsewhere, and for a long time, there is no guarantee it will stay competitive forever. Banking is an immortal field, for we will never not need money, and so it is a surefire way to make sure Bulwar stays relevant. In addition to that, bankers directly from the city are more likely to assist financially in expansion and development...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is fula_in_government_tt</li><li>has country flag [fula_in_government](../flags/fula_in_government.md)</li></ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>base tax is at least 12</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_banking_district_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [At Close Quarters](#bulwar_at_close_quarters)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwar_in_mint_condition">In Mint Condition</a><br />*The biggest barrier to uniting the region is its lack of uniformity - every akalate had their own way of going about business, but all of them were different from one another. We had to keep much of it during our acquisitions. Every region is disconnected, islands in the sea of land. No more! We will make sure business can extend region-wide through a single currency. There will be no exchanges, no arguments over value, only one coin: The Sur. We only need to find something to back it.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_banking_upgrade_ready_tt</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>banking district progress is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gold</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is treasurer</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is master_of_mint</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>banking district progress = 0</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = bulwar_banking_district_1</li><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>banking district progress = 0</li></ul></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_banking_district_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Banking District](#bulwar_banking_district)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwar_a_sur_thing">A Sur Thing</a><br />*The Sur will work wonders! It already has gone a long way to strengthening Bulwar, and in addition to that the single currency has allowed the bankers to grow fruitfully. We need to make sure faith in the Sur is unshakeable - make it a Sur thing, if you will.Through smart policy and minimal inflation, we can make sure nobody ever wants to go back to the old ways. The banks will thank us too.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_banking_upgrade_ready_tt</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>banking district progress is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>full idea group is economic_ideas</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>inflation is at least 2</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>splendor is at least 250</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>prestige is at least 30</li></ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>development is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>If has dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>add splendor = -250</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = -30</li></ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = bulwar_banking_district_2</li><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>banking district progress = 0</li></ul></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_banking_district_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [In Mint Condition](#bulwar_in_mint_condition)<br /> |

| <a name="bulwar_temple_district">The Temple District</a><br />*The temples of Bulwar were the places most hard hit by the Tluukti gnolls. Picked clean of valuables and then torched, the many religious centers in the district were destroyed so badly that in some places it's hard to figure out what stood there at all. We were able to do some renovations already, but those are better described as "salvage" than any actual construction. Something needs to be done.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is aharmandas_in_government_tt</li><li>has country flag [aharmandas_in_government](../flags/aharmandas_in_government.md)</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_temple_district_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [At Close Quarters](#bulwar_at_close_quarters)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwar_through_red_coloured_glass">Through Red Coloured Glass</a><br />*It wouldn't be right just to rebuild and not to improve, right? The bounty of Bulwar the region has been unused on Bulwar the city, for political division and isolation has stopped the city from taking advantage of the beautiful local specialties that might adorn its temples. Azanerdu glass is a wonderful thing, and particularly absent from our temples. Showing the light of Surael should be done through the labors of all His children, not just some - we need to make sure plenty of that lovely red glass can find a home in Bulwar.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_temple_upgrade_ready_tt</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>temple district progress is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>600:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>temple district progress = 0</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = bulwar_temple_district_1</li><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>temple district progress = 0</li></ul></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_temple_district_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Temple District](#bulwar_temple_district)<br /> |
| <a name="bulwar_red_lights_dancing_flammes">Dancing Flames</a><br />*The great complex. Those gnolls can never be forgiven for what they've done... but that's water in the Suran, now. What has been damaged needs to be replaced, rebuilt, recreated. It's not just enough to simply bring it back to the state it was in before - tradition, and our faith, dictates that we need to build the ziggurat better than ever before. This will not be cheap, and it certainly will not be fast, but that's just what it takes to make something great. There will be no twilight for Bulwari's place in the faith.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bulwar_temple_upgrade_ready_tt</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>temple district progress is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is theologian</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is inquisitor</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>splendor is at least 250</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>prestige is at least 30</li></ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>development is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>If has dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>add splendor = -250</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = -30</li></ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = bulwar_temple_district_2</li><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>temple district progress = 0</li></ul></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_temple_district_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>fire province event [flavour_bulwar_tag.23](flavour_bulwar_tag.23_slug) in 1825 days</li></ul> | [Through Red Coloured Glass](#bulwar_through_red_coloured_glass)<br /> |

| <a name="bulwar_at_close_quarters">At Close Quarters</a><br />*Though the sacking of Bulwar was not a good thing, there is still opportunity to be found in the rubble. We can take this chance to redesign the city, reorganizing it into a number of districts. Here, instead of ramshackle building, the concentration of roles will create something far more productive than the sum of what is in it. Naturally, of course, we will be contracting this to the 12 families to do as they see fit.* | <li>is incident happened is incident_naqtazan</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier bulwar_city_reconstruction</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul><li>development is at least 23</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_city_planning</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = bulwar_districts_manager</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="bulwar_kanu_district">The Kanu District</a><br />*One of Bulwar's greatest exports is the silk it outputs.

Because of that, they are able to pursue ties elsewhere - though they never forget where their real home is! Brasan has a remarkably loose method for selecting their candidates. Should we be able to grease a few palms, then it's very possible we could elect one of the 12 families to rule the city in our stead.

| <a name="bulwar_dip_in_divenhal">A Dip in the Divenhal</a><br />*Nobody can compete without a navy. Though much of Bulwar is inland, there is too much wealth in the Divenhal to leave it to gnollish pirates and Cannorians. Brasan and Anzabad both occupy prime spots to create not only harbors, but a rich naval infrastructure for making a Bulwari navy. If we can harness that potential, it will pay back tenfold.* | <li>565:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul><li>560:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>565:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_great_shipyards</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>560:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bulwar_great_shipyards</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Rabsukalukaturan](#bulwar_rabsukalukaturan)<br /> |
