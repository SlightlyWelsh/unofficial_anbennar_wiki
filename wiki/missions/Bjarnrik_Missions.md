| <a name="bjarnrik_defeat_obrtrol">End the Troll Menace!</a><br />*Long have the hated Trolls dwelt in the rocky crags of the Dalrfjall, hunting and enslaving our people with almost no fear of impunity. Not since the days of Bera have the Trolls been driven back; the mountains are the border between civilization and barbarity. Far worse than just the violence and fear they bring, the vile Trolls steal our people and force them to toil in the pits and mines of the mountains until their death. This has gone on for far too long: let us unite the clans, assemble the armies, and end their villainy once and for all!* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Obrtrol</li></ul><li>owns 995</li><li>owns  996</li> | <li>995:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li></ul><li>996:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li></ul><li>969:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>998:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>968:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="bjarnrik_great_troll_hunt">The Great Troll Hunt</a><br />*The borderlands of Sidaett have always been sparsely populated, bordering the troll-infested taiga of Far Gerudia. The cousins of the Dalrfjall trolls, the ones of the forest are no less savage and less deserving of our justice. After our great victory over Obrtrol our warriors are warriors are itching for another challenge: let us send them into the Gullmork to fight some more Trolls!* | <li>gullmork area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>manpower is at least 3</li> | <li>add manpower = -3</li><li>country gets the modifier "bjarnrik_great_troll_hunt" for 15 years</li><li>gullmork area:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Slay the Troll Masters!](#bjarnrik_purge_the_dalrfjall_trolls)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_new_skaldskolan_temple">Renovation of Skaldol</a><br />*Skaldol is the beating heart of the Skaldhyrric Faith, a temple-city nestled in the craggy foothills of the Titan's Rest Mountains. It is a site of great importance, for it is said that the recitation of 'The Dragon and the Skald' by the Master Skald-Priest keeps the dragon Elkaesal asleep, and the endless winter at bay. However, Skaldol is only a hamlet compared to the greater cities of Gerudia and lands beyond the Giant's Grave Sea. As the protector of our faith, it is our duty to renovate Skaldol into a position of glory that it deserves.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 976</li><li>976:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 25</li><li>dip power is at least 25</li><li>mil power is at least 25</li> | <li>add adm power = -25</li><li>add dip power = -25</li><li>add mil power = -25</li><li>976:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="bjarnrik_siddaet_fur_amber">Sidaetti Furs and Amber</a><br />*The forests of Gerudia teem with rich game fur, perfect for keeping oneself warm during winter and for enriching your pocket trading with the southerners. Clan Sidaett holds many of these lands, although in the extreme far north it is difficult enough even to survive let alone hunt for profit. Funding should be provided for enriching Sidaett by providing food and essentials for them to allow the province to focus on producing furs and the rare amber of Vargrhol.* | <li>966:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>965:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>ismark area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li> | <li>add years of income = -1</li><li>966:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>965:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_sidaett_trade"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>ismark area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_sidaett_trade"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="bjarnrik_fiorgam">Fiorgam</a><br />*The tales were true! Freidar the Mad Mariner has found a land across the seas which he has named 'Fiorgam', an obvious misspelling of 'Fjord' and the Skald knows what 'gam' means. Reminiscent of home, the island is covered in forested steep fjords. This island should be claimed for Bjarnrík as a staging point for control of this new land.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>area is fiorgram_island_area</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 949</li> | <li>949:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>fiorgram island area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Westward Voyages](#bjarnrik_westward_voyages)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_stalwart_outpost">A Stalwart Outpost</a><br />*The shores of this new land are strange indeed, from crimson-tinged swamps to this - a massive glacier perched atop a massive cliff. This frozen land is different than Far Gerudia, for it is almost completely devoid of life. The snow and ice itself seems cursed, as if the land were still under Elkaesal's spell of winter. Still, our explorers have found curious artifacts buried underneath the ice: we must explore further!* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 2787</li> | <li>2787:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_stalwart_outpost"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>If does not have trade goods is precursor relics:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = precursor_relics</li></ul></ul> | [Fiorgam](#bjarnrik_fiorgam)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_frozen_anomalies">Frozen Anomalies</a><br />*Underneath the ice of the Dalairey Wastes are ancient elven artifacts, and sometimes even ruins. They fetch a hefty price in Cannor, but also offer great insight into matters both arcane and scientific. A permanent center of research should be established to further understand these relics and what exactly had happened here.* | <li>2787:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2787:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = tradecompany</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> | [A Stalwart Outpost](#bjarnrik_stalwart_outpost)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_prospect_for_copper">Copper Prospecting</a><br />*Professors from the Geological Institute of the Dalr have sent expeditions to map the geological topography and bedrock of Gerudia, and have some discoveries that may interest the Konungr. A representative from the Institute has arrived and has presented thee with cuprite and chalcopyrite, copper ores, from the Dalrfjall mountains. The Institute has requested funding to construct a mine and foundry in Brutnord to extract and process the copper, promising a generous cut of the pay for the crown.* | <li>owns core province 994</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type natural_scientist</li><li>ruler has personality is free_thinker_personality</li><li>ruler has personality  is scholar_personality</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>994:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is copper:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = copper</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add mil power = 50</li></ul></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Dalr Geologic Institute](#bjarnrik_geological_institute_of_the_dalr)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_prospect_for_gold">Gold Exploration</a><br />*Glodborg, a small town in the Titan's Rest Mountains, is named after an old legend of the first settlers finding gold nuggets under the fjord bay. Unfortunately for them they did not realize that gold could be found in much higher quantities as both small grains hidden in the sediment, and in veins within quartz-rich granite higher in the mountains. The Geological Institute of the Dalr has requested funding for establishing a series of river sluices and materials for mining of the quartz-rich granite.* | <li>owns core province 974</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type natural_scientist</li><li>ruler has personality is free_thinker_personality</li><li>ruler has personality  is scholar_personality</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>974:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is gold:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gold</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add mil power = 50</li></ul></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Copper Prospecting](#bjarnrik_prospect_for_copper)<br />[Prospect for Iron](#bjarnrik_prospect_for_iron)<br /> |

| <a name="bjarnrik_bear_over_murtrhol">The Bear Over Murtrhol</a><br />*Obrtrol lies defeated, our victory secure. The trolls have sent us an offer, promising us fealty to the Konungr if they are allowed a degree of autonomy in the Dalrfjall mountains. Of course, by that they mean that they wish to continue to enslave our people in their mines. But their offer is enticing: the trolls make formidable warriors, and their mines profitable. What if we were to accept? Let us convince our liberated brethren that they are safer now under our rule, and have nothing to fear from their Troll masters.* | <li>dalrfjall area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>thurrsbol area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -150</li><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add accepted culture = fjord_troll</li><li>medium increase of troll tolerance effect = yes</li><li>dalrfjall area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_autonomous_troll_clans"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>thurrsbol area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_autonomous_troll_clans"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>968:</li><ul><li>add troll minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>970:</li><ul><li>add troll minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>971:</li><ul><li>add troll minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>998:</li><ul><li>add troll minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>complete mission = bjarnrik_purge_the_dalrfjall_trolls</li><li>complete mission = bjarnrik_great_troll_hunt</li></ul> | [End the Troll Menace!](#bjarnrik_defeat_obrtrol)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_dalrfjall_prison_mines">Dalrfjall Prison Mines</a><br />*There is a tradition among the Fjord Trolls to enslave captured humans for work in their mines, dating back to some ancient decree from the fabled Frost Giants. We could utilize this tradition, our Troll subjects in the Dalrfjall mountains will happily accept some more laborers, and without doubt will not host any questions on our intentions. Our criminals and prisoners will serve their sentence in the mines, far outpaying the cost of hosting them, and without risk of escaping under the watchful Trolls. Those that fulfill their sentence will have earned their freedom.* | <li>dalrfjall area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>thurrsbol area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>995:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>994:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>1000:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>medium increase of troll tolerance effect = yes</li><li>dalrfjall area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_dalrfjall_prison_mines"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>thurrsbol area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_dalrfjall_prison_mines"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "bjarnrik_forest_troll_allies" for 30 years</li> | [The Bear Over Murtrhol](#bjarnrik_bear_over_murtrhol)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_golden_forest">Explore the Golden Forest</a><br />*Gullmork, the 'Golden Forest' as the Cannorians would say, stretches as a blanket of wooded wilderness before the endless barren wastes of Far Gerudia. An ancient tale from our ancestors tells us that somewhere in these woods lies gold; although it is a cautionary tale against rash decisions, the Skalds tell us that now the tale is true. More than just gold however, the woods are full of valuable furs. While we search for the much-coveted gold, it would be wise to populate these land permanently and establish trade connections with the rest of Gerudia.* | <li>gullmork area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>gifrbygd area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>2830:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2831:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2830:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li><li>If does not have trade goods is gold:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gold</li></ul></ul><li>gullmork area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_gullmork_gold"</li><li>duration = 10950</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>gullmork area:</li><ul><li>add troll minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>gifrbygd area:</li><ul><li>add troll minority size effect = yes</li></ul></ul> | [The Great Troll Hunt](#bjarnrik_great_troll_hunt)<br />[Dalrfjall Prison Mines](#bjarnrik_dalrfjall_prison_mines)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_westward_voyages">Westward Voyages</a><br />*Long have tales spoken of lands seldom visited, shrouded past the glaciated expanses of Far Gerudia and the ever breaking waves of the Sea of Storms. Few openly admit it, but these tales are often viewed as being but fairy tales by most. But not Freidar, known as the Mad Mariner. A survivor of a particularly disastrous shipwreck in the Sea of Storms, Freidar cobbled together a raft on a barren rock known on no maps. This experience must have been traumatic beyond comprehension, but Freidar does not fear the sea anymore. Freidar has been known as the 'Mad Mariner' for ranting and crying at all hours about the lands to the west, full of trees and gold. The council cannot recommend him enough as the leader for a grand expedition across the seas to the west!* | <li>has idea group exploration_ideas</li><li>exploration ideas is at least 1</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has personal deity voyage_of_the_north_raider</li><li>has personal deity  dirge_of_the_deep</li><li>has personal deity   master_boat_builders_of_far_gerudia_beyond</li><li>ruler has personality is navigator_personality</li><li>ruler has personality  is expansionist_personality</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is aelantir_discovery.tooltip</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>colonial endralliande:</li><ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul><li>colonial dalaire:</li><ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "the_unknown_frontier" for 15 years</li> | [Construct the Stormfleet](#bjarnrik_stormfleet)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_ambercoast">Ambrströnd</a><br />*Freidar also discovered pine-covered land to the north of Fiorgam not unlike the northern expanses of Gerudia, named Ambrströnd after the curious amber and sap found on the trees. This land, unlike Fiorgam, is populated by icy blue people with penetrating yellow eyes that watch us from the forests. Despite these Teira, the land remains fairly empty and no less habitable than the woods of Vargrhol. Ambrströnd should be colonized for our people to relieve the burgeoning population and shortages at home, and to gain access to the resources hidden under these wintry woods.* | <li>any province:</li><ul><li>region is dalaire_region</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "colonial_enthusiasm" for 20 years</li> | [Westward Voyages](#bjarnrik_westward_voyages)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_frondvagr">Frondvagr</a><br />*The gateway to inland Dalaire because of the mighty Hjora estuary, Frondvagr has attracted the attention of many wishful colonists. Our colony in Dalaire wishes to secure it for the Konungr, and swiftly follow forth with settling the upper river. Just north from Frondvagr the Teira dwell in their largest settlement, aptly named Teirainé in Elven. They will make a fine addition to our colony.* | <li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is this nation</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 1202</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  1207</li></ul> | <li>1202:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "bjarnrik_ambercoast" for 25 years</li> | [Ambrströnd](#bjarnrik_ambercoast)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_mineral_exploration">Dalairey Mineralogy</a><br />*While Dalaire is certainly full of goods like furs and lumber, there is more to the land that is not visible at first glance. Pioneers and explorers into the woods have found curious shining stones on the surface, often found among strange boulders sitting on the surface. Ores such as iron, copper, and gold, silver hide beneath our very feet! These discoveries have attracted the attention of intellectuals from the homeland: let us make sure they have plenty to examine!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_dalaire</li><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is iron</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_dalaire</li><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is copper</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_dalaire</li><li>value is at least 1</li><li>trade goods is gold</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_dalaire</li><li>value is at least 1</li><li>trade goods is gems</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "bjarnrik_geological_studies" for 25 years</li> | [Frondvagr](#bjarnrik_frondvagr)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_geological_institute_of_the_dalr">Dalr Geologic Institute</a><br />*The recent discoveries and exploration of mineral wealth in the Dalaire region has ignited a fierce interest in all things geological. How were these ore formations created, why are the continents the way they are, why is there a giant ring of cliffs in the Ruin? And most importantly of all, where can we find more ores and minerals, using scientific knowledge? These scholars have petitioned the Konungr for funding to create an institution for which they can host experiments, expeditions, and teach their new skills. Of these new scholars are dwarven experts who bring knowledge from their holds and their families.* | <li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>owns core province 956</li> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>956:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = university</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>small increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Dalairey Mineralogy](#bjarnrik_mineral_exploration)<br />[Frozen Anomalies](#bjarnrik_frozen_anomalies)<br /> |
| <a name="bjarnrik_prospect_for_iron">Prospect for Iron</a><br />*Kaldrland has always had been a barren land, bereft of resources other than wild beasts and plagued by strange toxic red water that seeps from the ground. This has always been a mystery for ages: the Geological Institute of the Dalr has proposed that this red water is acid mine drainage from pyrite and other iron ores under the earth. They ask for funding to test this hypothesis, and promise to provide the crown with a generous portion of the profits.* | <li>owns core province 969</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type natural_scientist</li><li>ruler has personality is free_thinker_personality</li><li>ruler has personality  is scholar_personality</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>969:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is iron:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = iron</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li></ul></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Dalr Geologic Institute](#bjarnrik_geological_institute_of_the_dalr)<br /> |

That is, the ones that have presented to the Konungr. In recent years coal has become a subject of much interest in Cannor for its value as fuel for furnaces; the Institute has produced a theory that there may be more coal than is immediately visible in Gerudia. Coal may be the product of ancient organic matter condensed under great pressure. The Institute proposes that there may be coal nearby the hold of Fuglborg, a leftover of the great flood that drowned the Frost Giants of old.* | <li>is institution enabled is enlightenment</li><li>owns core province 953</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type natural_scientist</li><li>ruler has personality is free_thinker_personality</li><li>ruler has personality  is scholar_personality</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>953:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is coal:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = coal</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 25</li><li>add dip power = 25</li><li>add mil power = 25</li></ul></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Copper Prospecting](#bjarnrik_prospect_for_copper)<br />[Prospect for Iron](#bjarnrik_prospect_for_iron)<br /> |

| <a name="bjarnrik_jotunsglotta">Jotunsglotta Fortifications</a><br />*The Frozen Pass is much coveted as the sea connection between the Giant's Grave Sea, the Dragon Coast, and beyond. Although we control many of the small isles that dot the pass, Serpentgard and its protector Celmaldor have long kept us from imposing tolls. The Jotunsglotta are still of use to us however: they will make a prime defensive location to stop invaders from crossing the pass into Gerudia. And they will also be a prime staging ground for forces.* | <li>owns core province 708</li><li>708:</li><ul><li>province has current tech fort trigger is yes</li></ul> | <li>708:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bjarnrik_jotunsglotta_fortified_pass"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>698:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="bjarnrik_poke_the_eyegard">Poke the Eyegard</a><br />*Serpentgard has been a thorn in our side for far too long: long have they resisted the Crown of Bera. The early kingdom of Bjarnrík and the as-of-yet disunited peoples of the Serpentshead were embattled over control over the Frozen Pass isles in the late 10th century. While our armies besieged their fortresses, their elite warriors the "Sea-Serpents" snuck by and struck at our stronghold of Fuglborg. Our city sacked, Bjarnrík's armies withdrew to deal with this invasion of their homeland only to find the Sea-Serpents had disappeared into the marsh as quickly as they appeared. Now, the petty nobles of Serpentgard pride themselves on their treacherous victory.

While the southerners spin their cloth with machines, ours will be vast foundries of iron and steel powered by the combustion of coal. Gerudia and the northern lands contain ample quantities of iron, coal, and other minerals that fuel our industrial might. Rivers and fjords provide efficient transportation, and power waterwheels with their churning strength. Bjarnrík will be a shining beacon of progress, the standard of industrial might! * | <li>is institution enabled is enlightenment</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>furnace is at least 2</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>amount is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "proto_industrialization" for 25 years</li><li>956:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = enlightenment</li><li>value = 50</li></ul></ul> | [The Northern Empire](#bjarnrik_northern_empire)<br /> |
