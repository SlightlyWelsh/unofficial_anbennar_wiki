| <a name="A16_protect_toarnaire">Protect Toarnaire</a><br />*Our vassal city Toarnaire must not fall to Lorentish ambition. If we are to maintain our control over trade in the Bay of Wines then we need access to the port of Toarnaire. Their protection from any foreign threats will be ensured, in exchange for their closer integration into the League.* | <li>33:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul><li>Province 33 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>33:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = wineport_toarnaire_defensiveness</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="A16_imperial_port">The Imperial Port</a><br />*Toarnaire is technically within the Empire of Anbennar, even if we are the true masters of its politics, and thus is our key into entering Imperial politics. And by politics, we of course mean the seizure of Imperial territory to benefit our commercial domain.* | <li>33:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If eastern winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Unite the League](#A16_unite_league)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_trading_rights">Imperial Trading Rights</a><br />*Trading rights within the Empire of Anbennar are closely protected by the mercantile elites of Beepeck and Damescrown, but we have a way in. Through our control of Toarnaire we can work some diplomatic magic on the current Emperor, along with the offer of money finding its way into the correct pockets, and boom! We now have the rights to trade our wines throughout the Empire.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>hre size is at least 1</li></ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>value is at least 100</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier wineport_imperial_trade_rights for 15 years</li> | [The Imperial Port](#A16_imperial_port)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_find_sponsors">The Pearl Gambit</a><br />*The toll Pearlsedge exacts on merchants wishing to trade in Imperial markets is an offense to all the Merchants of the Empire. Through a contract with the Merchant Republics of the Dameshead, we will remove this toll by force, and seize the pearls for ourselves, with a promise to remove the toll after they come into our possession.* | <li>234:</li><ul><li>strongest trade power:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>value is at least 150</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = 200</li><li>14:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>234:</li><ul><li>strongest trade power:</li><ul><li>save global event target as = wineport_sponsor</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Imperial Trading Rights](#A16_trading_rights)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_pop_cork">Promises are Promises</a><br />*The time has come for us to make good on our agreement with the Imperial merchants and lift the Damespearl Entrance Toll. Of course, the other option would be to simply... go back on our deal. The money would be a great boon to our coffers.* | <li>Province 14 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>the event [Popping the Cork](../events/popping_the_cork.md) happens</li><li>11:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Pearl Gambit](#A16_find_sponsors)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_bloody_teeth">Bloody Teeth</a><br />*Following up on our seizure of the Pearls, we've also taken the Damesteeth islands, where another dastardly toll is exacted, this time by Silmuna dynasty. Controllers of the Empire for years, they supported and encouraged the tolls levied against merchants. Once again, we have the responsibility as good merchants to remove these obstructions to trade. And yet still, the funding is always needed.* | <li>Province 11 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>the event [Bloody Teeth](../events/bloody_teeth.md) happens</li> | [Promises are Promises](#A16_pop_cork)<br /> |

| <a name="A16_seeking_support">Seeking Support</a><br />*Lorent and the Wine Lords no doubt wish to reclaim their lost territory, and this puts us in their sights. Thus, we need to search for allies against all threats to our sovereignty and ensure the crowns continue to flow.* | <li>num of allies is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier wineport_to_let_them_survive for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A16_recognition">International Recognition</a><br />*With allies secured, now we need to make the world recognize our cause. Wineport wine should be known by all, and in the back of their minds while they get plastered should be the thought of ensuring that our wine keeps flowing.* | <li>prestige is at least 20</li> | <li>country gets the modifier wineport_recognized for 25 years</li> | [Seeking Support](#A16_seeking_support)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_toarnaire_ties">Ties to Toarnaire</a><br />*Toarnaire's independence and membership in the Empire was always a formality. They were, are now, and always shall be a core member of the League. No emperor of Anbennar, Lorentish king, or count of Saloren can say anything to change that.* | <li>owns 33</li> | <li>33:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = wineport_core_city</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = wineport_centralize</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>If has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 200</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Unite the League](#A16_unite_league)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_roilsard">Thorned Vines</a><br />*We are now in control of the Roilsard lands and the Roilsardi people are at our disposal. With centuries of experience surviving wedged between powerful states, we could learn a thing or two from them, and use that experience to further expand ourselves into profitable territory.* | <li>eastern winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If pearlywine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Ties to Toarnaire](#A16_toarnaire_ties)<br />[The Imperial Port](#A16_imperial_port)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_miltary_expert">Roilsardi Military Minds</a><br />*The Roilsardi have two things we need very badly, centuries of experience in anti-cavalry tactics, and commanders with a taste for Lorentish blood. Both are always useful to our forces, and we should be sure to integrate these 'Thorn formations' into our army as soon as possible.* | <li>eastern winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0</li></ul></ul><li>mil power is at least 200</li> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier wineport_roilsardi_expertise until otherwise removed</li> | [Thorned Vines](#A16_roilsard)<br />[Organize the Watchers](#A16_organize_watchers)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_imperial_vintage">Imperial 'Vintage'</a><br />*The nobles of the Empire enjoy wine and drink almost as much as the nobility of Lorent, while they may enjoy different drinks, it would be just as profitable to engage in trade with them. Though it would help to have a port within the Empire itself.* | <li>Province 41 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li><li>owns or subject of  49</li> | <li>If neckcliffe area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A22</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 600</li></ul> | [Roilsardi Military Minds](#A16_miltary_expert)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_merchant_port">Merchant Ports</a><br />*Taking Neckcliffe as a safe harbor for our ships has been a great boon to our merchants, who no longer need to pay either Neckcliffer or Imperial taxes, and to ferry goods into the Dameshead. They simply stop off in Neckcliffe, and sail on to the merchant ports of Beepeck and Damescrown. No need to pull into the harbor of Anbenncóst and pay its exorbitant harbor tolls!* | <li>neckcliffe area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>A22:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change government = republic</li></ul><li>add government reform = merchants_reform</li><li>add liberty desire = -50</li></ul> | [Imperial 'Vintage'](#A16_imperial_vintage)<br />[Promises are Promises](#A16_pop_cork)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_minar_colony">Colonies of Minar</a><br />*The Temples and Priests of Minar have come to us requesting an effort on the part of the council to make efforts to acquire colonies in the land of Aelantir. They wish to spread Minar’s love to these new lands, and assure us it will also be financially profitable.* | <li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is this nation</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 1</li><li>trade goods is wine</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul></ul> | <li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier wineport_tariffs for 50 years</li> | [Gold, God, Good Wine](#A16_minar_missions)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_tears_of_blood">Tears of Blood</a><br />*Running into the great Ruined Sea is the Ynn River, falling down the Cliffs of Ruin at a Waterfall called Venaan’s Tears. This river and its water bear a similarity to the Bloodwine that flows through our land — it's undoubtedly a good bet that we could set up vineyards along its banks as well.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 3</li><li>all province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is trollsbay_region</li><li>region  is sarda_region</li></ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>value is at least 100</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul><li>trade goods is wine</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li><li>If random province has region is trollsbay region, and  has owner has opinion has value is 100, and has opinion has who is ROOT; and  has trade goods is wine, and does not have building is farm estate; and does not have construction is farm estate:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = farm_estate</li><li>cost = 0</li><li>speed = 1</li></ul></ul><li>If random province has region is trollsbay region, and  has owner has opinion has value is 100, and has opinion has who is ROOT; and  has trade goods is wine, and does not have building is farm estate; and does not have construction is farm estate:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = farm_estate</li><li>cost = 0</li><li>speed = 1</li></ul></ul><li>If random province has region is trollsbay region, and  has owner has opinion has value is 100, and has opinion has who is ROOT; and  has trade goods is wine, and does not have building is farm estate; and does not have construction is farm estate:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = farm_estate</li><li>cost = 0</li><li>speed = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Colonies of Minar](#A16_minar_colony)<br /> |

| <a name="A16_build_bottlepoint">Build Up Bottlepoint</a><br />*Recently, the leading citizens of Bottlepoint have brought to us their grievances. From what we make of their cacophonous complaints, they believe they are being sidelined by the other more mercantile cities of the League, and demand support to ensure they can keep their place. It is undoubtedly important to show them how much them and their craft is worth to us; as they say, the package makes half the gift.* | <li>86:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 6</li></ul><li>owns 86</li> | <li>86:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = wineport_bottlepoint_production</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="A16_dwarven_craftsmen">Dwarven Craftsmen</a><br />*The dwarves of Bottlepoint are one of the many parts to our commercial network. They have long been essential to keeping our fine wines like Rubenaire Red presentable and safe. Thus, there is no better place that can be considered another one of the founding cities of the League.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>small increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>86:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = wineport_core_city</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Build Up Bottlepoint](#A16_build_bottlepoint)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_unite_league">Unite the League</a><br />*Unification has long been the goal of the Wineport merchants, who have worked long and hard to bind the cities of the league closer together in harmony. Now, the time has finally come to assert our destiny as the leaders of the wine trade. We will centralize the league into a more cohesive political entity, and bring in the riches and glory that comes with it.* | <li>republican tradition is at least 100</li> | <li>add government reform = wineport_merchants</li> | [Protect Toarnaire](#A16_protect_toarnaire)<br />[International Recognition](#A16_recognition)<br />[Dwarven Craftsmen](#A16_dwarven_craftsmen)<br />[Minar Buyout](#A16_buyout_minar)<br />[The Fifth City](#A16_fifth_city)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_home_of_port">Home of Port</a><br />*Wineport and Foxalley were the two founding cities of the league.

| <a name="A16_organize_watchers">Organize the Watchers</a><br />*We are not the largest of realms, and our population is more comfortable as farmers, craftsmen, or traders rather than soldiers. So, it makes far more sense for our army to organize itself around mercenary companies. Many merchants already hire mercenaries to protect their shipments, and these forces have earned the nickname ‘The Wine Watchers’. We shall nationalize these Wine Watchers, and they will defend the land and the wine against all threats.* | <li>has estate privilege estate_adventurers_organization_licensed_adventurers</li> | <li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_wineport_watchers</li></ul><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_foxalley_foxes</li></ul> | [Home of Port](#A16_home_of_port)<br /> |

| <a name="A16_free_coast">Free the Coast</a><br />*For the good of all trade in Lencenor, and to preserve our new federation, we must secure all the ports of the Winebay. Last among them being Oldport. Now we shall go up against the Lorentish crown itself for our final prize on the path to mercantile control.* | <li>upper winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If upper bloodwine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Final Push](#A16_final_push)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_minar_missions">Gold, God, Good Wine</a><br />*Through our pact with the Priests of Minar, we have, at least in theory, some divine mandate for our wine collecting adventures. And they suggest we start with their legendary Minar’s Succor. Popular amongst the Esmari nobility, it is produced through a secret process by Minari priests across Cannor. We should try and centralize our control over its production and export to serve our aims.* | <li>97:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>primary culture is esmari</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>value is at least 50</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li> | [World of Winecraft](#A16_world_of_winecraft)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_sorncost_initiative">Sorncóst Initiative</a><br />*A dry wine from the south, Sorncósti wine is pleasant to drink in dry climates and alongside strong foods.

| <a name="A16_pearlywine">One Wine, Two Wine</a><br />*Pearl Vintage and Pearl Modern are the two most prestigious white wines on the market. One high and mighty, the other sociable and sweet, one pairing with seafood, the other desert; both grown in the lands of our rivals in Pearlsedge. We must have it.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>hre size is at least 1</li></ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>41:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>49:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>41:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>49:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li> | [Sorncóst Initiative](#A16_sorncost_initiative)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_roilsard_develop">Red Wine, Blue Wine</a><br />*Saloren Blue is a unique wine both for its blue color and its extremely woody taste. While not popular with many, it has its lovers across the world, and we must add this rare and special brand to our ever-growing portfolio.* | <li>eastern winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li> | [One Wine, Two Wine](#A16_pearlywine)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_winetide">The Winetide</a><br />*Wine making is an innovative art, always growing and changing, and the lands of Escann are proving this ever truer. With new varieties coming out of the formerly war-stricken land, especially produced by adventurous former Lorentish and Rósande nobility, the possibility for profit is near endless. So, we must play our cards right to have a hand in this new market.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>escann superregion:</li><ul><li>trade goods is wine</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 1</li><li>escann superregion:</li><ul><li>trade goods is wine</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>value is at least 200</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>If random province has superregion is escann superregion, and  has trade goods is wine, and  has owner has opinion has value is 200, and has opinion has who is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>If random province has superregion is escann superregion, and  has trade goods is wine, and  has owner has opinion has value is 200, and has opinion has who is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li> | [Red Wine, Blue Wine](#A16_roilsard_develop)<br /> |

| <a name="A16_protect_minar">Protect Minar</a><br />*While the Minaran Temple may not be the best friend of ours politically, we share a religious brotherhood between our peoples. Though more importantly, they are an enemy of the Wine Lords who covet its rich farmland. They have wisely agreed to join our league of cities. For fear of invasion by Eilísin they have submitted to our protection, in exchange for some ‘commercial advantages’. Soon, our pockets will be lined with temple gold, and we will have another ally to stand against Lorent and the Wine Lords.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Minaran Temple</li></ul><li>A10:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>guaranteed by is this nation</li><li>is in trade league with is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>owns 97</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier wineport_church_taxes for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A16_buyout_minar">Minar Buyout</a><br />*While Minar has been a great ally, we need to convince them to integrate closer into the League. Some coins in the right places, and promises of temple patronage from our merchants will not fall on deaf ears. Especially when most of them are public devotees of Minar themselves. Hopefully, they will be enough to convince Minar to give up its political independence within the League.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Minaran Temple</li></ul><li>A10:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>is not at war</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 150</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>owns 97</li></ul> | <li>If lower bloodwine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has exists is A10:</li><ul><li>A10:</li><ul><li>the event [The Minar Buyout - An Offer From Wineport](../events/the_minar_buyout_an_offer_from_wineport.md) happens</li></ul><li>add treasury = -150</li></ul> | [Protect Minar](#A16_protect_minar)<br /> |

| <a name="A16_hired_veterans">Hired Veterans</a><br />*There are many veterans of the Lilac Wars wandering around the cities and farms of the Bay of Wines these days. Most have little in the way of life skills, but years devoted to fighting. Let us give them a job, some pay, and paint a target for them. We want the city of Coruan, and these mercenaries will help us get it.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier wineport_mecenaries for 25 years</li> |  |

| <a name="A16_neglected_sister">Neglected Sister</a><br />*Madelaire is an extremely rich-tasting white wine, with a reputation amongst the Lorentish nobility. Though, it is not popular beyond these circles, earning a reputation with wine merchants as the “neglected sister”, about it not being worth transporting overseas. But now that the best wine merchants in Lorent control the city, we can change the destiny of this wine, and increase its popularity.* | <li>114:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 70</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>114:</li><ul><li>add local autonomy = 30</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = wineport_madalaire_dev_cost</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Integrate Eilísin](#A16_integrate_eilisin)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_bridgewine_trade">Bridgewine Trade</a><br />*The Vernmen prefer nothing more than a good Bridgewine. Brewed in a city of dwarves, elves, and adventurers, Bridgewine is a hearty and spicy wine that goes well with a large meat feast. Controlling its source, one way or another, would grant us more control over the global wine trade.* | <li>569:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is this nation</li><li>is in trade league with is this nation</li><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li> | [World of Winecraft](#A16_world_of_winecraft)<br /> |

| <a name="A16_crimson_red">Citadel Purple</a><br />*The citadel of Azka-szel-Azka is famous for two things: being a formidable mountain fortress, and being the brewing site of Citadel Purple. This fortified wine is made with sun dried grapes, producing a unique taste perfect for mixing with cheese and nuts. For this reason, as well as its considerable popularity with Sun Elf nobles, we must control it.* | <li>522:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>value is at least 100</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>dip is at least 6</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li> | [Busilari Fortified](#A16_busilari_fortified)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_liquid_sunlight">Liquid Sunlight</a><br />*Jaherian Sunlight is a sweeter cousin of Citadel Purple, made in a similar way using dried grapes, but its reputation is even more high and mighty than its cousin. The legendary wine's production process is secretive and slow, requiring long time periods in the sun to create. Guaranteeing Wineporter access to Jaherian Sunlight would be a great boon to our profits.* | <li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>trade goods is wine</li><li>culture is sun_elf</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>value is at least 100</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>the event [Liquid Sunlight - The Arrival](../events/liquid_sunlight_the_arrival.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If bulwar superregion has trade goods is wine, and  has owner has opinion has value is 100, and has opinion has who is ROOT:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>save global event target as = wineport_bulwar_contact</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Citadel Purple](#A16_crimson_red)<br /> |
| <a name="A16_illusive_chylys">The Illusive Chylys</a><br />*The rarest wine in any market may be Chylys wine.

If we could secure an import route, it would increase our profits even further.* | <li>deepwoods superregion:</li><ul><li>trade goods is wine</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul><li>manpower is at least 10</li> | <li>If random province has trade goods is wine, and  has superregion is deepwoods superregion:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>add spy network from:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = -50</li></ul></ul></ul><li>add manpower = -10</li><li>upgrade wineport wines = yes</li> | [Liquid Sunlight](#A16_liquid_sunlight)<br /> |
