| <a name="sugamber_lilac_wars_consolidate">Consolidate New Holdings</a><br />*Our borders have almost doubled in size with the end of the Lilac Wars and our conquest of Countsbridge, Gnollsgate, Irmathmus, and Hawkshot. Though of course a great boon to our ambitions as a nation, these new acquisitions will also take time to… convert to our way of thinking. We must quickly integrate and incorporate our new lands, lest the lions that circle our nation see us as easy prey.* | <li>410:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>411:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>315:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>913:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add adm power = -300</li></ul><li>410:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "faster_integration"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>411:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "faster_integration"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>315:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "faster_integration"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>913:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "faster_integration"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="sugamber_succession_resolved">Succession Issues Resolved</a><br />*The Lilac Wars and erratic succession preferences of Ewald II have left our nation lacking in legitimacy and clear recourse. We should attempt to resolve our succession issues as soon as possible so that we can move forward with clear hearts and minds.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sugamber_succession_resolved_trigger_tt</li><li>has country flag [had_sugamber_succession_war](../flags/had_sugamber_succession_war.md)</li></ul><li>is year is at least 1500</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier sugamber_undisputed_dynasty for 50 years</li> |  |
| <a name="sugamber_ascension">A Power Rises</a><br />*For far too long, the Borders have been split into petty kingdoms vying for a small piece of an insignificant pie. The tribal feuds of the old Milcori and Wexonards live on today in spirit, albeit in a more civilized facsimile within Anbennar. It is up to us to finally unite the region under our banner and forge a nation in the Borders that is able to stand on its own within the Empire. Sugamber will be ascendant!* | <li>total development is emperor</li><li>prestige is emperor</li> | <li>If has Z02 is vassal; and has Z02 has does not exist:</li><ul><li>add dip power = 200</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>vassalize = Z02</li></ul><li>If mountainway area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Succession Issues Resolved](#sugamber_succession_resolved)<br />[The Bisan Partition](#sugamber_bisan_partition)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_above_lions_den">Above the Lion’s Den</a><br />*Busilar, the Stone Lion, has long been a dagger pointed straight at our vulnerable backside. Though they sided with the Rose Party, same as us, their continued insistence at independence from Anbennar cannot be allowed to stand any longer. We must cross the Khenek and wrest from them their pathetic border castles.* | <li>mountainway area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If lorbet area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If hapiande area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Power Rises](#sugamber_ascension)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_into_lions_den">Into the Den</a><br />*With Mountainway under our control, the vulnerable lowlands are but a stone’s throw away. Let us strike into the very heart of Busilar and take the old capital of Hapaine for ourselves.* | <li>lorbet area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>hapiande area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If busilar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If busilari straits area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Above the Lion’s Den](#sugamber_above_lions_den)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_stone_lions_demise">Stone Lion’s Demise</a><br />*Our steady advance has succeeded, and the Busilari have been pushed to the brink. We shall end this farce with force: we must crush any resistance left on the mainland and topple their crumbling statues deep into the straits.* | <li>busilar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>busilari straits area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier sugamber_busilar_conquered for 20 years</li><li>365:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = 7300</li><li>power = 25</li><li>key = SUGAMBER_TRADE</li></ul></ul> | [Into the Den](#sugamber_into_lions_den)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_lion_tamed">The Lion Tamed</a><br />*From the peaks of the Khenek, to the vineyards of Hapaine and Jaher’s port, Busilar is finally ours. And Anbennar’s, of course. Now, it is time to push for the full integration of the Busilari people into the Empire. Once the region is fully secured and pacified, we shall never have to worry about land incursions from the south again, and can turn our undivided attention toward further securing the eastern border of Anbennar.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sugamber_lion_tamed_trigger_tt</li><li>businor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>area is isle_of_tef_area</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>area is khenak_area</li></ul></ul><li>is part of hre</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>businor region:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "faster_integration"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>add imperial influence = 10</li> | [Stone Lion’s Demise](#sugamber_stone_lions_demise)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_lionsbane">Lionsbane</a><br />*The twin lions of Salt and Stone must fall! If we are to truly be feared and respected as the defender and protector of the Borders, we must wipe from Cannor our rivals in the north and south. Sugamber must prove more than their match, and scatter the once-proud statues of these beasts to the winds of time.* | <li>prestige is at least 50</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is sugamber_lions_bane_trigger</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>A29:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>superregion is western_cannor_superregion</li><li>superregion  is escann_superregion</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>A72:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>superregion is western_cannor_superregion</li><li>superregion  is escann_superregion</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add ruler modifier:</li><ul><li>name = sugamber_lionsbane</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change mil = 2</li> | [The Lion Tamed](#sugamber_lion_tamed)<br />[Claim the Marquisate](#sugamber_claim_the_marquisate)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_wexonard_protector">Protector of the Wexonards</a><br />*Though our ascent may have been hand in hand thus far, only one of either us or Wex can truly lay claim as the representative and protector of the Wexonards in Anbennar. Unfortunately for Wex, our star shines brighter than theirs. Let us finally unite all the Alenic peoples in the Empire under one banner.* | <li>A30:</li><ul><li>is not the emperor</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Wex</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul><li>variable arithmetic trigger:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip is sugamber_dev_3_times_wex</li><li>export to variable:</li><ul><li>which is our_total_development</li><li>value is trigger_value:total_development</li></ul><li>export to variable:</li><ul><li>which is wex_total_development</li><li>value is trigger_value:total_development</li><li>Wex</li></ul><li>multiply variable:</li><ul><li>which is wex_total_development</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is our_total_development</li><li>which  is wex_total_development</li></ul></ul> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A30</li><li>type = cb_claim_throne_sugamber</li><li>months = 120</li></ul> | [Hegemony over Arannen](#sugamber_hegemony_over_the_arannese)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_twin_stars">Twin Stars of the Borders</a><br />*As the hinterlands of Anbennar, the Borders have long been neglected development wise compared to the more influential and populous areas of the Dameshead. This must change. What better way to progress than to move forward hand in hand with our Arannese brothers and pour resources into both our old capital of Rhinmond as well as the heart of Arannen?* | <li>919:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li></ul><li>904:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>919:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = sugamber_twin_stars_province</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>904:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = sugamber_twin_stars_province</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> | [As Above, so Below](#sugamber_integrate_arannese_people)<br /> |

| ----- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| <a name="sugamber_rose_party_allies">Rose Party Allies</a><br />*The Rose Party was a coalition of convenience more than anything for us, aimed at shattering the power that the ancient Silmunas wielded over Anbennar. We should aim to formalize some of these tenuous links into alliances that we can use to secure ourselves against our enemies.* | <li>alliance with is Wex</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>desc is sugamber_rose_party_allies_trigger_tt</li><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>has country flag [lilac_wars_rose_party](../flags/lilac_wars_rose_party.md)</li></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier sugamber_diplo_rep for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="sugamber_bisan_partition">The Bisan Partition</a><br />*The traitorous Bisan sided with the Moon party and fought against their Wexonard brothers in us and Wex in the Fourth Lilac War. Clearly, their rulers cannot be trusted to safeguard the interests of the people any longer. Could they not see that the shackles of the Silmunas had to be overthrown for the good of Anbennar? Together with Wex, we must free the Wexonards of Bisan, for their own good. Let us draft an ultimatum to their wayward ruler.\n§RThis may lead to an offensive war against Bisan!§!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Bisan</li><li>alliance with is Wex</li><li>A30:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>is not at war</li></ul><li>is not at war</li><li>statesman is at least 1</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Bisan</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is A34:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>the event [The Bisan Partition: An Ultimatum](../events/the_bisan_partition_an_ultimatum.md) happens</li></ul> | [Consolidate New Holdings](#sugamber_lilac_wars_consolidate)<br />[Ready for War](#sugamber_ready_for_war)<br />[Rose Party Allies](#sugamber_rose_party_allies)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_between_lions_maw">Between the Lion’s Maw</a><br />*Though our ambitions have brought us to war with both the circling lions in our midst, we will not falter. We are no cornered boar or trapped auroch, to fall so easily to even an entire pack of lions. Let them catch their jaws on the hard edge of our shields and feel the cold bite of our steel!* | <li>war with is Arannen</li><li>war with  is Busilar</li> | <li>country gets the modifier sugamber_lions_maw for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="sugamber_borders_secured">Secure our Borders</a><br />*With the coast secured, we must turn our attention toward securing our borders. Rhinmond, the heart of our lands, is far too exposed. We should buffer our homelands by taking the defensible hills of Antir Drop. The criers of Tellum also need to be dealth with, though their free city status in the Empire complicates matters. If we cannot conquer them by force without drawing the ire of the emperor, perhaps we can find a diplomatic solution.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>rhinmond area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Tellum</li><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Tellum</li><li>value is at least 190</li></ul><li>414:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>antir drop area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>If arannen area does not have country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Expand our New Coast](#sugamber_expand_coast)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_salt_lions_demise">Salt Lion’s Demise</a><br />*Our next natural target is the Marquisate of Arannen, nominally the protectors of the Borders. What outside threat have they protected Anbennar from recently, however, other than infrequent gnoll raids from the Folly? They should prove a fitting stepping stone in our rise.* | <li>arannen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>arannen area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "faster_integration"</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Secure our Borders](#sugamber_borders_secured)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_claim_the_marquisate">Claim the Marquisate</a><br />*Arannen - bequeathed the prestigious title of March of the Empire, sworn to protect Anbennar’s borders in the east, has finally fallen to our armies. They have shown that they are not fit as protectors of anything but their own graves. And as one power falls, another must rise to take its place. Let us petition the Emperor and claim the old title of Marquisate for ourselves, establishing Sugamber as the rightful protector of the Borders. * | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>A72:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>superregion is western_cannor_superregion</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>army size is emperor</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = sugamber_claim_the_marquisate_reward_tt</li><li>set country flag [is_a_marquisate](../flags/is_a_marquisate.md)</li><li>If has exists is A72:</li><ul><li>A72:</li><ul><li>clr country flag [is_a_marquisate](../flags/is_a_marquisate.md)</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If western cannor superregion has culture is arannese, and does not have country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Salt Lion’s Demise](#sugamber_salt_lions_demise)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_hegemony_over_the_arannese">Hegemony over Arannen</a><br />*With the title of Marquisate under our belt and the cultural center of Arannen under our control, we now have a strong claim over the rest of the Arannese people in the Borders.

| <a name="sugamber_invest_in_arannese_lands">Invest in Arannese Lands</a><br />*Isolated as us Wexonards are in Anbennar, it was inevitable that our expanding nation would run into the issue of the number of Anbennarians dwarfing us eventually. The Arannese make up a significant portion of our country now and cannot simply be ignored, lest we face a revolt we cannot handle. Let us show them that our interests align with theirs and keep them pacified by developing and building extensively in their lands.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>culture is arannese</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>If has monthly income is 50:</li><ul><li>add years of income = 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 500</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>904:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>413:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>420:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>417:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>322:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>411:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul><li>326:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 50</li></ul></ul> | [Hegemony over Arannen](#sugamber_hegemony_over_the_arannese)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_integrate_arannese_people">As Above, so Below</a><br />*Our overtures are bearing fruit! Though some nobles grumble still about our rule, it seems that the peasant populace cares naught for who rules over them, as long as they are left alone to do whatever it is peasants do. The Arannese certainly are not as bad as the pompous East Damerians and frivolous Esmari in any case. We should come to an accord with our Arannese subjects and fully integrate them into our nation.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 25</li><li>culture is arannese</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 10</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier sugamber_integrate_arannese until otherwise removed</li><li>add accepted culture = arannese</li> | [Invest in Arannese Lands](#sugamber_invest_in_arannese_lands)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_arannese_industry_sugamber_arms">Arannese Industry, Sugambrian Arms</a><br />*Turns out, the Arannese already have quite an innate sense of industrialness, what from their lacemaker cottages and such. Meanwhile, us Wexonards are experts with arms production and use, stemming from the control of our iron mines and our history with war. We should encourage the growth of both our industry and armies, for we can use the links between the two to strengthen relations between our peoples.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>culture is wexonard</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>culture is arannese</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier sugamber_arms_arannese_industry for 20 years</li> | [As Above, so Below](#sugamber_integrate_arannese_people)<br /> |
| <a name="sugamber_secure_the_south">Secure the South</a><br />*Look toward the South, across the calm waters of the Divenhal, and one shall see a sea plagued by pirates, corsairs, and smugglers alike who strike indiscriminately. We must safeguard our shores through heavy fortification and the building of defenses that will be able to deter any foe.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is businor_region</li><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>region is businor_region</li><li>has port</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier sugamber_south_secured for 50 years</li> |  |

Our traders and people will surely benefit from this recent acquisition. Still, the naval and port facilities at Irmathmas are severely lacking and will not serve our ambitions for long.

The ruins of Corveld and promise of unoccupied (by anything important, anyway) land have caught the eye of several of our neighbors, who even now send settlers deep into the marsh. Unluckily for them, we also have an eye on the Folly. Let them do the hard work for us.

The Borders are too much at the peripheral of the Empire to truly become a hotbed for this seemingly never ending renaissance, but at the same time, Sugamber cannot be allowed to fall behind.

And indeed, the city does not have much differentiating it from any other major one in the Borders. If we are to have a capital befitting our rising status, we must endeavor to build up industry and find a way to attract migrants.
