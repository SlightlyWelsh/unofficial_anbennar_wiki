It is from this crude fortress deep within the cold, foreboding Giantswood, the Frosthides will act as a buffer against attacks from the north.* | <li>741:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>741:</li><ul><li>rename capital = "Levilkh'aviktar"</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_frosthide</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Frosthide Tribe](#skurkokli_frosthide_resettled)<br /> |
| <a name="skurkokli_big_wall">Balgar's Big Wall</a><br />*The massive structure known as the White Wall is another marvel built by the dwarf, Balgar the Builder. It was impressive when we first laid eyes upon it, now with our additions, In Biighedli, or The Big Wall in the common tongue, is a wonder of the world.\n\nWe have reinforced the wall itself with heavy beams of iron and thick logs that are tied together, which run along its extensive breadth to help protect against siege weaponry. These improvements will funnel any would-be attackers toward the ogre-sized citadels that are dotted along the great structure. These looming bastions with mighty iron gates will impede any that would dare assault our inner heartlands.* | <li>756:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>754:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>850:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>860:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>865:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>874:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>830:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>756:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_big_wall_forts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>754:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_big_wall_forts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>850:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_big_wall_forts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>860:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_big_wall_forts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>865:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_big_wall_forts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>874:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_big_wall_forts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>830:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_big_wall_forts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = ogre_lose_devastation</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is west castanor region, and has region is inner castanor region, and has region is south castanor region:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -30</li></ul></ul> | [The Ogre Horde Settles](#skurkokli_the_ogre_horde_settles)<br />[Frosthide Fortress](#skurkokli_frosthide_fortress)<br /> |

However, it is not enough.

The sprawling metropolis is protected by layers of thick, tall walls each dotted with great towers that provide ample protection to any defensive force.\n\nHowever, the years have not been kind to the old fortifications, having been damaged by countless invasions, including our own, and by more mundane natural means. Rebuilding the walls of this fortified city, Kelaktar, will ensure that the Gorger Lord’s grand feasts will remain undisturbed, while also providing protection for the people of the horde.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li><li>region  is inner_castanor_region</li><li>region   is south_castanor_region</li></ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>value is at least 25</li></ul><li>833:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_castonath_kelaktar_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Ogretecture](#skurkokli_ogretecture)<br /> |
| <a name="skurkokli_feast_halls">The Feasting Halls</a><br />*The great city of Skurkolba is not only the seat of the Gorger Lord but is also home to the majority of our people. Though we loathe to say it, being in such close proximity to He Who Hungers only serves to worsen our already insatiable hunger. With the construction of the many Feasting Halls throughout the different sections of the city, the ogres of Skurkokli will be free of the hunger pains as we feast upon man and beast.\n\nAnother benefit of these halls aside from the promise of a full belly, is the fights that will break out during the feasts. Watching these tests of strength will allow us to select the strongest warriors to swell the ranks of the horde, and with ogres knowing that they can satiate their hunger at any time within the halls, they attract plenty of potential recruits.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li><li>region  is inner_castanor_region</li><li>region   is south_castanor_region</li></ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>833:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>832:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>831:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add treasury = -150</li><li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_castonath_kelaktar_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = skurkokli_castonath_kelaktar_1</li></ul></ul> | [Walls of Skurkolba](#skurkokli_walls_of_skurkolba)<br /> |

The tribes that have incorporated members of the Steelgrinders, one of the shattered seven clans renowned for their metalworking, have approached us with requests that we construct new and improved forges and smitheries within the Kelaktar of Skurkolba to support our warbands, and it would be wise of us to grant this request.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li><li>region  is inner_castanor_region</li><li>region   is south_castanor_region</li></ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul><li>833:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>development is at least 40</li><li>has building weapons</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add treasury = -150</li><li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_castonath_kelaktar_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = skurkokli_castonath_kelaktar_2</li></ul></ul> | [The Feasting Halls](#skurkokli_feast_halls)<br /> |

Ogres fill the streets of the city, moving their mass from one merchant stall to the next. These stalls are filled with goods from all over Cannor, and as the horde continues to expand in all directions more and more goods taken from the consumed find their way here.\n\nIt is thanks to the Gorger Lord’s bottomless hunger that has ensured that our trade routes to the city are free of banditry and harassment. Just Knowing you would find your honored place upon Rancor’s table if you were the one responsible for interrupting even one of his feasts is enough to keep even the most ardent of criminals in check.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li><li>region  is inner_castanor_region</li><li>region   is south_castanor_region</li></ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>833:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>development is at least 50</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul><li>840:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = skurkokli_castonath_kelaktar_4</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = skurkokli_castonath_kelaktar_3</li></ul></ul><li>832:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul> | [This Land is Our Land](#skurkokli_this_land_is_our_land)<br />[Ogrish Forges](#skurkokli_forges)<br /> |

The Wexonard, true to their Alenic heritage, fought bravely, though the outcome of the battle was inevitable. Their projectiles, whether from gun, crossbow, or cannon bounced harmlessly of the thick plating of the Ironclaw warriors, as they tore into the ranks of the humans with their hand-blades.\n\nWith Wexkeep now ours, we will hold a great feast here, devouring the humans, so that their bravery will become a part of our own warriors. In return for delivering such a feast, the Ironclaw will be granted ownership Wexkeep and have chosen to rename it to the Iron Citadel, Rk'narnktar, after their own tribe, and in honor of the iron will of the Wexonard people.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>wexhills area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>wexhills area:</li><ul><li>change culture = bloodtooth_ogre</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>306:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Rk'narnktar"</li><li>rename capital = "Rk'narnktar"</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Tribes of the Bloodtooth](#skurkokli_tribes_of_bloodtooth)<br /> |
