| <a name="A22_allies_of_necessity">Allies of Necessity</a><br />*After the Lilac Wars ended, we have found ourselves in a difficult situation. Being one of the last nations to change sides, mostly out of existential necessity, and being the last loyal nation in West Dameria we did not get the chance to gather friends amongst the Rose party members. Our old Damerian allies consider us traitors, unwilling to lay our lives down for the emperor, and the people who fought against us still remember how we saved a quarter of the imperial army in 1409. We cannot afford to dwell on the past however, stuck between two powerful neighbours we need to find common ground with at least one of them to have any chance to prosper in the ages to come.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Wesdam</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Pearlsedge</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = ALLIES_OF_NECESSITY_DESC</li><li>If has reverse has opinion has who is A04, and reverse has opinion has value is 150:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = A04</li><li>value = 25</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_connections_of_wesdam" for 10 years</li></ul><li>If has reverse has opinion has who is A11, and reverse has opinion has value is 150:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = A11</li><li>value = 25</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_pearlsedger_trade_deals" for 10 years</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A22_protectors_of_dameshead">Protectors of Dameshead</a><br />*Now that our job is laid before us, we need to start with the first step - convincing the emperor of how worthy our goal is. To make our job easier, we surely should have full control of the ports in the eastern Damesneck, allowing us full control over who comes into our waters.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is the emperor</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Neckcliffe</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_imperial_support" for 10 years</li><li>If eastneck area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has country modifier is neckcliffe pearlsedger trade deals, and  has A11 is the emperor:</li><ul><li>the event [The Napesbay Proposition](../events/the_napesbay_proposition.md) happens</li></ul><li>If has country modifier is neckcliffe connections of wesdam, and  has A04 is the emperor:</li><ul><li>the event [The Napesbay Proposition](../events/the_napesbay_proposition.md) happens</li></ul> | [Allies of Necessity](#A22_allies_of_necessity)<br />[Plight of the Marines](#A22_plight_of_the_imperial_marines)<br />[Rebuild the Imperial Navy](#A22_rebuild_the_imperial_navy)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_backhanded_blow">A Backhanded Blow</a><br />*Though our alliance with our neighbours has been useful, it is high time we made them pay for betraying the Empire. If we can snatch a few key places, furthering our control of Dameshead, all the better.* | <li>eastneck area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li> | <li>If damespearl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is A22; and does not have permanent claim is A22:</li><ul><li>11:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = A22</li></ul></ul> | [The Admiralty](#A22_neckcliffer_admirality)<br />[Protectors of Dameshead](#A22_protectors_of_dameshead)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_entrances_to_damesear">Entrances to Damesear</a><br />*Damesear is the most important part of the Empire of Anbennar with ships coming and going in the hundreds each day. Though many would like to claim a toll on these travellers, nobody is willing to protect them from those who mean them harm. Illegal slavers have always prayed on these travellers but never has it been as bad as it is now. If we are to properly protect them, we need proper staging grounds.* | <li>11:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If does not have core is A22; and does not have permanent claim is A22:</li><ul><li>9:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = A22</li></ul></ul> | [A Backhanded Blow](#A22_backhanded_blow)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_the_eastern_toll">The Eastern Toll</a><br />*Now that we are in position to properly protect the Damesear straits, we surely deserve to be reimbursed for our efforts. The Moonisle is a perfect place to set up an eastern toll for crossing both the strait and going around the isle.* | <li>9:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>9:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = neckcliffe_eastern_toll</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If silverwoods area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Entrances to Damesear](#A22_entrances_to_damesear)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_silverwood_navy">Silverwood Navy</a><br />*During the time of Dameria the most prized ships were made from the Silverwood, a unique kind of pine tree known for their durability and resistance to decay. Ever since Dameria fell, however, we havenâ€™t been able to get the elves of Moonhaven to sell any more to us. We have no other choice but to take control of the forest for ourselves if we want access to it.* | <li>silverwoods area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_silverwood_navy" until otherwise removed</li><li>If east damesear area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If west damesear area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Eastern Toll](#A22_the_eastern_toll)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_smothering_the_damesear">Smothering of Damesear</a><br />*With the control over anyone coming and going through the Damesneck we could in theory completely block the Damesear off from resources. This fact alone proves that we should take control over it for the good of the people there who won't ever have to suffer such a fate.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is east_damesear_area</li><li>area  is west_damesear_area</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_damesear_domination" for 20 years</li> | [Silverwood Navy](#A22_silverwood_navy)<br /> |

| <a name="A22_secure_source_of_lumber">A Source of Lumber</a><br />*One of our main difficulties is that, though our lands are fertile and plentiful, we lack the forests necessary for large scale shipbuilding. In times past we used to call upon the counts of Woodwell for our lumber needs but after Dameria fell the shipments have stopped. Whether we decide to take the forest for ourselves or renegotiate terms, lumber must flow down the Woodwell Gorge!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Woodwell</li><li>woodwell area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_lumber_shipments" for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A22_plight_of_the_imperial_marines">Plight of the Marines</a><br />*Since the formation of the Empire, it has maintained an elite armed group called 'The Imperial Marines'. They were trained in all things regarding naval warfare along the directions given by the Elves, well experienced in life at sea. Most of this army however has been wiped out together with the Imperial Navy and only a few veterans remain. Even worse, after Lothane of Wex became the emperor wages paid to these veterans have been cut, leaving them without work and goal. If we were to pay them, surely these well-trained warriors would join our cause and train our own marines.* | <li>years of income is at least 2.0</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li> | <li>add years of income = -2.0</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_imperial_marines" until otherwise removed</li> | [Rights to the Imperial Navy](#A22_imperial_navy_rights)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_neckcliffer_admirality">The Admiralty</a><br />*Our people have always been tied to the sea and thus so is our nobility. It is time to remind everyone of our ways by proclaiming the Admiralty of Neckcliffe - our Count being first and foremost the Imperial Grand Admiral and commander of the Imperial Fleet.* | <li>government reform progress is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li> | <li>change government reform progress = -100</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>add government reform = neckcliffer_admirality</li> | [Rebuild the Imperial Navy](#A22_rebuild_the_imperial_navy)<br />[Plight of the Marines](#A22_plight_of_the_imperial_marines)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_strongport_naval_academy">Academy of Strongport</a><br />*While Strongport is not a particularly important harbour, the sea near it is calm and ideal for the training of both sailors and officers. Its distance from the capital will allow these bright minds to study far from the political strife and focus on what is important. For this to work however we first need to expand the port to acceptable size and make sure that the students often hailing from nobility have anything they might need.* | <li>45:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has building university</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>45:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "neckcliffe_imperial_naval_academy"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Admiralty](#A22_neckcliffer_admirality)<br />[Protectors of Dameshead](#A22_protectors_of_dameshead)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_choke_the_neck">Choke the Neck</a><br />*With our recent efforts, the Damesneck is much safer. Pirates are no longer so daring. Our work in quelling them will, however, be for naught unless we can have full control of anyone passing through the Damesneck. We shall build grand naval batteries ready to sink any hostile ship approaching the heart of Anbennar.* | <li>24:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>50:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul><li>14:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>24:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = naval_battery</li><li>speed = 0.33</li><li>cost = 0.2</li></ul></ul><li>50:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = naval_battery</li><li>speed = 0.33</li><li>cost = 0.2</li></ul></ul><li>14:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = naval_battery</li><li>speed = 0.33</li><li>cost = 0.2</li></ul></ul><li>If pearlywine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tretunica area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If menibor loop area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If verne area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If wyvernmark area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If khenak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Backhanded Blow](#A22_backhanded_blow)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_no_more_pearls">No More Pearls</a><br />*For a while now, Pearlsedge harbours a grudge against us for taking the strategically important islands around the entrance to Dameshead, damaging both their pearl collecting operations and taking away the lucrative tolls on entering the sea. We cannot afford to leave such a security threat unmanaged. Furthermore, the Pearlsedgers are respectable sailors and under our leadership they would be a great boon to our navy.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Pearlsedge</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_westbank_hegemony" for 10 years</li><li>If does not have core is A22; and does not have permanent claim is A22:</li><ul><li>86:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = A22</li></ul></ul><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 20</li></ul> | [Choke the Neck](#A22_choke_the_neck)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_cork_the_bay">Cork the Bay</a><br />*Lorent is and has been a constant threat to the Empire since the first Lilac war. Though we might be no match for the might of their armies on land, they cannot hope to match us on the seas. Most of the Lorentish ports and important trade routes pass through the Bay of Wines. If we were to take control of its entrance, we could easily decide what we want to let pass.* | <li>86:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has building naval_battery</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>48:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has building naval_battery</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>86:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = neckcliffe_bay_tolls</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>48:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = neckcliffe_bay_tolls</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If venail area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [No More Pearls](#A22_no_more_pearls)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_protect_aelantir_trade">Protect Aelantir Trade</a><br />*The pirate threat might be gone but a new kind of treachery is threatening the seas. They call themselves privateers and often are sent with the blessing of their home nation to plunder ships coming back from Aelantir with riches. Though the Lament Ocean is too large for us to realistically patrol, we should take over the deserted island of VenÃ¡il and use it to secure as much of the route as possible. * | <li>venail area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>94:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>the event [Munas's Gaze](../events/munas_s_gaze.md) happens</li> | [Cork the Bay](#A22_cork_the_bay)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_prepare_the_legislature">Prepare Legislature</a><br />*Over the years we have seen what other imperial nations do with their navies and rarely is it something beneficial to everyone in the realm. We should propose a law which disallows member nations to have navies larger than a set limit, instead forcing them to rely on us.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>desc is neckcliffe_prepare_the_legislature.tooltip</li><li>all elector:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Neckcliffe</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 4</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_preparing_legislature" for 5 years</li> | [Smothering of Damesear](#A22_smothering_the_damesear)<br />[Protective Embrace](#A22_protective_embrace)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_launch_the_legislature">Launch the Legislature</a><br />*Our draft is finished and now we can propose it in the Imperial Diet. Should this work, we will be the only nation allowed to have a large standing navy as well as allow us to preemptively strike any nation that could pose a threat to us.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier neckcliffe_preparing_legislature</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is the emperor</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Neckcliffe</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>navy size is at least 20</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>num of colonists is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>navy size is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -300</li><li>the event [The Treaty of White Cliffs](../events/the_treaty_of_white_cliffs.md) happens</li> | [Prepare Legislature](#A22_prepare_the_legislature)<br /> |

| <a name="A22_sailmakers_of_stoneview">Sailmakers of Stoneview</a><br />*The region of Stoneview is renowned for its fields of flax. While in other places its linen is used to make cloth, the people of Stoneview use it to make sails. Sail making tradition is strong in the region though many masters have died in the Lilac Wars. The region could use help to keep this important tradition going strong and to provide us with the ever-necessary sails for our ships.* | <li>24:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_advanced_sails" for 50 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A22_imperial_navy_rights">Rights to the Imperial Navy</a><br />*Majority of the Imperial Navy burned before the Invasion of Damesear, together with many of our countrymen and our late count. The current emperor seems to have little interest in ships and as such we should be able to easily obtain rights to maintain the imperial navy as well as the few surviving ships.* | <li>27:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is the emperor</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of ports is at least 6</li><li>navy size is at least 20</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>27:</li><ul><li>add unit construction:</li><ul><li>type = heavy_ship</li><li>amount = 3</li><li>speed = 0</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> | [Sailmakers of Stoneview](#A22_sailmakers_of_stoneview)<br />[A Source of Lumber](#A22_secure_source_of_lumber)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_rebuild_the_imperial_navy">Rebuild the Imperial Navy</a><br />*Now that the Imperial Navy is legally within our hands, we should focus on immediately rebuilding it. The Empire is currently completely undefended from the sea, the Gnolls and pirates run rampant, coastal villages burn daily and innocents are quietly whisked away to slavery! This must not stand any longer. Neckcliffe shall be the aegis of the realm if nobody else shall!* | <li>num of heavy ship is at least 5</li><li>num of galley is at least 15</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_imperial_navy_reborn" for 10 years</li> | [Rights to the Imperial Navy](#A22_imperial_navy_rights)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_renovate_the_imperial_docks">Renovate the Imperial Docks</a><br />*At one point the Imperial Docks were the largest ocean worthy port of the empire. Since then, much has changed and nowadays places such as port Munas are larger and better maintained. This must not stand anymore. The state of the docks brings shame to the Imperial Fleet and to the nation as a whole!* | <li>27:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 10</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>27:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "neckcliffe_renovated_imperial_dock"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change trade goods = naval_supplies</li></ul> | [Rebuild the Imperial Navy](#A22_rebuild_the_imperial_navy)<br />[Plight of the Marines](#A22_plight_of_the_imperial_marines)<br /> |
| <a name="A22_navigate_the_lament_ocean">Navigate the Lament Ocean</a><br />*For generations now, weâ€™ve known of the lands of Aelantir far beyond the ocean.

| <a name="A22_a_daring_voyage">A Daring Voyage</a><br />*We have been considered the greatest sailors amongst the Damerians, perhaps in the Empire yet we have not achieved anything close to the elven prowess in their flight from Aelantir. To truly become known as the sole greatest seafarers we have to achieve a legend of our own. Let us send a fleet of ships to travel the oceans of the world and circumnavigate the globe coming back home.

| <a name="A22_wyverns_gulf">Wyvern's Gulf</a><br />*Though we were successful in making the coastline within the Dameshead safe, the Empire is large and the Divenhal coastline was left wide open. We must strike quickly and secure its most exposed part, in the Wyvern's bay.* | <li>291:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>290:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>288:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>286:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>283:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If busilari straits area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If isle of tef area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "neckcliffe_divenhal_entryway" for 10 years</li> | [Choke the Neck](#A22_choke_the_neck)<br /> |

| <a name="A22_eastern_islands">Eastern Islands</a><br />*Last unprotected Imperial coastline is in the eastern Borders.

| <a name="A22_throatport_counterfeit_coins">The Matter of Throatport</a><br />*Throatport is quite possibly the least reputable city in all of Anbennar. Built on the Woodwell Gorge, the town is split into two parts. The northern part is mostly safe and many a noble is known to live there. The south part, known as the Gutter is a sprawling labyrinthine slum, a den of thieves, prostitutes, and anyone else looking to break the law. Lately we have noticed large amounts of seemingly flawless Damescrown Crowns pop up out of nowhere. The problem is that instead of gold they are mostly lead. We have yet to managed to track the counterfeiters however.* | <li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is master_of_mint</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>ruler has personality is embezzler_personality</li></ul><li>dip is at least 3</li><li>26:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>26:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = neckcliffe_rampant_counterfeiters</li></ul> |  |
