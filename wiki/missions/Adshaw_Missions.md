| <a name="adshaw_the_huntsman">The Huntsman</a><br />*The court has long received word of a particular Woodsman deep in the Greatwoods. Described as silent, stoic, and overall mysterious, he's slain a host of werewolves and other such beasts, merely accepting payment from villages and rural lords before returning to the woods to continue his work. Though it seems this is not the limit of his capabilities; more discrete reports show several instances of rival lords taking each other into his grounds, ostensibly to hunt together and settle feuds, but only one returning, the mauled body of the other found years later. A man of his ability would be welcome in Rycastle, and with a few contacts and proper payments promised, we can bring him into our service.* | <li>mil power is at least 75</li><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add mil power = -75</li><li>add treasury = -50</li><li>define general:</li><ul><li>shock = 3</li><li>fire = 2</li><li>manuever = 6</li><li>siege = 3</li><li>name = "Berthold the Huntsman"</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="adshaw_reachspier_riots">Reachspier Riots</a><br />*Reachspier has long been a thorn in our side, extending Celmaldor's influence to both sides of our lordship. While they rule themselves as a republic, there are many nobles still reigning in its hinterland, with even more flooding in due to Bayvic's recent conquest of their lands north and east.\n\nIt wouldn't take much to bring them to rebellion: a few bribes, some promises of titles, and a couple agents implanted to whisper words of poison in their ears should be enough to turn them against the merchants. And when they do, we'll have forces ready to encourage the mayor to seek our protection, or the nobles themselves will turn the city over to us.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Reachspier</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>Z31:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>owns core province 704</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has Z31 has exists:</li><ul><li>Z31:</li><ul><li>the event [Reachspier Riots](../events/reachspier_riots.md) happens</li></ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Z31</li><li>value = -30</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 5</li></ul> | [Snake in the Bay](#adshaw_snake_in_the_bay)<br />[Cold to the Touch](#adshaw_cold_to_the_touch)<br /> |
| <a name="adshaw_lord_of_the_chills">Lord of the Western Chills</a><br />*The banner of Adshaw once again flies free over the frigid seas of the Bay of Chills, a sight that hasn't been seen since the elves landed in the west. With access to the sea obtained, this is a great step towards restoring Adshaw's rule over the Reach.* | <li>west chillsbay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If has Z30 is subject of is Z26:</li><ul><li>Z30:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>cede province = Z26</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has Z31 is subject of is Z26:</li><ul><li>Z31:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>cede province = Z26</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has Z32 is subject of is Z26:</li><ul><li>Z32:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>cede province = Z26</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has Z33 is subject of is Z26:</li><ul><li>Z33:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>cede province = Z26</li></ul></ul></ul><li>west chillsbay area:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li></ul><li>add prestige = 15</li> | [Reachspier Riots](#adshaw_reachspier_riots)<br />[Everwharf Incident](#adshaw_everwharf_incident)<br /> |

| <a name="adshaw_reachfleet">Reachfleet</a><br />*The most prominent threat to the Reach has always been the sea, or rather what lies beyond it. The reavers in the north have long pillaged and ravaged our coasts, and without a proper fleet and an admiral to lead it we have no way to defend against them. This weakness must be rectified, and an armada must be laid down with haste.* | <li>navy size percentage is at least 1</li> | <li>985:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = Z26</li></ul><li>define admiral:</li><ul><li>shock = 2</li><li>fire = 4</li><li>manuever = 3</li><li>siege = 4</li><li>name = "Armand Flint"</li></ul> | [Chillsbay Dockyards](#adshaw_chillsbay_dockyards)<br /> |

| <a name="adshaw_lone_spire">A Lone Spire</a><br />*Jutting out of the sea like a lance, the ancient Frost Giant spire known as the Giant's Manse is one of the most prominent landmarks in the Giant's Grave. For centuries it's been in the hands of the Northmen, an anchor from which they launch their raids on our people. Before we even think of invading Olavslund, the Giant's Manse must be seized.* | <li>owns core province 985</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>the event [The Manse Falls](../events/the_manse_falls.md) happens</li><li>985:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z26_mansedock</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>If has Z26 has religion is corinite:</li><ul><li>change religion = corinite</li></ul><li>Else if has Z26 has religion is ravelian:</li><ul><li>change religion = ravelian</li></ul></ul> | [Reachfleet](#adshaw_reachfleet)<br /> |

Now that the hard part is over, we can begin properly bringing the light to these barbarians, difficult as it may be.* | <li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>culture is olavish</li><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 200</li> | <li>add dip power = -200</li><li>add accepted culture = olavish</li><li>custom tooltip = adshaw_gerudian_priests</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is olavish, and  does not have owner religion:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z26_gerudia_missionaries</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul></ul> | [First Landing](#adshaw_first_landing)<br /> |
| <a name="adshaw_falahs_hill">Falah's Hill</a><br />*High in the Titan's Rest mountains lies the old home of the Skalds, since left abandoned with their enlightenment. Our priests have noted however, the tranquil beauty of the area. Secluded from the world and with a sprawling forest beneath it, Skaldol would be perfect for a temple devoted to Falah, who stood as one of the most worshipped deities amongst the Reachmen since the days of Castanor.* | <li>owns core province 976</li><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>976:</li><ul><li>has owner religion</li></ul> | <li>add years of income = -1</li><li>976:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Falahyl"</li><li>add province triggered modifier = Z26_falahite_temple</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = falahite_temple_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If does not have 976 has tax building trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>976:</li><ul><li>add building = temple</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Taming the Olavish](#adshaw_taming_the_olavish)<br /> |

| <a name="adshaw_cradle_of_the_reach">Cradle of The Reach</a><br />*Noble Rycastle, once a lordly fortress harried by danger at all times, has now long been a safe haven within the empire. The comforting hearth of House Adshaw, much of the family still spends their childhood within its walls, far from the intrigues of Ryganced and surrounded by relics of their ancestor's glories and struggles alike. Despite this, it hasn't been expanded or renovated in quite some time, and many within the family have petitioned the emperor to do so.* | <li>years of income is at least 2</li><li>731:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add years of income = -2</li><li>731:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z26_rycastle_palace</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |

Through our rise it has only grown in prominence, standing as one of the greatest cities in the world, rivalled only by the likes of Castonath, Anbenncóst, and Lorentainé.\n\nWe shall surpass them all, to show all Halann that our empire is the grandest that has ever graced her lands, and our capital the shining jewel in our crown.* | <li>695:</li><ul><li>development is at least 70</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building fort_17th</li><li>has building  fort_18th</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has building trade_depot</li><li>has building  stock_exchange</li></ul><li>has building cathedral</li></ul> | <li>695:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z26_capital_of_the_reach</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li></ul> | [Cradle of The Reach](#adshaw_cradle_of_the_reach)<br /> |

| <a name="adshaw_frosty_reception">A Frosty Reception</a><br />*To our east lies the lordship of Frostwall. In better times it stood as a fortress overlooking the more prosperous cities along the coast, protecting the ports of the kingdom. Now though, it is but a simple lordship ruled by a young fool of a lord and subject to the whims of Bayvic's merchants. We may be able to use this to our advantage however, Lord Coreg seems to be utterly infatuated with a member of our house. By betrothing them and forging closer bonds, we can gain his trust and gratitude, a first step in reclaiming our rightful territory.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Z33:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>marriage with is Frostwall</li><li>Z33:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Adshaw</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>Z33:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>owns 706</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has Z33 has exists, and Z33 is not subject:</li><ul><li>Z33:</li><ul><li>define heir:</li><ul><li>claim = 75</li><li>dynasty = "Frostwall"</li><li>no consort with heir = yes</li></ul><li>define consort:</li><ul><li>country of origin = Z26</li><li>dynasty = "Adshaw"</li><li>culture = old_alenic</li><li>female = yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 5</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="adshaw_cold_to_the_touch">Cold to the Touch</a><br />*Coreg and his beloved have already managed to produce a child, a scion of our family within the walls of Frostwall. Our courts have grown close, and many within the Frostwaller aristocracy have discussed the merits of the lordship becoming our vassal. However, while Coreg remains on their throne, backed by Bayvicman crowns, they will never fully submit.

| <a name="adshaw_everwharf_incident">Everwharf Incident</a><br />*The distinctive warships of Everwharf, maroon hulled and yellow sailed, are a common sight in the Bay of Chills. They patrol the bay, relentlessly hunting pirates and reavers to keep it clear for merchants. They have been known to be particularly zealous however, on more than one occasion an Everwharfer ship has attacked a reputable trademan, believing they were Gerudian raiders. With the Graytide in the east they've been even more on edge.\n\nIt wouldn't be too difficult to disguise some of our vessels and order them to sink a few others, all within sight of the city and some particularly attentive eyewitnesses. With such an attack on our sovereignty sighted and spoken about, it would only be right for us to demand justice from Everwharf.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Everwharf</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>1256:</li><ul><li>light ships in province is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>Z30:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>owns core province 722</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has Z30 has exists:</li><ul><li>1256:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = Z26</li><li>type = light_ship</li><li>amount = 2</li></ul></ul><li>Z28:</li><ul><li>the event [The Everwharf Incident](../events/the_everwharf_incident.md) happens</li></ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Z30</li><li>value = -30</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 5</li></ul> | [Cold to the Touch](#adshaw_cold_to_the_touch)<br />[Deed to Dinesck](#adshaw_deed_to_dinesck)<br /> |
| <a name="adshaw_an_offer">An Offer</a><br />*A few years ago the Adshaw court was approached by a destitute merchant from Celmaldor by the name of Derek Deland. His family, formerly influential fabric traders in the city, had fallen on hard times. He was of no use at the time, and sent away, however he seems to have found success advising the buffoon currently sitting on Gawed's throne, becoming quite influential and wealthy within the kingdom.\n\nThough he may still hold resentment towards us for our rejecting him, we may be able to appeal to his hatred of Celmaldor to secure funding for our activities, as well as guaranteed peace with Gawed for a few years. He and his family will be expecting repayment at some point of course, either in crowns or the return of their properties in Celmaldor, but we'll deal with that when the time comes.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>A13:</li><ul><li>has country modifier gawed_deland_council</li></ul></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Gawed</li><li>value is at least 25</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Everwharf</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>add truce with = A13</li><li>country gets the modifier adshaw_deland_loan for 20 years</li><li>If has A13 has country modifier is gawed deland council:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = A13</li><li>value = -25</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have country modifier is gawed deland council:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Z30</li><li>value = -50</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Deland Debt](../events/deland_debt.md) happens</li></ul> |  |

It would only take a stray shot from either side to trigger war.

Nevertheless, the famed Knights of the Serpent have guarded the Reach from northern invasion since their founding in the wake of Nichmer's war. None in the land can match them when it comes to traversing difficult terrain or leading a charge.
