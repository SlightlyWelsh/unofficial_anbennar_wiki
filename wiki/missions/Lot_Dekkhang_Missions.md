Large slums where tax collectors get killed, the law does not reach, and harimari, hobgoblin, and human gangs fight for territories and extort the locals of what little coin they have.\n\nThe gangs do not merely control people’s lives, they control their livelihoods. A craftsman does not work, a merchant does not trade, without paying coin to the local gang (or a handful thereof). It is their steel that is most visible, but their stranglehold on commerce most pernicious. By establishing a centralized and well-guarded market, along with the roads necessary to get there and a guard-force to protect its trade from the gangs, we will end this invisible tax on every piece of our citizens’ lives.* | <li>treasury is at least 20</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>owns core province 4941</li><li>4941:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -20</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>medium increase of hobgoblin tolerance effect = yes</li><li>small increase of harimari tolerance effect = yes</li><li>4941:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 4</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add hobgoblin minority size effect = yes</li><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4941:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 25</li></ul><li>If is institution enabled is renaissance, and  is lacking institutions:</li><ul><li>4941:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = renaissance</li><li>value = 30</li></ul></ul></ul> |  |

We have approached the Dishonoured, who could perhaps turn the gangs of hobgoblins from a liability into a weapon. The new plan is to draft them into a new mercenary company, supervised by Daulophs and Dishonoured veterans, away from the city.
