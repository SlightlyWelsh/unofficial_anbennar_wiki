| <a name="feiten_port_facilities">Rebuilding our Fleet</a><br />*Ping Shuang's rebellion has left our once-proud fleet in shambles. Not only did the dread pirate queen make off with half our fleet, she even set much of the port district aflame as a parting gift! Out of the ashes, we must rebuild. The first step must be to restore Feiten's infrastructure and shipyards to use.* | <li>4879:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier feiten_port_facilities_built for 20 years</li><li>4879:</li><ul><li>add unit construction:</li><ul><li>type = light_ship</li><li>amount = 5</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="feiten_dual_harbors">Lungs of Commerce</a><br />*With Feiten started on the long road to recovery and Cuihiok pacified, now it is time to learn from the mistakes of the past and look to the future. First, we must ensure that the harbours are fully protected and secure. And once we are confident in their unassailability, we must build better facilities and marketplaces for our merchants.* | <li>4884:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>any neighbor province:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>any neighbor province:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>province trade power is at least 25</li></ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>province trade power is at least 25</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 3</li><li>custom tooltip = feiten_dual_harbors_effect_tt</li><li>If has dlc is "Dharma", and  has 4879 has province has center of trade of level is 2; and  has 4884 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>add mercantilism = 3</li></ul><li>Else if does not have dlc is "Dharma"; and  has 4879 has province trade power is 25; and  has 4884 has province trade power is 25:</li><ul><li>add mercantilism = 3</li></ul><li>If has dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>If has 4879 has province has center of trade of level is 2; and  has 4884 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>random list:</li><ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has 4879 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has 4884 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If has 4879 has province trade power is 25; and  has 4884 has province trade power is 25:</li><ul><li>random list:</li><ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul><li>1:</li><ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has 4879 has province trade power is 25:</li><ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has 4884 has province trade power is 25:</li><ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_dual_harbors</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Rebuilding our Fleet](#feiten_port_facilities)<br />[Gateway to the Jungle](#feiten_integrate_cuihiok)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_coast_blooms">The Coast Blooms</a><br />*The lifeblood of Feiten may be the trade that our harbours and ports bring in, but we cannot neglect the rest of the League either. The many villages and towns sat within the hills and cliffsides of the Jellyfish Coast must be made to share in our prosperity, if only to keep their commitment to the League strong.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 6</li><li>sea zone:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 1371</li></ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>iongsim area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 3</li><li>add republican tradition excess to mana effect:</li><ul><li>VAL = 10</li></ul> | [Lungs of Commerce](#feiten_dual_harbors)<br /> |

| <a name="feiten_haichapha">Support our Diokzatgun</a><br />*Our merchants and trade ships are going further afield and carrying larger cargoes than ever before, which brings the problem of a corresponding uptick in piracy and corsairs looking to follow in the wake of the now-legendary Ping Shuang. Our Diokzatgun, specialized pirate hunters, do much to combat these constant threats, but as they only recruit from a limited pool of vetted Feiten citizens, their resources are spread too thin. Invest some of our profits back into supporting our Diokzatgun with better ships, more advanced armaments, and coastal defenses, and we can pound the pirates into submission.* | <li>num of heavy ship is at least 5</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>has port</li><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = fulfill_conditions_prov_tt</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_anti_piracy_support</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has coast defense building trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_anti_piracy_support</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Hinterlands no Longer](#feiten_a_new_trading_power)<br />[The Coast Blooms](#feiten_coast_blooms)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_staging_grounds">Staging Grounds</a><br />*Explorations to the north and south, probing around the storm, have revealed many new islands. Many, if not most, of these are rocky, wind-blasted hellscapes at risk of being drowned at any second, but there are some that seem hold promise as forward whaling bases or as resupplying bases for our ships. If we can build up infrastructure and develop these islands up, we can make great use of them yet.* | <li>6512:</li><ul><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gold</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>6147:</li><ul><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gold</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>6512:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = fish</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_whaling_base_bountiful</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>6147:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = fish</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_whaling_base_bountiful</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Storm Boundaries](#feiten_mapping_storm_boundaries)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_gateways">Gateway to the World</a><br />*More than ever, the fortunes of Feiten are carried on ocean waves and skyward currents. Whether serving on whaling boats bound for distant shores, or serving on balloons and carried by the vagrancies of the wind, all funnel through Feiten itself or our southern harbour of Cuihiok. Our facilities in these cities are starting to be strained past their breaking point - we must ensure that they do not fail as we continue to discover new lands for our people to our east.* | <li>4879:</li><ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>province trade power is at least 30</li></ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>province trade power is at least 30</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>continent is north_america</li><li>continent  is south_america</li></ul></ul><li>has institution new_world_i</li></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = navigator</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.5</li></ul><li>4879:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_gateways_to_the_world</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_gateways_to_the_world</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Staging Grounds](#feiten_staging_grounds)<br /> |

| <a name="feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil">Of Bird Guano and Whale Oil</a><br />*The primary thing we look for when exploring the ocean-past-the-storm are islands that can work as whaling stations - islands with a sheltered bay, wood for repairs, and ample freshwater and animals for meat. Failing those, the islands almost always teem with seabirds, who cover the rocks with many feet of their droppings.\n\nMany of the older farmers amongst the Jellyfish Coast know well the value of bird and bat droppings as fertilizer, having taken advantage of seabird nesting sites amongst the pocked cliffs and caves of the Coast since the days of their forefathers. The nearby deposits have been running low as our people coax life out of the Jellyfish Coast's poor soil, but every new island layered with guano is another boon for us.* | <li>has discovered is at least 2063</li> | <li>create colony mission reward:</li><ul><li>province = 2063</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>2063:</li><ul><li>add colonysize = 400</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil_effect_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every province is an island, and  is not city:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = feiten_island_colonization_handler</li></ul></ul> | [Settler Policy](#feiten_determine_settler_policy)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_aelantir_ambitions">Aelantiri Markets</a><br />*Far past the eternal storm and guano islands lies a vast, new frontier: Aelantir. But we are far from the first to discover this new land. Local "Ruinborn" form pockets of civilization across much of the new continents, while the Cannorians have already staked their claim to much of the remaining land, having approached from other side of Aelantir well before we did.\n\nBoth groups require trade, of course, for trade is the lifeblood of civilization, and our balloons are positioned to take full advantage of this.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 190</li></ul><li>total development is at least 150</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 25</li></ul></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>continent is south_america</li><li>continent  is north_america</li></ul></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>all province:</li><ul><li>has province modifier feiten_skyport_handler_mod</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>continent is north_america</li><li>continent  is south_america</li></ul></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>continent is north_america</li><li>continent  is south_america</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>gives military access to is this nation</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>trust:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier feiten_aelantir_ambitions for 50 years</li> | [Of Bird Guano and Whale Oil](#feiten_of_guano_and_whale_oil)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_secrets_of_the_precursors">Secrets of the Precursors</a><br />*Hidden deep within overgrown jungle, crushed under the weight of centuries of continual construction and destruction, half submerged under the ocean and battered by the tides - Aelantir is a wealth of Precursor ruins and artifacts. Ever since the density of these relics in Aelantir was discovered, the Shuimu Engineering Cadre have been at the forefront of pushing us to take advantage of them for whatever research and development they cook up in their facilities. If Precursor Relics can truly push our inventions and technology as far as the Cadre claims, we would be fools not to invest as much as we can into their extraction.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trading part:</li><ul><li>trade goods is precursor_relics</li><li>value is at least 0.25</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>trade goods is precursor_relics</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = feiten_secrets_of_the_precursors_effect_tt</li> | [Aelantiri Markets](#feiten_aelantir_ambitions)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_the_foreign_quarter">The Foreign Quarter</a><br />*More and more Cannorians sail their way eastward in search of the exotic riches of Haless, many of them looking to establish permanent bases and trading posts. Through establishing special trading zones and privileged areas for them in our cities, we can make sure that their products flow through us first, instead of our rivals. Cuihiok would be the perfect city for one of these locations, at the heart of the coveted tea trade - we must do all we can to support the fledgling community of Cannorians there.* | <li>4884:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building stock_exchange</li><li>has building  trade_depot</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1000</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = feiten_the_foreign_quarter_effect_tt_1</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier feiten_foreigners_contained for 20 years</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = feiten_the_foreign_quarter_effect_tt_2</li><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier feiten_foreigners_welcomed for 20 years</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has statists are in power:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier feiten_foreigners_welcomed for 20 years</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier feiten_foreigners_contained for 20 years</li></ul></ul><li>4884:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = feiten_foreigners_quarter</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The League in Schism](#feiten_league_in_schism)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_advent_of_unraveling">Advent of Unraveling</a><br />*The influx of Cannorians in our cities has come with an unintended side effect - the slow spread of Cannorian philosophies and religions into our own populace. The gnomes of the Gommo had little interest in doing so, preoccupied as they were with science and scholarship alone, but many of the Cannorians are of the proselytizing Corinite or Ravelian type. Ravelianism in particular has taken hold in many former followers of High Philosophy. The Ravelian focus on gaining knowledge and figuring out the mysteries of the world also resonates with many of our Cadre members as well.\n\nMany of [Root.Monarch.GetName]'s advisors and friends who have converted are imploring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to at least hear out one of the missionaries when they come on a visit. Perhaps they have a point?* | <li>is religion enabled is ravelian</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is ravelian</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>all neighbor country:</li><ul><li>religion is ravelian</li><li>council position is harsh</li></ul></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>religion is ravelian</li><li>council position is harsh</li></ul></ul> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Silken Council Dissent](../events/silken_council_dissent.md) happens</li><li>the event [A Mutiny Aboard](../events/a_mutiny_aboard.md) happens</li><li>the event [A Ravelian Society in [4884.GetName]?](../events/a_ravelian_society_in_4884_getname.md) happens</li><li>the event [High Philosophy's New Home?](../events/high_philosophy_s_new_home.md) happens</li><li>the event [[feiten_converting_colony.GetName] converts to Ravelianism!](../events/feiten_converting_colony_getname_converts_to_ravelianism.md) happens</li></ul><li>If has any ally has religion is ravelian, and any ally has council position is harsh:</li><ul><li>If random ally has religion is ravelian, and  has council position is harsh:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>skill = 3</li><li>type = inquisitor</li><li>religion = ravelian</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.25</li><li>culture = PREV</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has any neighbor country has religion is ravelian, and any neighbor country has council position is harsh:</li><ul><li>If random neighbor country has religion is ravelian, and  has council position is harsh:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>skill = 3</li><li>religion = ravelian</li><li>type = inquisitor</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.25</li><li>culture = PREV</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>skill = 3</li><li>religion = ravelian</li><li>type = inquisitor</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.25</li><li>culture = anbenncoster</li></ul></ul><li>set ruler religion = ravelian</li><li>change religion = ravelian</li> | [The Foreign Quarter](#feiten_the_foreign_quarter)<br /> |

| <a name="feiten_integrate_cuihiok">Gateway to the Jungle</a><br />*The long war with Zyujyut may have left our fleet in shambles, but we were able to wrest the port of Cuihiok from the jungle savages, at the very least. Cuihiok sits at the river mouth that is the gateway into the tea jungle, and as such, full control over it is incredibly important for our trade ambitions in the area.\n\nThose dreams lie in the future, however, for now its populace is rebellious and our grasp tenuous - something that we must work to resolve.* | <li>4884:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>4884:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>hungngon area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>wanglam area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4984:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4982:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="feiten_into_the_tea_forest">Into the Jungle</a><br />*Though we now own Cuihiok, Zyujyut still controls the jungles, and by extension, the land's tea production. Feiten's longstanding enmity with Zyujyut means that our traders and merchants face quite an unwelcoming environment when attempting to tap into the tea trade, a hostility that cannot be assuaged by even the largest sums of money that we can offer.\n\nThey leave us no choice: we must enter the jungle ourselves.* | <li>hungngon area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>wanglam area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4984:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4982:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 10</li></ul> | [Gateway to the Jungle](#feiten_integrate_cuihiok)<br /> |

| <a name="feiten_chasing_whale_migrations">New Whaling Grounds</a><br />*Every year, as the spring thaw turns hill snow into rivulets of sparkling crystal, the citizens of Feiten wave goodbye to their husbands and sons, watching them sail into the horizon atop the wooden beasts that are their whaling boats. Everyone in Feiten knows that the start of spring is the best time for whaling, for that is when the whales migrate from their winter seas back up north to their summer feeding seas. Usually, within a cycle or two of the moon, most of the whalers would have come back with their holds full of catch.\n\nIn recent years, the whalers have been returning later and later, and oftentimes with hold half empty. Clearly, the old hunting grounds have been tapped out. We cannot let the whaling industry falter - we must find new fisheries, and quick!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>full idea group is exploration_ideas</li><li>dip power is at least 300</li></ul><li>sailors percentage is at least 0.90</li> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Whaling: Collapse of the Coastal Fisheries](../events/whaling_collapse_of_the_coastal_fisheries.md) happens</li></ul><li>define explorer:</li><ul><li>shock = 2</li><li>fire = 2</li><li>manuever = 6</li><li>trait = accomplished_sailor_personality</li></ul><li>add sailors = -5000</li><li>If does not have full idea group is exploration ideas:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -300</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier feiten_chasing_whale_migrations for 20 years</li> | [Hinterlands no Longer](#feiten_a_new_trading_power)<br /> |
| <a name="feiten_mapping_storm_boundaries">Storm Boundaries</a><br />*For as long as our fishermen and sailors can remember, there has been a massive storm to our east. The storm consumes all, stretching its claws beneath the churning sea foam and rising up to swallow the very stars themselves. Local tales say that the storm will one day tire of its feast and start westward to flood the world in its entirety.\n\nTales of a more... suspicious age, of course - we know better, for every philosopher and wise-man knows that the world is round, and so the storm must peter out at some location.

The simple whale fat candle, to an engineered cradle with flame control. Finally, add a bamboo basket underneath - and the paper lantern has been transformed into what we have affectionately dubbed a Shuimu, or a Jellyfish Balloon, for how the flame luminesces as it refracts through the sheer envelope.\n\nA simple set of steps, perhaps, but going from the first prototype to this has been a long and difficult process. For now, the technology is young, barely able to carry the weight of a single adolescent, but what limitless potential! Untethered by the tug of gravity and floating through the vast oceans of the sky, the Shuimu Balloons are a fascination to all of Feiten, and rightly so. Some advisors have even started to come forth with the idea of using them to scout, a natural use of the visibility and range advantage of these balloons.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier feiten_starting_balloon_research</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has mil advisor 2 yes</li><li>mil is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>the event [Launch of Jellyfish Scouts](../events/launch_of_jellyfish_scouts.md) happens</li><li>If has dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>change innovativeness = 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 60</li><li>add dip power = 60</li><li>add mil power = 60</li></ul> | [First Foray into the Skies](#feiten_first_foray_into_the_skies)<br /> |

Balloons, however, do not tire as harpies do, do not require sustenance as harpies do, and can carry much high loads than harpies can, opening up an ocean of possibilities.\n\nThere are two major schools of thought championed by the Shuimu Engineering Cadre as our designs improve and balloons get more and more integrated into our forces - that of overwhelming firepower from above, and that of lightning fast army movement and flexibility.* | <li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.4</li><li>dip power is at least 300</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [feiten_airfleet_captain_unlocked](../flags/feiten_airfleet_captain_unlocked.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = feiten_developing_an_air_doctrine_effect_tt_1</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = feiten_airfleet_admiral</li><li>female = yes</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.5</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = feiten_developing_an_air_doctrine_effect_tt_2</li><li>If has army professionalism is 0.4:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -150</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -300</li></ul><li>the event [Choosing an Air Doctrine](../events/choosing_an_air_doctrine.md) happens</li> | [Entrenching the Cadre](#feiten_entrenching_the_artificers)<br /> |
