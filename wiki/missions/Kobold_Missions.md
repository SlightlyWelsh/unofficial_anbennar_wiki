| <a name="KOB_control_the_greenscale_lands">Control the Greenscale</a><br />*The lands of the Greenscales, isolated from the rest of the kobold lands by the Sea of Broken Ice, is of vital importance to any united kobold state, commanding the trade routes between Gerudia and Lencenor.

| <a name="KOB_connection_to_the_dragon_coast">Connection to the Dragon Coast</a><br />*The Moormen have long made forays into the Dragon Coast, splitting our people between those in the Dragon Coast proper and the Greenscales to the north.

| <a name="KOB_prepare_for_the_storm">Prepare for the Storm</a><br />*Though we will face many a foe in unifying the coast, we will surely face an even larger one beyond it; a great storm is coming, of humans, elves, halflings, and worse, gnomes. We must be ready for them.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.75</li><li>is year is at least 1450</li> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="KOB_conflicts">Kobold Conflict</a><br />*For centuries, the Dragon Coast has been divided amongst the three great kobold tribes: the Redscales, Bluescales, and Greenscales. We, however, are clearly the worthiest of the three tribes, and must muster our forces, in order to unite the Dragon Coast under our rightful rule.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.75</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.95</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = kobold_conflicts_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If dragonpoint area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dragondowns area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dragonspine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dragonheights area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dragondepth area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If coddorran heights area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>170:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>694:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="KOB_control_the_bluescale_lands">Control the Bluescale</a><br />*The lands of the Bluescales, holding the vast mountains of the Dragon Coast, are of vital economic, cultural, and religious significance.

| <a name="KOB_unify_the_clans">Unify the Clans</a><br />*It is done. All the lands of the kobold people, so long divided, have been united under our rule. However, many of our fellow kobolds see us not as unifiers, but as conquerors. We must show them that we are not Red nor Green nor Blue; we must unify the clans, and in doing so, unify the people.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>stability is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add adm power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier kobold_unified_clan for 50 years</li> | [Control the Bluescale](#KOB_control_the_bluescale_lands)<br />[Control the Greenscale](#KOB_control_the_greenscale_lands)<br />[Control the Redscale](#KOB_control_the_redscale_lands)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_end_the_gnomish_hierarchy">End the Gnomish Hierarchy</a><br />*Though we expelled their ilk more than a thousand years ago the Gnomish Hierarchy still persists on the isle of Nimscodd and have remained a threat to our lands since that day. We must take to the seas, destroy their island fortresses, and end the gnomish menace once and for all. Only then, will kobolds be free to carve their own path.* | <li>storm isles area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>nimscodd area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Nimscodd</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier kobold_nimscodd_end for 25 years</li><li>126:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Control the Pass](#KOB_control_the_pass)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_exterminate_the_gnome">Exterminate the Gnomes</a><br />*Though the Hierarchy has been defeated, the gnomes have not. To the south, the city of Portnamm still throngs with our ancient foe; and as long as it remains we cannot truly sleep soundly. We will end the gnomish threat, no matter the cost.* | <li>126:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>126:</li><ul><li>change culture = ROOT</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add devastation = 25</li></ul> | [End the Gnomish Hierarchy](#KOB_end_the_gnomish_hierarchy)<br /> |

| <a name="KOB_expand_our_religion">Expand our Religion</a><br />*The great faith of the Dragonfather has always been decentralised in nature, with various sects and cults around the coast. We must expand it, and centralise it into a proper state religion. For, what else but a powerful faith could be the will of Malliath?* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kobold_pious for 35 years</li> | [Brandish The Storm](#KOB_brandish_the_storm)<br /> |

| <a name="KOB_control_the_redscale_lands">Control the Redscale</a><br />*The lands of the Redscales, in the south of the Dragon Coast, contain by far the most fertile land in the region. If our people are to rise to become a true nation, it must be able to feed itself, and for that, the lands of the Redscales are vital.* | <li>dragonpoint area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>dragondowns area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>170:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kobold_redscale_wrath for 25 years</li> | [Kobold Conflict](#KOB_conflicts)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_control_the_pass">Control the Pass</a><br />*Though we have united much of the coast, our work is far from over. Our ancient rival, the Gnomish Hierarchy, still holds lands to our south, in the so-called Gnomish Pass. If we are to secure for ourselves this kobold state, we must expel the gnomes from the mainland once and for all.* | <li>gnomish pass area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If nimscodd area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If storm isles area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If reaver coast area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If iochand area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have province id is 126:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add prestige = 10</li> | [Control the Redscale](#KOB_control_the_redscale_lands)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_defeat_reveria">Defeat Reveria</a><br />*To our south, the Reverians remain a threat. Whether as greedy conquerors seeking to take our lands or greedy mercenaries for gnomes, the Reverians have become nothing but a tall gnome! For the good of koboldkind, they must be destroyed.* | <li>reaver coast area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>129:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>141:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>142:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>143:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If dragonhills area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Control the Pass](#KOB_control_the_pass)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_conquer_the_dragon_hills">Conquer the Dragonhills</a><br />*Though we have secured the coast, the eagle-kings of Gawed loom to the east. They could all too easily strike and cut our newly forged nation into pieces, so we must push into the foothills to keep them at bay.\n\nConveniently, they have a fortified town at Eaglecrest we can use, which is long overdue for a reckoning for its hideous local traditions.* | <li>213:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [The End of Eaglecrest](../events/the_end_of_eaglecrest.md) happens</li><li>add prestige = 10</li> | [Defeat Reveria](#KOB_defeat_reveria)<br /> |
