| <a name="verkalskomdihr_flintlock_schematics">Flintlock Schematics</a><br />*Our spiritual ancestors were the creators of small firearms and as their heirs we should continue in their footsteps. With the schematics our archivists found, we are now able to create prototypes of gunpowder weaponry. We should prepare the necessary industry to fabricate these proto-firearms and we should invest into research facilities to further study the blueprints and use them to get an advantage in military technology over our neighbours.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is copper</li><li>trade goods  is iron</li><li>trade goods   is mithril</li></ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_firearms_1 until otherwise removed</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_mil_innovations for 25 years</li><li>set country flag [verkalskomdihr_flintlock](../flags/verkalskomdihr_flintlock.md)</li> | [Restore the Archives](#verkalskomdihr_restore_the_archives)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_rifled_barrels">Research Rifled Barrels</a><br />*By adding helical grooves into the barrel of our rifles we can further improve their accuracy, since spinning the bullet stabilises the flight of the projectile. Unfortunately this also increases the complexity of manufacturing such weapons, leaving us no choice but to further expand our industrial capacities.* | <li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is copper</li><li>trade goods  is iron</li><li>trade goods   is mithril</li></ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has building weapons</li><li>value is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>remove country modifier = verkalskomdihr_firearms_1</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_firearms_2 until otherwise removed</li><li>set country flag [verkalskomdihr_rifled_barrels_researched](../flags/verkalskomdihr_rifled_barrels_researched.md)</li> | [Flintlock Schematics](#verkalskomdihr_flintlock_schematics)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_mass_produce_muskets">Mass Produce Muskets</a><br />*The recent battles have shown us that having superior guns means everything in our current age. The forges need to be expanded such that we can equip every soldier in our armies with the newest models of modern firearm technology. This will certainly give us a considerable advantage over any foe. How can they harm us if their soldiers fall to our opening volleys ?* | <li>mil power is at least 300</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is copper</li><li>trade goods  is iron</li><li>trade goods   is mithril</li></ul><li>base production is at least 15</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has building weapons</li><li>value is at least 12</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -300</li><li>remove country modifier = verkalskomdihr_firearms_2</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_firearms_3 until otherwise removed</li> | [Research Rifled Barrels](#verkalskomdihr_rifled_barrels)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_circular_standard">The Circular Standard</a><br />*While our capital is now well protected by magic and defensive buildings our other holds lack these benefits. We should standardize these defences and implement them on every hold under our flag. Our magicians are confident they would be able to achieve this, however the replicas would not be able to match the original. Our enemies shall think twice before attempting to conquer our mighty fortresses.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_hold</li><li>has terrain  dwarven_hold_surface</li></ul><li>has dwarven hold 3 yes</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>ruler has mage personality is yes</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tooltip_has_abjuration_2</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has ruler flag [abjuration_2](../flags/abjuration_2.md)</li><li>has ruler flag  abjuration_3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = verkalskomdihr_unlock_warding_gate_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [verkalskomdihr_warding_gate_unlocked](../flags/verkalskomdihr_warding_gate_unlocked.md)</li> | [Carpenters Guild](#verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalskomdihr_repair_the_warding_gate">Repair the Warding Gate</a><br />*Our people tell us of whispers in the dark, luring them into the Deepwoods. It is of utmost importance to offer at least some protection to our people. The ancient gate consists of a circular stone frame, imbued with enchanted gems, channeling the flow of magic. It creates an invisible barrier between us and the Deepwoods and offers us protection from fey influence. While we still lack the necessary magic spells and a reliable source of gem we should nonetheless immediately start with the reconstruction of the gate.* | <li>4100:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>4100:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalskomdihr_the_warding_gate_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4093:</li><ul><li>If does not have owned by is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_restore_the_archives">Restore the Archives</a><br />*We found the remnants of the old archives deep underground protected from the tooth of time. It should be our top priority to get a grip of the long lost knowledge. We are especially interested in tomes about gunsmithing, the Deepwoods and the ancient warding gate. In a quickly conducted survey we already found some promising books. Who knows what further know-how is buried in these dusty halls our ancestors left behind ?* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>If has dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>change innovativeness = 5</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_archive_knowledge for 10 years</li></ul><li>the event [The Ranger's Captain Logbook](../events/the_ranger_s_captain_logbook.md) happens</li> | [Repair the Warding Gate](#verkalskomdihr_repair_the_warding_gate)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_recast_the_warding_spell">Recast the Warding Spell</a><br />*Using our newly acquired access to valuable gems from Arg-Ordstrun and the knowledge found in the archives, we are now able to recast the enchantments of the warding gate. Our people look in awe at the now completed gate, a perfect circle glowing in light green colours, stretching from the bottom of the main hall to the top, humming with power. Once a while small green lightnings crackle over the surface, filling the hall with a faint smell of ozone. Our superstitious brethren may now sleep at ease.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gems</li><li>base production is at least 15</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>value is at least 1</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>ruler has mage personality is yes</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tooltip_has_abjuration_2</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has ruler flag [abjuration_2](../flags/abjuration_2.md)</li><li>has ruler flag  abjuration_3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul></ul> | <li>4100:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = verkalskomdihr_the_warding_gate_1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalskomdihr_the_warding_gate_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Restore the Archives](#verkalskomdihr_restore_the_archives)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_kekigs_legacy">Kekig's Legacy</a><br />*In our restoration of the archives we found the blueprints of Kekig's maze. It's a marvel of architecture, a complicated way of organizing the paths in and out of Verkal Skomdihr, filled with traps and other menaces. Let us rebuild it so that all those who oppose us shall fall into despair by even thinking about conquering our hold !* | <li>fortification expert is at least 3</li><li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add mil power = -200</li><li>4100:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = verkalskomdihr_the_warding_gate_2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalskomdihr_the_warding_gate_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Recast the Warding Spell](#verkalskomdihr_recast_the_warding_spell)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_arrow_lumber_camps">Arrow Grove Lumber Camps</a><br />*Beneath our mighty hold lies the arrow grove. As the name implies the lumber is of great quality for fabricating arrows. In the heart of the grove lies the elven city of Ayethstir.\n\nWe should conquer the woods and set up lumber camps in its vicinity to reach the first objective, getting a steady wood income, in our endeavour to revive the legacy of our ancestors as masters of carpentry. The buildings of Ayethstir are made of the very same timber we are trying to exploit, so tearing them down will provide a much needed influx of high grade lumber to kickstart our industry.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is verkalskomdihr_expedition_has_ended</li><li>has country flag [verkalskomdihr_expedition_end](../flags/verkalskomdihr_expedition_end.md)</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>province group is deepwoods_cluster_7</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tropical_wood</li><li>province id is at least 3033</li></ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>3033:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = tropical_wood</li><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>3033:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>3033:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>If has mission completed is verkalskomdihr establish outpost:</li><ul><li>clr country flag [verkalskomdihr_expedition_end](../flags/verkalskomdihr_expedition_end.md)</li></ul> | [Launch the Expedition](#verkalskomdihr_launch_the_expedition)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_the_circular_saw">The Circular Saw</a><br />*With the usage of waterpower and belts we finally have the necessary rotational force to implement a new design for our log cutting. Before the design was implemented logs were sawed by hand using a pit saw or using an up-and-down saw with a reciprocating motion. The rotary nature of the circular saw requires more power to operate but cuts faster because the teeth are in constant motion. Because of the distinctive sound while cutting logs the people have called them buzz-saws.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tropical_wood</li><li>has building mills</li><li>value is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_circular_saw for 25 years</li> | [Arrow Grove Lumber Camps](#verkalskomdihr_arrow_lumber_camps)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild">Carpenters Guild</a><br />*Different measurements, adulteration of quality timber and the lack of central regulation have led to a moderate crisis in our rapidly growing carpentry sector. Cheap substandard products and fakes are harming the reputation of our carpenters. This is a danger to our efforts of mastering the craft.\n\nOur masters of carpentry are asking us for funding to create a carpenters guild, regulating their profession. They want to protect the titles, only allowing well tested and trained journeymen to call themselves carpentry masters. As the investors behind this new guild we would gain considerable control over them, allowing us to steer the direction of their advancements and enforce quality controls.* | <li>4100:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 6 yes</li></ul><li>I13 ideas is at least 4</li><li>treasury is at least 2000</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -2000</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>4100:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalskomdihr_carpenter_guild</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = artist</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>culture = flint_dwarf</li><li>religion = ancestor_worship</li></ul><li>set country flag [verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild_founded](../flags/verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild_founded.md)</li> | [The Circular Saw](#verkalskomdihr_the_circular_saw)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_magic_mining_tools">Magic Infused Mining Tools</a><br />*Our magicians discovered that the spell cast on our warding gate could also be used for other purposes. By crimping gems on metal and using deepwood lumber for the handle, we can create tools infused with warding magic, which greatly enhance their durability. Our construction workers seem to profit the most from this new technique.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>trade goods is gems</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>trade goods is tropical_wood</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>value is at least 7</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_magic_mining_tools until otherwise removed</li><li>set country flag [verkalskomdihr_magic_tools](../flags/verkalskomdihr_magic_tools.md)</li> | [Carpenters Guild](#verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_finest_furniture">The Finest Furniture</a><br />*Recently the Emperor of Anbennar ordered a set of tables for their courtroom. The tables are made of a special white wood, which lets the viewer believe they're made out of marble. The edges are inlaid with a mix of gold and platinum, while the legs are sculpted to form statues of different gods appointed to the regent court, with magical gems as their eyes. They look as if they are able to judge you.\n\nThe tables have become a symbol of masterful craftsmanship and show that our carpenters are able to create furniture for the most prestigious places. The work of our carpenters can create different kinds of atmospheres perfectly fitting any location. Let us also order furniture to decorate the halls of Verkal Skomdihr, to further enhance the feeling of magnificence and splendor.* | <li>artist is at least 3</li><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is verkalskomdihr_veneering_happened_tooltip</li><li>has global flag [veneering_happened](../flags/veneering_happened.md)</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>increase ruler adm effect = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_the_finest_furniture until otherwise removed</li> | [Magic Infused Mining Tools](#verkalskomdihr_magic_mining_tools)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_power_the_sawmills">Power the Sawmills</a><br />*One of our engineers had a great idea of using the natural bottleneck of the Jorkhad Lake to build a dam which could power our mills. It would be a massive undertaking, probably spanning over decades and costing a fortune, but in the end it might be one of our biggest assets. Let us conquer these harpy infested lands and start the project.* | <li>jorkad lake area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>676:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier dam_stage_1</li><li>has province modifier  dam_stage_2</li><li>has province modifier   dam_stage_3</li><li>has province modifier    dam_stage_4</li><li>has province modifier     the_harpylen_dam</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_powered_sawmills for 25 years</li> | [Clear the Pathways](#verkalskomdihr_clear_the_pathways)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_water_jet_cutting">Water Jet Cutting</a><br />*Damn, there is a lot of water pressure in the dam, so much, it could cut a dwarf in half... wait I just had an idea!"\n\nFollowing his stroke of genius Grimum Dirtfist started to modify the mill he was working in, without asking for permission, laying out a pipe connection directly to the highly pressured pipes coming from the dam. Then he smithed a special valve to focus the water on a singular point. Confident in his new invention he let the water flow through the pipes. Mere seconds later the pipes exploded, flooding the nearby area. Shortly after the incident, which he survived, he got arrested, confessing his stupid idea.\n\nWhile his crude improvisation failed, with the right implementation it might even work, so maybe we should let our engineers tinker about a working machine.* | <li>676:</li><ul><li>has province modifier the_harpylen_dam</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier verkalskomdihr_water_jet_cutting_machinery until otherwise removed</li> | [Power the Sawmills](#verkalskomdihr_power_the_sawmills)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalskomdihr_settle_the_woods">Settle the Woods</a><br />*Some of our population was born on the surface and has trouble adapting and living beneath the ground. They want to settle the woods because it's shady, but not as claustrophobic as our tunnels. Some of our elite look at them with disgust saying that they are abandoning our way of living. Nevertheless we should encourage this, as the more dwarves live in our newly acquired territory the better justifiable are our conquests.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>superregion is deepwoods_superregion</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>religion is ancestor_worship</li><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>value is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = verkalskomdihr_settle_the_woods_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has superregion is deepwoods superregion, and  has religion is ancestor worship, and  has culture group is dwarven:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalskomdihr_settling_the_woods</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Establish an Outpost](#verkalskomdihr_establish_outpost)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_flower_lumber_camps">Flower Grove Lumber Camps</a><br />*We found a paradise. Everything is lush, everything is blooming. While some other parts of the Deepwoods seem to be inherently dark, here it seems as if the plants emit a faint light making everything feel brighter. Our explorers even found special trees which have lumber looking like marble, making them ideal for decoration. The people stand in line to be allowed to migrate to this heaven in the mortal planes.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>province group is deepwoods_cluster_5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tropical_wood</li><li>province id is at least 3030</li></ul><li>base production is at least 7</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>3030:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = tropical_wood</li><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>3030:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>3030:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Control the Eastern Groves](#verkalskomdihr_control_eastern_groves)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_thorn_lumber_camps">Thorn Grove Lumber Camps</a><br />*Thorns everywhere, pricking you, hindering you, driving you into madness. But the precise observer may notice flowers hidden beneath the sea of razors. They grow on a rare kind of rose, which makes big stems out of beautiful scarlet lumber. The colour is so magnificent that no costs should be avoided to gain a hold on this fascinating lumber. We do not fear the inconvenience if we can profit from it.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>province group is deepwoods_cluster_3</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tropical_wood</li><li>province id is at least 3017</li></ul><li>base production is at least 7</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>3017:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = tropical_wood</li><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>3017:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>3017:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The Flintwoods](#verkalskomdihr_the_flintwoods)<br /> |
| <a name="verkalskomdihr_clear_the_pathways">Clear the Pathways</a><br />*After setting up an administrative center in the Flintwoods, it's time to build roads allowing administrators and peacekeeping forces from Grôn-Hargûn to easily reach every part of the region. We have to cut down the trees, clear out the undergrowth, flatten the terrain of the gladeways, build bridges and move large amounts of sturdy building materials from the mountain into the woods.\n\nThe head engineer expects the travel time to be cut in half and a great improvement in security while travelling. As a nice side effect we also could use the roads to further develop the Gladeways.* | <li>treasury is at least 2500</li><li>adm power is at least 250</li><li>deepwoods superregion:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain gladeway</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -2500</li><li>add adm power = -250</li><li>custom tooltip = verkalskomdihr_clear_the_pathways_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If deepwoods superregion has terrain is gladeway:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalskomdihr_cleared_pathway</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If jorkad lake area does not have owned by is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Surface Capital](#verkalskomdihr_surface_capital)<br /> |

| <a name="verkalskomdihr_woodworking_mastery">Woodworking Mastery</a><br />*The carpenter's guildmaster requested a meeting with our council. He presented us an initiative to improve our current production process of timber, which contains all the experience they gained from years of improving their craft. They only lack the necessary funding and our approval to start the implementation. He expects to be able to considerably improve our output while not straining the forest further. We should grant it.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild_founded_tooltip</li><li>had country flag [verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild_founded](../flags/verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild_founded.md) for 9125 days</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>clr country flag [verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild_founded](../flags/verkalskomdihr_carpenters_guild_founded.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = verkalskomdihr_woodworking_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has trade goods is tropical wood:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = verkalskomdihr_woodworking</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Power the Sawmills](#verkalskomdihr_power_the_sawmills)<br />[Reforestation Decree](#verkalskomdihr_anti_deforestation_decree)<br /> |

Unfortunately, because travelling is still hard and dangerous, we have issues exercising our power in these areas. It currently takes us almost half a year of travelling to get from Verkal Skomdihr to the outer reaches of the Flintwoods. This has led to the local population creating their own local courts and policing forces over which we lack jurisdiction.\n\nLet us build a surface capital to be able to better exert our power over the region. Our architects think that the former elven city of Taráile is a perfect fit for our needs. The city lies in the middle of the forest and has a more favourable terrain for buildings than many other places.
