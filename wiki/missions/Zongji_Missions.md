| <a name="Y25_still_the_winds">Still The Winds</a><br />*The Shuimu League, led by Feiten, is a somewhat newer phenomenon in yanshen when compared to our long reign here. However, This upstart confederation of city states has been growing ever aggresive and expansionist. In the Kingdom of Xiyun, they have recently incited a rebellion. With the backing of the league, the rebels were victorious and have broken away, underneath the authority of the City of Luoyip. The league likely plans on taking the entire kingdom for themselves if they are not put in their place.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>area is iongsim_area</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y20</li></ul><li>Y20:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = 80</li><li>If has exists is Y21:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y21</li><li>amount = 16</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y23:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y23</li><li>amount = 16</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y19:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y19</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y27:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y27</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y04:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y04</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y06:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y06</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y07:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y07</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y08:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y08</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Y10:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = Y10</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul> | [An Excercise in Ambition](#Y25_an_exercise_in_ambition)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_middle_castes_mission_1">Budding Middle Castes</a><br />*Owning a port opens up many enticing opportunities for trade and advancing the restoration of our great empire.This was not always the case, however. In the past, there have not been many cities along the coast of Yanshen. Coastal trade was not very profitable or enticing for merchants, leading to small and sparse settlement. For the most part, trade within Yanshen was almost completely either up or down the Yanhe, making the cities that lay along it very wealthy, with Tianlou becoming the largest and wealthiest, as one of the only cities on the coast. However, in the aftermath of Jaher's Campaigns, many refugees fled to the coast and cities began sprouting up. These cities began facilitating trade, and later banded together and formed the Shuimu League, which we recently dealt with. With their power diminished, a vaccum has opened up in coastal trade, and we should take advantage of this.* | <li>num of light ship is at least 10</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add estate loyalty modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_middlecastes</li><li>desc = Y25_coastal_trade</li><li>loyalty = 10</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul> | [Still The Winds](#Y25_still_the_winds)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_invest_in_the_temples">Invest in the Temples</a><br />*The importance in the upkeep and maintenance of the great High Temples cannot be overstated, but the roads leading to them, and the villages that have cropped up near the temples are just as deserving of care. they should all be outfitted with appropriate amenities for visitng adherents, as well as debate halls and centers of discussion for travelling scholars.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>has province modifier temple_complex</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>years of income is at least 1</li> | <li>custom tooltip = invest_in_temples_tt</li><li>If random province has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT, and  has province modifier is temple complex, and does not have province modifier is Y25 temple amenities:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_temple_amenities</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random province has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT, and  has province modifier is temple complex, and does not have province modifier is Y25 temple amenities:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_temple_amenities</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random province has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT, and  has province modifier is temple complex, and does not have province modifier is Y25 temple amenities:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_temple_amenities</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="Y25_order_of_the_meticulous_eye">The Meticulous Eye</a><br />*The High Temples are great sources of inspiration and knowledge for all students of the High Philosophy. Endless amounts of wisdom and guidance and philosophical principles have been imparted on us by scholars of the temples; however, to this day, noone is quite sure what purpose the high temples served. What was their purpose? How did they function in order to serve that purpose? The high gods were wise enough to achieve enlightenment, so surely these structures served some grand purpose. That is what we seek to discover. To that end, we will found a new order of scholars, the brightest minds in yanshen, dedicated to researching the temples.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 6</li><li>has province modifier temple_complex</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>years of income is at least 1</li> | <li>custom tooltip = invest_in_temples_tt_2</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If asia has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT, and  has province modifier is Y25 temple amenities:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = Y25_temple_amenities</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_temple_amenities_upgrade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random province has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT, and  has province modifier is temple complex, and does not have province modifier is Y25 temple amenities upgrade:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_temple_amenities_upgrade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random province has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT, and  has province modifier is temple complex, and does not have province modifier is Y25 temple amenities upgrade:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_temple_amenities_upgrade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random province has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT, and  has province modifier is temple complex, and does not have province modifier is Y25 temple amenities upgrade:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_temple_amenities_upgrade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Invest in the Temples](#Y25_invest_in_the_temples)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_the_heavenly_towers">The Heavenly Towers</a><br />*Tianlou; the most important city in the histories of both high philosophy itself, and our dynasty. It was here Harimar conquered to, it was here that he ruled, and it is here that the greatest complex of high temples in all of haless lies. It is here in the heavenly towers that harimar vanished. With the order of scholars founded, their first task is the studious investigation of the high temples. for over a millenia, the many students of the high philosphy have venerated the high temples, with the goal of attaining enlightenment. But very few have studied what it was exactly that the temples did. What is their function? what was their function back in the days when the high gods were still bound to this lower existence? our great philosphers and scholars will be thinking hard, and studying carefuly, and respectfuly.* | <li>4871:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>philosopher is at least 3</li> | <li>add adm power = 80</li><li>add dip power = 80</li><li>add mil power = 80</li> | [The Meticulous Eye](#Y25_order_of_the_meticulous_eye)<br /> |

| <a name="Y25_an_exercise_in_diplomacy">An Excercise in Diplomacy</a><br />*One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is the ability to negotiate and navigate complicated situations with ease. A silver tongue with the ability to ease tension and come to reasonable agreements that are fair to all parties. Our current heir demonstrated these qualities in their examinations and is a very promising candidate for Liangzhu. In order to even better prepare them for the exceedingly important task of ruling, we should let them gain experience firsthand; We shall utilize their skills by sending them on diplomatic missions to nearby nations, a true testament to their skill, and hopefuly a sign of great things to come.* | <li>heir dip is at least 4</li><li>dip power is at least 80</li> | <li>add dip power = -80</li><li>country gets the modifier Y25_liangzhu_diplo for 30 years</li><li>If every known country has religion is high philosophy, and has reform is eunuch republic, and has reform is eunuch dynasty reform:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>modifier = Y25_liangzhu_diplo_relations</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="Y25_stern_diplomacy">Stern Diplomacy</a><br />*Strength of will, assertiveness, steadfastness; these are qualities sometimes underlooked in diplomats, but if one is to be truly just and fair, one must not back down in negotiations. We know our worth, and we know what is just and what is fair. Our diplomats will not only embody the common qualities of persuasiveness, compassion, and kindness, but must also be stern and unwavering in their integrity.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>desc is Y25_stern_diplomacy_tt</li><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has reform eunuch_republic</li><li>has reform  eunuch_dynasty_reform</li></ul></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Y19</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 40</li><li>dip power is at least 40</li><li>mil power is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>If does not have alliance with is Y19:</li><ul><li>add adm power = -40</li><li>add dip power = -40</li><li>add mil power = -40</li></ul><li>every ally:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = PREV</li><li>amount = 12</li></ul></ul></ul><li>add prestige = 15</li> | [An Excercise in Diplomacy](#Y25_an_exercise_in_diplomacy)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_tea_time">Tea Time</a><br />*Tea is constantly in demand as a fixture of Righteous Path religious rituals, and additionally is popular as a recreational drink. It isn't possible to have too much of it available to sell. Expanding the plantations of tea leaves will let us export more tea, which will mean both more profits and a chance at better relations with our buyers.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is tea</li><li>development is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier Y25_teatime for 20 years</li> | [Stern Diplomacy](#Y25_stern_diplomacy)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_honeyed_words">Honeyed Words</a><br />*We have begun to prove ourselves to the people of yanshen; we have been strong, willful, and stern. We have made it clear that we are not to be messed with. It was neccesary to use shows of force and might to get this far, but that is not how we wish to be viewed; we are not conquerers, we are not bullies, and we are not tyrants. Now that yanshen knows to respect us, we need not forcefuly subjugate them; by being steadfast allies, great friends, trustworthy confidants, and benevolent rulers, the people of Yanshen will willingly swear fealty to us. We must still remain strong, and assertive, and willful, but these are traits that others will look up to us for, and not resent us for. Soon enough, the eunuchs will be bowing before us in the great capital of Tianlou once more.* | <li>num of diplomatic relations is at least 5</li><li>adm power is at least 40</li><li>dip power is at least 40</li> | <li>add adm power = -40</li><li>add dip power = -40</li><li>country gets the modifier Y25_honeyed_words for 25 years</li> | [Tea Time](#Y25_tea_time)<br />[Recognition](#Y25_recognition)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_palace_of_the_divine_call">Palace of the Divine Call</a><br />*By any regard it seems that Harimar wanted the center of his empire (or at least one of them) to be in Tianlou, for it is said that he took one look at the city and fell in love with it. The city already has some pre-existing infrastructure, most particularly the decrepit Palace of the Divine Call. Renovating it will be expensive, but it will create a place of residence for our family, in addition to a new center where the highest levels of government can be overseen.* | <li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>4871:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>4871:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y25_divine_call_palace</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Masters of Tianlou](#Y25_masters_of_tianlou)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_order_of_the_divine_call">Order of the Divine Call</a><br />*The diplomatic corps has been working hard, but as it currently stands there is not enough infrastructure to separate the best of the career from the worst. To that end, there needs to be a new organ of state for the absolute best diplomats, the individuals with the initiative and skill to shift the balance all across Yanshen. The Order of the Divine Call - a cadre for only the greatest.* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier Y25_divine_call_order until otherwise removed</li> | [Palace of the Divine Call](#Y25_palace_of_the_divine_call)<br /> |

| <a name="Y25_an_exercise_in_ambition">An Excercise in Ambition</a><br />*One of the most important traits in a Liangzhu is ambition. One must always seek to become stronger, faster, smarter, better in some way. The Lianzghu must seek the betterment of not only himself but of the realm, and the people beneath it. The Liangzhu must have a clear, resolute vision for the future, a vision guided by the strict moral codes infused in them, that they will stop at nearly nothing to achieve. The future of Yanshen itself is ripe for the taking, and the Liangzhu will use their skills to make sure that it is THEIR vision that becomes reality.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.8</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>monarch is a general or an admiral</li><li>heir is a general or an admiral</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 80</li> | <li>add mil power = -80</li><li>4869:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4870:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4878:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = Y18</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>If is rival is Y19, and is threat is Y19:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = Y19</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = Y20</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = Y27</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul> |  |

We have been percieved as a joke to the population of Yanshen for nearly a milenia. this injustice has gone on for far too long. if people are to take us seriously again, we need to prove to them that we are not a force to be messed with, and not as much of a joke as we have come to be seen as. We need to show them all the power of Zongji and demand the respect that we are due.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y25_demand_respect_tt</li><li>has country flag [Y25_beaten_eunuch](../flags/y25_beaten_eunuch.md)</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 10</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier Y25_respect for 20 years</li> | [An Excercise in Ambition](#Y25_an_exercise_in_ambition)<br /> |

| <a name="Y25_the_auspicious_daughter">Auspicious Daughter</a><br />*While Tianlou is the largest and most important city in all of Haless, its daughter city of Sziagnu is going to be just as vital to our rule of Yanshen. Its position along the Yanhe means it has simple access to nearly all of Yanshen, and we eventually may want to distance some of our officials from the intrigue of Tianlou, where unsavory sorts may try influencing government affairs. We should invest in the city so it can fulfill the role of secondary capital in the future, and our first step is to invest in some important infrastructure for the city. Our architects have already begun drafting plans for a grand public square bringing glory to the house of the Divine Call. However, this public square is just the first of many projects currently planned by our architects, not just for Sziagnu, but for all of Yanshen.* | <li>4869:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>num of times improved is at least 4</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>4871:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = 18250</li><li>power = 10</li><li>key = Y25_sziagnu_square</li></ul></ul> | [Recognition](#Y25_recognition)<br /> |

It is the jewel of the yanhe, the heart, the brain of yanshen, and the most important city in all of haless. With Tianlou in our control, we have real authority. for the first time in over a milleniia. The rest of yanshen shall bow before their rightful rulers, and submit to the true emperors of Yanshen. Our benevolent Liangzhu has been gracious towards its subjects, and they bow willingly out of respect for our rule; we had once lost their respect, but now that we have proven ourselves, they willingly return to our embrace. If they do not bow willingly, then they will be forced to. They will bow, and proclaim as a message for all their brethren to hear; The Emperors of Yanshen have returned.* | <li>4871:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 5</li><li>desc is Y25_masters_of_tianlou_tt</li><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has reform eunuch_republic</li><li>has reform  eunuch_dynasty_reform</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 50</li><li>superregion is yanshen_superregion</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y25_all_eunuchs</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 1</li><li>desc is Y25_masters_of_tianlou_tt</li><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has reform eunuch_republic</li><li>has reform  eunuch_dynasty_reform</li></ul><li>is not subject</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add stability = 1</li><li>set government rank = 3</li><li>country gets the modifier Y25_emperor_of_yanshen for 25 years</li><li>custom tooltip = Y25_jiantsiang_fealty_tt</li><li>Y16:</li><ul><li>set country flag [zongji_fealty_valid](../flags/zongji_fealty_valid.md)</li></ul><li>If has exists is Y15:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = Y25_masters_of_tianlou_reward_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>Y15:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Auspicious Daughter](#Y25_the_auspicious_daughter)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_spreading_our_influence">Control the North</a><br />*In the times before Harimar, Yanshen was ruled by many squabbling rival kingdoms. The Yanhe formed the lifeblood of the kingdom of Zizhou, formed in defiance of the northern kingdom of Jiyuan. Both built fortresses all over the land to defend against the other, but neither could withstand the might of harimar, who crushed both kingdoms and erased them off the map; not even their crowns and titles remained to be claimed, destroyed by harimar and handed over to his new class of eunuch administrators. Northern Yanshen is a much more wild wartorn land in comparison to the rest of the region, even dating back to the time of Lianzhou this has been the case. The Jiangyang peoples are hardened by warfare and lives on the frontier of yanshen. Exerting our influence over these peoples brings great benefits to the state, sellswords and mercenaries willing to assist our armies for a price. As we begin to apply the caste system to the lands we conquer, many of these hardened soldiers begin vying for a position in our upper caste as warriors.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 7</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is beikyuan_area</li><li>area  is linghui_area</li><li>area   is beidugang_area</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier Y25_jiangyang_legacy for 25 years</li> | [Masters of Tianlou](#Y25_masters_of_tianlou)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_middle_castes_mission_2">Prospering Middle Caste</a><br />*The implimentation of the Yan caste system has been going smoothly for the most part. However, we have found ourselves in a situation where the lower and upper castes are much more powerful and influential than the middle castes. Despite being one of the oldest states in Yanshen, we have been an extremely minor player in the trade scene. For the longest time we have controlled land on neither the Yanhe nor the coast, and our mercantile traditions suffered for it. This means that while we hold control over quite a large portion of Yanshen, it is not our merchants driving the trade, it is the merchants of our vassals. If we were to tighten our grip on Yanshen tommorow, there is no existing infrastructure in our government to handle the administration of trade in an empire so large. We would grow completely and entirely reliant on local administration to handle the problems. while relying on local administration to solve certain problems is something that is neccesary to the management of an empire this large, we must try to avoid doing it to such a large degree. It was this folly that led to the downfall of Lianzhou in the first place. Out of concern for the health of the caste system, and the future of our empire, we must establish our own mercantile traditions and offices.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 6</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 6</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4871:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>add estate influence modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_middlecastes</li><li>desc = Y25_merchant_class</li><li>influence = 5</li><li>duration = 10950</li></ul><li>add estate loyalty modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_middlecastes</li><li>desc = Y25_merchant_class</li><li>loyalty = 10</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul> | [Control the North](#Y25_spreading_our_influence)<br /> |
| <a name="Y25_eunuch_integration_decree">Decree of Integration</a><br />*Upon conquering Yanshen, the great and wise Harimar of the Divine Call uprooted the entrenched kingdoms and nobility in the region. He devised and implimented the system of eunuch governance and administration utilized throughout Yanshen to this day. It is of great importance to his legacy that we respect his wishes and his vision, but we have hit the issue of how exactly the system of euncuh administration is going to work alongside the proposed Yan Caste System. However, this is not actually as large of an issue as it seems. Rahen's caste system is entrenched in millenia of tradition, and changes to it are nigh impossible to achieve without great upheaval. Our system has only just begun, and we have all the freedom in the world to adapt it to our needs and our vision. We are in a unique position here, in which we can create the exact system we desire, without resistance and without restraint. Thus, the question of how eunuchs can possibly fit into the caste system is solved; simply because we have designed it so, any who undergo the procedure, recieve training from an acreddited eunuch academy, and enter into the service of our administration are considered part of the upper caste, with all of the benefits that come with it. Those who enter particularly high positions will be compensated particularly well, with family members able to join them in status and recieve free training for any career in the upper caste that they wish. * | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_uppercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_eunuchs</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>government rank is at least 3</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>set estate privilege = estate_uppercastes_eunuchs_in_uppercastes</li> | [Prospering Middle Caste](#Y25_middle_castes_mission_2)<br /> |

| <a name="Y25_laying_the_groundwork">Laying the Groundwork</a><br />*When Harimar of the Divine Call disappeared, his empire eventually split. We are the descendants of the great eastern half of his empire, known as Lianzhou. We held dominion over Yanshen for many centuries, but endured a diappointing and regretable decline due to mismanagement. The other half of Harimar's empire, the Harimraj, not only maintained its authority and rule for 4 centuries longer than we did but also underwent a resurgence with the founding of the 2nd Harimraj in the year 1312, which saw it once more solidly in control of Rahen. Many of our Liangzhu have pondered why the Harimraj saw so much more success than we did, and in the year 1131, 181 years before the founding of the 2nd Harimraj, Yatasuo of the Divine Call left for Rahen and returned with his answer. Even in its shattered state, the warlords of Rahen were powerful and demanded respect. Strict adherence to the caste system allowed the rulers much greater control over their subjects than otherwise, ensuring much greater stability in the realm. And so our plan was formalized establish control over Yanshen via the implimentation of the Raheni Caste System. However, we cannot simply expect to enforce this without major pushback; for this reason, we need to take certain precautions and compromises to ensure revolts do not happen and that unrest remains low.* | <li>num of provinces in states is at least 8</li><li>has estate privilege estate_lowercastes_land_rights</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_lowercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier Y25_placated_lower_castes for 30 years</li> | [An Excercise in Compassion](#Y25_an_exercise_in_understanding)<br /> |

However, as we continue to assert ourselves upon Yanshen, we will find that these great warrior families, while they have served us immeasurably since their formation during the rise of the Caste System here, will not be enough to support our goals. As such, we need to establish more families as upper caste warriors, harimari and human alike, to bring glory to our empire. While making changes in caste such as these would be difficult and unheard of in certain parts of Rahen, our system is still in its formative years, malleable to our will.
