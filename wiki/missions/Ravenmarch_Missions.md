| <a name="ravenmarch_dostans_way">Dostan's Way</a><br />*Crossing the Dostanesck marked the beginning of our mission into Escann, and while we have made many victories against the Greentide we have strayed from this important gateway to our homeland. We must ensure that no Orcish hordes threaten Dostanor by resettling Dostan's Way, and ensure that our supply routes are re-connected.* | <li>dostans way area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>devaced area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>vernham area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>beastgrave area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>clovenwood area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>banesfork area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="ravenmarch_godshield_foothills">Godshield Foothills</a><br />*With Dostan's Way seeing traffic once again, our next priority is clear: to feed our people and defend them while they sow. The once-rich lowlands of the former Kingdom of Devaced will feed our newborn march, and the more defensible hills at the base of the Godshield Mountains will make creatures and men alike think twice before attacking the Sons of the Dostanor.* | <li>devaced area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>catelsvord area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>784:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>786:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>789:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>oudmerewood area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>verteben area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>valefort area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Dostan's Way](#ravenmarch_dostans_way)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_imperial_sympathies">Sympathy in the Empire</a><br />*As our nobles elope with their spouses and raise families between two worlds, the Anbennarians have begun to see us as a legitimace state. Our experience aiding Corin against the Greentide and our wars since then have also earned their favor, with us being a useful shield for the Empire of Anbennar. There are even some who look at us as being more reasonable cousins of the Corvurians; this we must exploit.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>is part of hre</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 50</li><li>country gets the modifier ravenmarch_imperial_connections for 25 years</li> | [Secure the Inheritance](#ravenmarch_secure_inheritance)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_midnight">Midnight</a><br />*With every passing day our prestige grows across Cannor and beyond; even the Corvurians have begun to look at us with some admiration... but mostly envy. Still, we are but bumpkins to them, outcasts that are not worthy of their attention. This will not stand. \n\nThe elite of Corvuria delight in the Masquerade, a traditional ball of the high nobility. Here the grandest of games of espionage and deceit are played in between elegant dances and gallons of wine. It is time for Ravenmarch to dispell their notion of us as poor marshmen: we will attend their most adored party, and they will see us as equals.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>prestige is at least 60</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Corvuria</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Corvuria</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>owns 441</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Corvuria</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Corvuria</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>owns 441</li><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>If every neighbor country has owns is 441:</li><ul><li>add spy network from:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = -75</li></ul></ul><li>the event [Invitation to the Masquerade](../events/invitation_to_the_masquerade.md) happens</li> | [Sympathy in the Empire](#ravenmarch_imperial_sympathies)<br />[Light in the Darkness](#ravenmarch_light_in_darkness)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_printing_truths">Printing Truths</a><br />*Ink on parchment has long been borne knowledge from previous generations, but at a painstakingly slow pace. In recent years, a curious invention has been imported and become a fascination of the bustling urban culture of Old Vernham. Capable of stamping whole pages at once, readers delight at being able to procure countless tales once thought unimaginable and entrepreneurs race to claim a stake of this new market.\n\nSo too can we profit from this: imagine the efficiency of our bureaucrats, and how we can inform our people of our triumphs. Only good can come of this!* | <li>owns core province 800</li><li>is institution enabled is printing_press</li><li>800:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul> | <li>If does not have printing press is 75:</li><ul><li>800:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = printing_press</li><li>value = 50</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have printing press is 100:</li><ul><li>800:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = printing_press</li><li>value = 25</li></ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>800:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Vernham Press](../events/the_vernham_press.md) happens</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="ravenmarch_new_vernham">New Vernham Estates</a><br />*'The hustle and bustle of Old Vernham has simply become too much for the upper crust. Our manors have become crowded by the vast multitude of lower class hovels, not to mention the incessant noises and stench of the commoners. And besides, who wants to be featured in yet another scandal in the Vernham Press?'\n\nThis sentiment is all but too common for the blue bloods of the Ravenmarch. Old Vernham has truly transformed, with the open streets of our early reconstruction transitioning to tight and crowded alleys. But this could be to our advantage: the neighbouring borough of Vernham has room for a grand new city for the aristocracy. First on the list are their new residences, full of modern amenities and gardens. But not everything has to built anew: a small perfumery operating out of a temple to Ryala has become popular recently. With some funding and expansion of their operations, the sensation of smell may be pleasant instead of noxious. An illusionary world built for those who need nothing but distraction.* | <li>owns core province 808</li><li>808:</li><ul><li>base tax is at least 8</li><li>base production is at least 6</li><li>base manpower is at least 4</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>808:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_popular_estates</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have trade goods is gold, and has trade goods is damestear:</li><ul><li>808:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = incense</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_ryalan_perfumery</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of owned provinces production income:</li><ul><li>years = 1</li><li>trigger:</li><ul><li>province id = 808</li></ul></ul></ul><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul><li>add estate influence modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>desc = RAVENMARCH_RYALAN_DISTRACTION</li><li>influence = -10</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul> | [Printing Truths](#ravenmarch_printing_truths)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_daravans_folly">Daravan's Folly</a><br />*Mundane means can only do so much to reverse Daravan's Folly, for cursed magic has permeated and forever ruined this land. No matter how much we divert the channels and drain the marshes, it will not help with the ever-present withering. But what was once ruined by magic, may be restored by it. Through our long campaign in Escann, we have found great use for the magical arts, even those not sanctioned by the Magisterium. And so too does our ancient Korbarid blood bolster our arcane abilities, that once empowered Daravan himself. We will stud the Folly with magical circles across the ley lines, and when all the mages are assembled, we will bathe the land in more magic that has ever been seen since that fateful day.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>440:</li><ul><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is daravans_folly_region</li><li>has building mage_tower</li><li>value is at least 4</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>custom tooltip = ravenmarch_folly_transmutation</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has building is mage tower, and  has region is daravans folly region:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_undoing_folly</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>fire province event [flavor_ravenmarch.20](flavor_ravenmarch.20_slug) in 7 to 15 days</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier ravenmarch_undoing_folly_mages for 50 years</li> | [Dredging the Sunken Lands](#ravenmarch_dredging_sunken_land)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_securing_brink">Seize the Brinkmarches</a><br />*The imperial border princes think they are safe to plunder our Dostanor under the protection of their emperor. They even bombard our fields with cannon-shot - those insolent Brinkmarchers! Let us revive the fear they once felt of Korbarid kingdom and humble this glorified king.* | <li>eastborders area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If does not have mil is 6:</li><ul><li>change mil = 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add mil power = 50</li><li>add prestige = 10</li></ul> | [The Revenant Jewel](#ravenmarch_new_corveld)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_pawns_on_board">Pawns on the Board</a><br />*Clutching at the coast are the petty duchies of Celliande and Toarnen, pretenders who stole their lands long ago from the Milcorissians. These Arranese proudly think themselves protectors of Anbennar's eastern reaches. Little do they realize that they pawns, not unlike the game of strategy they play, that are to be swept aside by the knights.* | <li>antir drop area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>highcliff area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>922:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = wine</li></ul><li>rotwall area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>arannen area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>gisden area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>hawkfields area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Seize the Brinkmarches](#ravenmarch_securing_brink)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_lions_pass">Lion's Pass</a><br />*Between the south of Businor and the Isle of Tef is one of the busiest sealanes in the world. With ships sailing to and fro Cannor and and Bulwar, the Busilari along the Lion's Pass have prospered. Not content with the flow of wealth, they steal from our merchants of the Flooded Coast with heavy tolls. Dostanor will guard the Busilari Straits from this thievery, by war if necessary.* | <li>busilari straits area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ravenmarch_busilari_straits_tolls for 10 years</li> | [Businori Tensions](#ravenmarch_businori_tensions)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_viakkoc">Scourge of the Seas</a><br />*Our duty takes us far from home. Evil must be defeated, wherever it is found. Jutting out in the Divenhal sea, the vile Viakkoc gnolls oppress the Ekhans and raid into the Damesneck. Blockade their coasts, raze their holds - their demonic rituals will be burned from this world! And when the flames have died down, we will rebuild Ekha as a shining beacon to the Divenhal, free from piracy and villainy! And for those travelling from Aelantir, they will find a port most open and receptive to their wares and coin.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Viakkoc</li></ul><li>ekha area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>middle akan area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>402:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>1300:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 25</li><li>key = RAVENMARCH_COLONIAL_TRADE</li></ul></ul><li>1504:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 20</li><li>key = RAVENMARCH_COLONIAL_TRADE_2</li></ul></ul><li>akan region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure Akan](#ravenmarch_secure_akan)<br /> |

| <a name="ravenmarch_secure_holdings">Secure our Holdings</a><br />*Our capital prospers at Old Vernham and Dostan's Way is ours, yet one is exposed to belligerent Orcish tribes from the north while the other suffers Gnollish raids from the Folly. Wooden palisades and moldy decrepit ruins won't do anymore: let us take example from the Corvurian castles of Shroudfort and Arca Corvur by fortifying both Old Vernham and the way home.* | <li>803:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>800:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ravenmarch_secured_holdings for 15 years</li><li>803:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_hill_and_vale</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>800:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_hill_and_vale</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Dostan's Way](#ravenmarch_dostans_way)<br />[Heart of the South](#ravenmarch_vernham)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_offer_refuge">Offer Refuge</a><br />*It is our duty to defeat the evil of the Greentide, but back at home our countrymen suffer at the whims of their abusive overlords, just as our people once did. Our contacts in Cannmarionn are ready to send us willing men and women, if we can rescue them from these tyrants. Let us give our veterans one last task: to protect them on their way, so they all can settle the Ravenmarch together.* | <li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Corvuria</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Corvuria</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>owns 441</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If every neighbor country has owns is 441:</li><ul><li>add spy network from:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = -75</li></ul></ul><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add manpower = 2</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>random owned province:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>If has exists is A59:</li><ul><li>A59:</li><ul><li>If random owned province does not have province flag is [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md):</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>set province flag [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md)</li></ul><li>If random owned province does not have province flag is [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md):</li><ul><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li><li>set province flag [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md)</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If random province has region is dostanor region, and does not have province flag is [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md):</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>set province flag [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md)</li></ul><li>If random province has region is dostanor region, and does not have province flag is [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md):</li><ul><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li><li>set province flag [ravenmarch_refuge](../flags/ravenmarch_refuge.md)</li></ul></ul> | [Secure our Holdings](#ravenmarch_secure_holdings)<br />[Godshield Foothills](#ravenmarch_godshield_foothills)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_secure_inheritance">Secure the Inheritance</a><br />*Though our foundations are secure, it is no secret that we are an inclusive people that have been even further isolated in the reaches of Escann. For Ravenmarch to thrive, we must open our courts - and our hearts, Ryala willing - to the nobility of Cannor. Let us also restore our somewhat strained relation with Corvuria, promising them that our continued war against the Greentide is worth our independence.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>region is south_castanor_region</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>region is inner_castanor_region</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Corvuria</li><li>is rival is Corvuria</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Corvuria</li></ul><li>military strength:</li><ul><li>Corvuria</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy large effect = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier ravenmarch_courtly_politic for 25 years</li> | [Dostanor Beyond](#ravenmarch_dostanor_beyond)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_light_in_darkness">Light in the Darkness</a><br />*While our new home in South Castanor has become ever more secure, reports from Corvuria have been troubling - perhaps even more than before. The terrors of the night grow bolder each day, hunting both Baldostan peasant and Gablainéy townsfolk, and the guard does nothing! The pleas of the clergy fall flat on the monarch as well, receiving but empty promises as their temple halls fill with grieving crowds. With rising anger, the townsfolk of Gablainé have risen behind the Neratic clergy behind a new movement: the Order of the Ruby Scale. Organizing nightly militias to hunt and kill the vampiric beasts, despite the Corvurian crown's orders to lay down arms, the Order stands alone against this threat. If the king will not do so, we will aid them in their darkest hour!* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Corvuria</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Corvuria</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>owns 441</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>If every neighbor country has owns is 441:</li><ul><li>add spy network from:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = -75</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = inquisitor</li><li>name = "Carmine Judge Cristof"</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>culture = corvurian</li><li>religion = regent_court</li></ul><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>loyalty = 5</li></ul><li>If does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>433:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_order_of_ruby_scale_1</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>loyalty = 5</li></ul><li>433:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Secure the Inheritance](#ravenmarch_secure_inheritance)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_new_court">A New Court</a><br />*The Regent Court is in chaos, with the absence of Castellos and the clash between Corin and Adean to succeed him becoming bloodier. Existing divisions between sects have widened to perilous canyons, leaving the temples of Ravenmarch isolated. While we have already pledged our support for Corin in the war of gods, there is still much debate and strife amongst our own clergy. As of yet, the only compromise has been between the so-called 'Triumvirate' priests of Corin, Nerat, and Ryala. They foremost agree on the ascendancy of Corin as head of the pantheon, but also on a more traditional balance of power between the godly cults, unlike the zealots of Corintar. We must support them in restoring order to the faith in our realm.* | <li>religious unity is at least 0.75</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has idea group religious_ideas</li><li>religious ideas is at least 5</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>theologian is at least 3</li><li>inquisitor is at least 3</li></ul></ul> | <li>add government reform = ravenmarch_triumvirate_court</li><li>the event [Blessings of the Triumvirate Court](../events/blessings_of_the_triumvirate_court.md) happens</li> | [Corin's Might](#ravenmarch_corins_might)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_dredging_sunken_land">Dredging the Sunken Lands</a><br />*Once the heartland of Dostanor, it is only the desolation of the Folly. At best, sunken ruins poke above the mire muck and temporary camps light the low hills. Jergan once sought to restore the ancient city of Coveld, but we return to his vision with far more than just the resources. Visionaries and experts have studied techniques of draining marshes and redirecting the flow of rivers. While it may not be as glamarous as a great show of arcane might, it may produce just what we need: an arable field to till.* | <li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>region is daravans_folly_region</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>A59:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>A59:</li><ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>region is daravans_folly_region</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>region is daravans_folly_region</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>If daravans folly region has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_dredging</li><li>duration = 14600</li></ul></ul> | [Bloody Victory](#ravenmarch_bloody_victory)<br /> |

Our ancestor's halls were buried by the tidal wave of Daravan's flood, and even the ones that were feverishly maintained have sunken into the rotten mire. We are not tomb robbers: we are reclaiming what is our inheritance. And now that the Ravenmarch holds the Folly under her protection, we have the time and resources to to claim what was lost.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 442</li><li>province id  is at least 443</li><li>province id   is at least 446</li></ul><li>base tax is at least 3</li><li>base production is at least 3</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has province id is 442, and has province id is 443, and has province id is 446; and  has manufactory trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ravenmarch_dostanorian_estate_rebuild</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier ravenmarch_dostanorian_legacy for 50 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Folly Archaeology](../events/folly_archaeology.md) happens</li></ul> | [Dredging the Sunken Lands](#ravenmarch_dredging_sunken_land)<br /> |
| <a name="ravenmarch_new_corveld">The Revenant Jewel</a><br />*We return to where our journey started: the ancient ruined city of Corveld, once heart of Dostanor. Here Jhergan once attempted to rebuild the flooded city, establishing a small stronghold atop the sunken foundations from which he battled the Flamemarked Gnolls. Alas, with no popular and financial backing, Corveld was abandoned once more. Now with the Ravenmarch reclaiming Dostanor, we can restore this Jewel of the Flooded Coast.

A tall-tale of high adventure, tragedy, and romance was told across the land of Jergan's endless struggle against the Flamemarked Gnolls. \n\nBut behind every legend is a nugget of truth: Jergan and his compatriots were extraordinary cavalrymen, despite dwelling in the cursed swamp. They spared no expense to keep their steeds healthy and strong, and wisely knew when to eschew armor for mobility. After leaving Daravan's Folly for Escann, Jergan and his fellows kept their old habits. Sometimes seen as deranged by adventurer captains, Jergan and his men routed Greentide hosts with charges across terrain once deemd impassible to cavalry. \n\nThe Sons of the Mire have pledged to hold onto these proud traditions, with many commanding vast influence in the realm.

It is not bravey that sets her apart: rather, it is her willingness to sacrifice herself to defeat evil. \n\nAll around us are shadows gathering, despite defeating the remnants of the Greentide at our hand. Once allies at Castonath, the adventurer bands have departed to distant corners. Some have become monsters themselves in retribution of the Greentide, while others dabble in dark arts.

From Bal Ourd the Castanite Kingdom of Bahar the Legion II Ourd battled man and Gnoll, but the loss of most of the region was inevitable.

| <a name="ravenmarch_hub_of_pirates">Quell the Hub of Pirates</a><br />*A spear piercing into the East Diven, Drolakand has long had an infamous reputation as a haven for pirates. A barren land fit for little commerce, the Drolakandi have learned well from the Gnolls on the art of theft, raiding the Bulwari coast and even stealing entire vessels. While their gnollish overlords have long been expelled, the piracy of our vessels cannot be ignored.

Once we were reliant on the Corvurians and the Anbennarians for basic supplies, let alone ever-needed arms and munitions. But now that we are strong and self-reliant, the ages still yet change. Firearms become more reliable, slowly making armor and heavy weaponry obsolete. Once the dread of our enemies, the warhammers of the Vernham Heavy Brigade have seen little use recently.

All beings are borne into a world in which they know no one, and as they grow they meet many friends and family. But out there in the world, there are those who might accept you into their heart. Is it proper to turn them away with scorn? Throughout Escann we have encountered Orcs and Goblins, whose hordes razed the land. But with their evil leadership slain, what is left are people not so much different than us.

| <a name="ravenmarch_combating_sun_cult">Combating the Sun Idolatry</a><br />*Despite our conquests into Bulwar, we have had little success with guiding them from the false worship of their sun god. For centuries they have believed that Surael is the only living god, and that the worship of the Regent Court falls on dead ears. While Castellos may be dead, we know for truth that our gods are real - for how much more real can they be than Corin rising from death, only to ascend to godhood upon slaying Korgus Dookanson? The Bulwari may simply be hesistant to learn of this truth. If they are to listen, it will be best from those they trust.

Built as the Sun Elven capital of the Eliznan Protectorate, it became the seat of a kingdom following the assasination of Jexis. Throughout its years of wax and wane, one thing has remained constant: the need for more docks and shipyards.
