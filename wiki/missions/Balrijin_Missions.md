| <a name="Y85_reaching_out">Reaching Out</a><br />*Foreign diplomacy was not something we pursued for a long time, until the state of Jiangdu attacked us. An internal rebellion erupted in their lands during that conflict, and that enemy of our enemy became our friend. When that war happened, we quickly found ourselves employing Jiangszun human diplomats to ease communications with foreign realms even more; these diplomats now form the Golden Tongue faction.\n\nThe people of Lanjinhui have been a great boon to our security, and getting more of such allies will surely further improve our standing, that is, if the diplomats of the Golden Tongue faction are to be believed... They have selected a few target realms who are known to treat local kobold minorities well, and now ask the state to finance diplomatic envoys to those realms.* | <li>has estate privilege estate_church_religious_diplomats</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has kobold minority trigger yes</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier Y85_empowered_golden_tongue for 25 years</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = diplomat</li><li>name = "Ekill of The Goldtongue"</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = statesman</li><li>name = "Dhank of The Goldtongue"</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="Y85_opening_migration">Opening Up Migration</a><br />*Our current policy of fostering positive relations with the realms that house our diaspora makes it easier for us to gain military allies, and the Golden Tongues insist that this policy be both continued and extended. \n\nThey have set their sights on perhaps the strongest of these states, the Wulin to the west. They wish not only to establish alliances, but also to allow for merchants, settlers and craftsmen to more easily travel to and from these realms, for the good of both our and their economy.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has kobold minority trigger yes</li></ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has reform wulin</li><li>Country is Y99</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = Y85_golden_hq_allowed_tt</li><li>set country flag [Y85_golden_hq_allowed_flag](../flags/y85_golden_hq_allowed_flag.md)</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>If every country has alliance with is ROOT, and  has any owned province has kobold minority trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul><li>If random owned province has kobold minority trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul></ul><li>If has any country has alliance with is ROOT, and any country has country modifier is harimari administration:</li><ul><li>4976:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul></ul><li>4976:</li><ul><li>add human minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Reaching Out](#Y85_reaching_out)<br /> |
| <a name="Y85_martial_arts_exchange">Martial Arts Exchange</a><br />*The Wulin, master of vast lands to the west, also houses martial arts schools which can only be rivaled by our own Smouldering Claws and Kindled Scales.\n\nPerhaps an alliance doesn't have to be the final step in our relation with this western behemoth; an exchange of martial arts students and teachers could help all our styles develop.* | <li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is army_reformer</li></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has reform wulin</li><li>Country is Y99</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y85_second_dragondance_tt</li><li>has country flag [Y85_second_dragondance_flag](../flags/y85_second_dragondance_flag.md)</li></ul> | <li>small increase of human tolerance effect = yes</li><li>create general:</li><ul><li>tradition = 60</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier Y85_influx_of_military_advisors for 10 years</li><li>country gets the modifier Y85_xia_lessons for 20 years</li> | [Opening Up Migration](#Y85_opening_migration)<br />[Reinstitute Dragon Dances](#Y85_reinstitute_dragon_dances)<br /> |
| <a name="Y85_xiadao_goldscale_temple">Xiadao Martial Arts Temple</a><br />*As the Smouldering Claw and the Kindled Scale clans continue to vie for key positions in our military through the reborn tradition of Dragon Dances, their champions and sages hone their skills not only on the hilltops of Balriza, but also in the schools of Xiadaoâ€¦\n\nBut whilst they come to learn, some stay to teach, so much so that the kobold district in the city now boasts its own martial arts schools, where Claws, Scales, independents and members from minor martial kobold clans all teach their arts. The next step would be to unify these schools into one large complex, on which our state can exert its influence more easily.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>owns 4559</li></ul><li>owns 4559</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y85_second_dragondance3_tt</li><li>has country flag [Y85_third_dragondance_flag](../flags/y85_third_dragondance_flag.md)</li></ul> | <li>If has Y28 has owns core province is 4559:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = Y28</li><li>Y28:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>4559:</li><ul><li>add kobold minority size effect = yes</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier Y85_kobold_lessons for 20 years</li><li>If every country has owns is 4559:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Y85_kobold_lessons for 20 years</li></ul> | [Martial Arts Exchange](#Y85_martial_arts_exchange)<br /> |
| <a name="Y85_forming_the_orders">Forming The Orders</a><br />*After yet another clash between Claws and Scales in the capital, accompanied with over a dozen hospitalisations, the Sage Council has decided to enact a policy of geographical distancing.\n\nThe two clans are to start moving their training facilities to the countryside, to ensure youth brimming with vigour but lacking in discipline stop breaking each other's kneecaps over who has the best fighting style. To this end we must ensure ample space is available for them to settle.* | <li>owns core province 4844</li><li>owns core province  4974</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y85_second_dragondance4_tt</li><li>has country flag [Y85_fourth_dragondance_flag](../flags/y85_fourth_dragondance_flag.md)</li></ul> | <li>set country flag [Y85_smouldering_kindled_hqs_allowed_flag](../flags/y85_smouldering_kindled_hqs_allowed_flag.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = Y85_smouldering_kindled_hqs_allowed_tt</li><li>add mil power = 100</li> | [Xiadao Martial Arts Temple](#Y85_xiadao_goldscale_temple)<br /> |
| <a name="Y85_integrate_human_auxillaries">Human Auxillaries</a><br />*As our military has become more active over the last few decades, reforms have been implemented to modernise our military. One branch which we have only recently started to really take seriously, is the idea of cavalry. Combat on horseback, or even on terrorbirds for that matter, has always been difficult for us kobolds due to us being... vertically challenged.\n\nAs such, it is only logical that we supplement our kobold infantry with partially human cavalry. To facilitate this, trustworthy human subjects will be needed.* | <li>mil tech is at least 6</li><li>high tolerance human race trigger is yes</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>accepted culture is river_yan</li><li>accepted culture  is hill_yan</li><li>accepted culture   is western_yan</li><li>accepted culture    is coastal_yan</li><li>accepted culture     is forest_yan</li><li>accepted culture      is northern_yan</li><li>accepted culture       is southern_yan</li><li>accepted culture        is eastern_yan</li><li>accepted culture         is daxug</li><li>accepted culture          is kuldaakin</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y85_second_dragondance5_tt</li><li>has country flag [Y85_fifth_dragondance_flag](../flags/y85_fifth_dragondance_flag.md)</li></ul><li>owns core province 4856</li> | <li>country gets the modifier Y85_human_cavalry_auxilaries until otherwise removed</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_golden_lancers</li></ul> | [Forming The Orders](#Y85_forming_the_orders)<br /> |
| <a name="Y85_a_new_status_quo">A New Status Quo</a><br />*With the rivalry between the Claws and Scales deescalated, our realm can finally finish its military reforms!\n\nA new system is to be implemented, where the sages or their champions will no longer fight for military office, but rather divide the decision-making along offensive and defensive lines. The new system may not be perfect, but it is ours.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y85_military_hqs_built_tt</li><li>4844:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier Y85_smouldering_hq_modifier</li><li>has province modifier  Y85_smouldering_hq_modifier2</li><li>has province modifier   Y85_smouldering_hq_modifier3</li></ul></ul><li>4974:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier Y85_kindled_hq_modifier</li><li>has province modifier  Y85_kindled_hq_modifier2</li><li>has province modifier   Y85_kindled_hq_modifier3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y85_military_balance_struck_tt</li><li>has country flag [Y85_military_balance_struck_flag](../flags/y85_military_balance_struck_flag.md)</li></ul><li>4856:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul><li>4844:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul><li>4974:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier Y85_reformed_clan_military_system for 30 years</li><li>country gets the modifier Y85_two_clan_system until otherwise removed</li> | [Human Auxillaries](#Y85_integrate_human_auxillaries)<br /> |

| <a name="Y85_awaken_smouldering_clan">Smouldering Claw Clan</a><br />*The Smouldering Claw Clan, once a clan of great renown, are best known for their aggressive martial arts styles, which bleed over into their military decision-making. They earned respect for singleclawedly resisting the subjugation of our people during the times of Harimar and Jaher, but faded into relative obscurity during the calm last few centuries.\n\nIt wasn't until the first war against Jiangdu that they once again accumulated some renown for defeating a Jiangdu regiment in Longdao whilst outnumbered two to one. If we are to lead offensive campaigns of our own with success, we will surely need their expertise once again.\n\nIt is time to awaken the Smouldering Claw clan, for we are going on the attack once again.* | <li>is at war with religious enemy</li><li>war score is at least 25</li> | <li>custom tooltip = Y85_smouldering_clan_awakened_tt</li><li>set country flag [Y85_smouldering_clan_awakened](../flags/y85_smouldering_clan_awakened.md)</li><li>the event [Smouldering Claw & Kindled Scale](../events/smouldering_claw_kindled_scale.md) happens</li> | [Demand Access To Hills](#Y85_demand_access_to_hills)<br /> |
| <a name="Y85_reinstitute_dragon_dances">Reinstitute Dragon Dances</a><br />*The current way our military functions, as several separate factions - the most prominent being the Claws and Scales, being paid for by taxes but refusing to operate under the command of a unified structure - is hampering our military potential. In order to convince prominent military figures to cooperate or to legitimise any commands coming from someone of another faction, we need a reform. \n\nThe Golden Sage has not come up with a new idea however, but rather a very old one- The Dragon Dances. In ancient times clan leaders, sages or even brothers would solve disputes or establish hierarchy through the only way no one could challenge- martial arts. \n\nThe Dragon Dances will function as a way to ensure all kobold snouts are pointing the same direction, and the strongest fighters can obtain and hold onto vital military positions.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is army_reformer</li></ul> | <li>the event [The First Dragon Dance](../events/the_first_dragon_dance.md) happens</li> | [Smouldering Claw Clan](#Y85_awaken_smouldering_clan)<br /> |

| <a name="Y85_phokhao_expedition">The Phokhao Expedition</a><br />*After the disappointment following the thorough search of even the most northern mountaintop of the Ogre Hills, the well of ideas has run dry. To the west lie the inhospitable lands of the hobgoblins, and to the north a mountain range so unscalable only a very stubborn species of goats appears to call it home. \n\nThe way forward was unclear, until the idea to send small parties, be they hired adventurers or government employees to nearby climbable mountains and hills. Most of these were manageable, but the Phokhao mountain range calls for a military style sweep.* | <li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>4808:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4824:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4982:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4835:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4836:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4752:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4754:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4756:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4775:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4776:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4942:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4777:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>4783:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Phokhao Expedition](../events/the_phokhao_expedition.md) happens</li> | [Northern Ogre Hills](#Y85_northern_oni_hills)<br /> |
