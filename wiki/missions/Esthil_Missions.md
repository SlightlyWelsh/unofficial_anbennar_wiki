| <a name="B54_defeating_time">Defeating Time</a><br />*It is said that the wheel need not be reinvented, and indeed, with Canrec's texts we see his own experiences with lichdom, as well as his collected memoirs of other notable liches such as the Lich King Xamarzu, and even Morgurax the First. It is quite humbling, really, that even with all the power and vast evil needed to achieve lichdom that our predecessors all kept journals of their initial days and lamentations. What's important however, are the regimens and rituals they used to make the most of their first few years as masters of undeath.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is esthil_tt_1</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [lich_ruler_has_phylactery](../flags/lich_ruler_has_phylactery.md)</li><li>has ruler flag [is_a_lich](../flags/is_a_lich.md)</li><li>has ruler flag  is_a_secret_lich</li></ul><li>has country flag [canrecs_research](../flags/canrecs_research.md)</li></ul> | <li>change adm = 1</li><li>change dip = 1</li><li>change mil = 1</li><li>take estate land share gigantic:</li><ul><li>estate = all</li></ul> | [Gather Canrec's Texts](#B54_gather_canrecs_texts)<br /> |

| <a name="B54_the_skull_keep">The Skull Keep</a><br />*The Skull Keep not only acts as a central bastion of power in the east of our realm, but doubles as a prison (and some say lab) for those enemies of the state; orc-apologist, anti-imperialist, and of course, anti-undead activists.* | <li>865:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>has building ramparts</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>865:</li><ul><li>rename capital = "Skull Keep"</li><li>change province name = "Skull Keep"</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = esthil_skull_keep</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Southern Walls](#B54_the_southern_walls)<br /> |
| <a name="B54_the_dread_legion">The Dread Legion</a><br />*The internal policing of our realms is of paramount import; while the Black Gate to the south provides for our defense from without, the Dread Legion out of Skullkeep maintains peace and order within. Led by intelligent undead, they are responsible for the maintenence of prosperity in our realm.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>province group is southern_walls</li><li>province has current tech fort trigger is yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_esthil_dread_legion</li></ul><li>If random owned province has province group is southern walls, and  has province has current tech fort trigger is yes, and  has manpower building trigger is yes, and does not have province modifier is esthil fortifications:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "esthil_fortifications"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has province group is southern walls, and  has province has current tech fort trigger is yes, and  has manpower building trigger is yes, and does not have province modifier is esthil fortifications:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "esthil_fortifications"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has province group is southern walls, and  has province has current tech fort trigger is yes, and  has manpower building trigger is yes, and does not have province modifier is esthil fortifications:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "esthil_fortifications"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has province group is southern walls, and  has province has current tech fort trigger is yes, and  has manpower building trigger is yes, and does not have province modifier is esthil fortifications:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "esthil_fortifications"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Skull Keep](#B54_the_skull_keep)<br /> |
| <a name="B54_the_wightknights">Knights of the Black Eye</a><br />*The Order of the Sapphire Eye was largely responsible for the fall of Escann to the Greentide. For years they pushed this misbegotten idea of chivalry, and relegated the once heirs of Castanor into sorting their mettle with duels rather than war! They still put up a valiant fight when the orcs came, but now they can finally redeem themselves in undeath.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of cavalry is at least 25</li> | <li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_esthil_wightknights</li></ul> | [The Dread Legion](#B54_the_dread_legion)<br />[The Pale Host](#B54_the_pale_legion)<br /> |
