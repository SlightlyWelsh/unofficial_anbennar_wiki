| <a name="tuathak_copper_mines">Copper Monopoly</a><br />*Eordand is a land replete with riches, but for all it has it lacks the most important of all: ample supplies of iron, copper, and other important metals. While there is a lack of domestic iron, the sources of copper in Eordand are firmly held by our Tuathak brethren: it has made our legions strong and our pockets heavy. The lords of Sglard have even named themselves Copperheart, doubtless after their hold on the copper supply. However, the current production is not quite enough to meet our needs: let us secure control of one of the mines, and invest into our future.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>1118:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 6</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>1813:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 6</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>1118:</li><ul><li>If has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "tuathak_copper_rush"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul><li>1813:</li><ul><li>If has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "tuathak_copper_rush"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tuathak_prepare_praisegranting_festival">Contact with Cannor</a><br />*We have known that there are lands beyond our shores, mostly sparsely inhabited by primitive beings not blessed by our Fey Lords. The Caamasi also tell us of merchants from far to the south. What has arrived this day is not an ordinary occurrence: a massive wooden ship bedecked in gleaming iron guns sailed into our harbor, making inquiries about our lands and our peoples. Doubtless impressed by our might, they wish to stay in our lands for some time. This occasion warrants a reaction: let us prepare for a Praisegranting!* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>area for scope province:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>colonial parent:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 60</li> | <li>add treasury = -60</li><li>add dip power = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier "tuathak_festival_preparations" for 25 years</li> |  |

Our visitors from across the sea have taken interest in this festival: let us invite them to it!

| <a name="tuathak_iadth_transgressors">Iadth Transgressors</a><br />*A glowering mar on our reputation, and an attack on all of the Autumn Court, the former realm of Dorcurt was seized by a Peitar invasion from the Domandrod. This vile imposter, calling itself Iadth, tore apart the former Autumn Court in the name of 'balance' of the seasons. For too long they have squatted on our autumnal lands: vengeance must be delivered, we must drive the Iadth imposters back to the Domandrod!* | <li>2050:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2017:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2016:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2014:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2003:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Iadth</li></ul> | <li>If every known country has primary culture is tuathak:</li><ul><li>add war exhaustion = -2</li><li>add mil power = 25</li></ul><li>add war exhaustion = -2</li><li>add mil power = 50</li><li>If raithlos area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If sglolad area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ruigfar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If iadth area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Rally the Phalanx](#tuathak_rally_the_guard)<br /> |
| <a name="tuathak_unite_the_northmarch">Unite the Northmarch</a><br />*The ancestral homeland of the Tuathak, the Northmarch guards the rest of Eordand from the despicable Snecboth idolatrists. Now that the Iadth defilers have been dealt with, our home has been made secure from all but our wavering kinsfolk. Our peoples still disunited, our lands still vulnerable to the sneaky Peitar, the haughty Selphereg, and the savage Snecboth.

| <a name="tuathak_march_into_spring">March into Spring</a><br />*Autumn has secured its sovereignty against the coming cold, but another force lurks that threatens our peace: the Selphereg of the Spring Court. The ancient borders of our people, Tasmet of the first change in autumn leaves, was stolen from the Tuathak by the opportunistic Arakepruni vernals. We must ensure not only that our lands are restored to our rule, but that the unnatural magics of the Spring cannot threaten us anymore: Arakeprun and its Spring Court must be shown its rightful place under our watch!* | <li>2013:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>darhan area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If trasand area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If monkast area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If pelodard area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If drisleak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add mil power = 25</li><li>add prestige = 10</li> | [Unite the Northmarch](#tuathak_unite_the_northmarch)<br /> |
| <a name="tuathak_pretenders_of_pelomar">Pretenders of Pelomar</a><br />*To the south are the pathetic impostures, the so-called Champions of the Fey. For too long Pelomar has exploited its long defunct title, it is time that they are put down and replaced by those truly worthy.* | <li>owns core province 2049</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Pelomar</li></ul> | <li>If sidmargbal area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Demands of the Domandrod](../events/demands_of_the_domandrod.md) happens</li> | [March into Spring](#tuathak_march_into_spring)<br /> |

| <a name="tuathak_rally_the_guard">Rally the Phalanx</a><br />*These are times of crises uncounted: our Autumn Court in Dorcurt razed by the Peitar, the endless advance of the Snecboth and the hated winter on our lands, and more threaten the preservation of our Autumn. The legions must be assembled if we are to withstand the change of seasons in these dark times and return to the sanctity of Autumn.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "thriving_arms_industry" for 25 years</li><li>2014:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="tuathak_golden_acres">Golden Acres</a><br />*Blessed by Autumn, our lands are by far the most beautiful of all Eordand. Shimmering glades of yellow, orange, and red, our forests are likened to that of lavish sculptures wrought of Gold, Copper and Rubies. This beauty is marred by the scorches of warfare and the defilement of invaders; by necessity we must protect our forests and lands. If we can prove that we are worthy of Autumn's grace, our cause will inspire warriors domestic and foreign to join our cause to defend our Golden Acres. What is more beautiful than the sight of our wonderful Autumn trees secure with the faint ringing of practiced swordplay?* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>area for scope province:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>prestige is at least 30</li> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If area has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "tuathak_glade_of_warriors"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul></ul><li>add army tradition = 10</li> | [Rally the Phalanx](#tuathak_rally_the_guard)<br /> |

| <a name="tuathak_aftermath_of_the_randrunnse_conquest">Aftermath of the Randrunnse Conquest</a><br />*Beyond our ancestral lands is a most cursed and frozen land inhabited by those who ignorantly worship the forces of their own destruction. Far worse than that, the Snecboth dare to bring and intensify the winter against us, invading our lands hoping to seize them for themselves! It is good that those days have ended, for our warriors were proven superior: the lands of Eighard, Jhorgashirr, Slegcal were thawed of their wintry grasp by the warmth of Autumn. We must remain vigilant: the threat of their wintry idolatry remain deadly. Our strongholds in our claimed lands must be secured against any icy incursion.* | <li>randrunnse region:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 14</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If random province is city, and  has port, and  has region is randrunnse region, and  has development is 13, and  has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add adm power = 25</li><li>add dip power = 25</li><li>add mil power = 25</li> |  |
