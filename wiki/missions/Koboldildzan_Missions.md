| <a name="KOB_better_than_fish">Better than Fish</a><br />*Along the Dragon Coast's southern beaches, small kobold fishing villages have long survived at a subsistence level. But the sea's fish really lack the flavour of the bone-white specimens found in cavern lakes. It is time to dream bigger.\n\nWith the recent flourishing of our nation, it seems the next generation of kobolds in these fishing villages are more disposed to tinkering with (metallicized) rod and (enchanted) string than fishing with them. We should see if we cannot nurture this further.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tt_better_than_fish</li><li>dragondowns area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is fish</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul></ul></ul><li>dragonpoint area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is fish</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_artificers</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has area is dragondowns area, and has area is dragonpoint area; and  has trade goods is fish:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = glass</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>If random owned province has area is dragondowns area, and has area is dragonpoint area; and  has trade goods is fish:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Determine our Fate](#KOB_determine_our_fate)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_clever_prospecting">Clever Prospecting</a><br />*Even though many of our tribes have lived on the surface for generations, none would deny the faint longing for mountain and cave that lays at the heart of every kobold, rooted in our draconic nature.\n\nThus if we are to live above-ground, we best make the most of this legacy. There are indications the gnomes once mined a variety of precious metals in the Dragon Coast; we will certainly be able to out-do them in time.* | <li>179:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul><li>production efficiency is at least 0.25</li> | <li>179:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gold</li></ul> | [Better than Fish](#KOB_better_than_fish)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_more_than_wool">Shun the Sheep</a><br />*Sheep. Bah!\n\nTheir tangled hair is prone to catching on scales, and they are constantly skittish around us, acutely aware that we hold the blood of dragons — who devour them by the dozen — in our veins. We should see if we cannot replace some of these ugly mammals with elegant machines of wood and metal, producing something that will out-do their itchy offerings.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tt_more_than_wool</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 3</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is dragondowns_area</li><li>area  is dragonpoint_area</li><li>area   is gnomish_pass_area</li></ul><li>trade goods is wool</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>development is at least 12</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If random owned province has area is dragondowns area, and has area is dragonpoint area, and has area is gnomish pass area; and  has trade goods is wool, and  has manufactory trigger is yes, and  has development is 12:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = cloth</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>If random owned province has area is dragondowns area, and has area is dragonpoint area, and has area is gnomish pass area; and  has trade goods is wool, and  has manufactory trigger is yes, and  has development is 12:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = cloth</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>If random owned province has area is dragondowns area, and has area is dragonpoint area, and has area is gnomish pass area; and  has trade goods is wool, and  has manufactory trigger is yes, and  has development is 12:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = cloth</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Clever Prospecting](#KOB_clever_prospecting)<br /> |

| <a name="KOB_house_the_trapsmiths">House the Trapsmiths</a><br />*The Guild of Trapsmiths has existed for decades, constructing elaborate devices designed to repel any foe foolish enough to enter our caverns. However, they have yet to obtain a formal home. It would be in our best interests to establish a formal guildhall for them in the capital.* | <li>189:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kobold_construction for 25 years</li> | [Protect our Hoard](#KOB_protect_our_horde)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_fortify_the_pass">The Electric Pass</a><br />*The Gnomish Pass is the great gap in our defences, the chink in our extensive natural armour, the hole in our scales. With the enemies of koboldkind no natural defenses can truly protect our land from the uncouth hordes of tallmen. We must fortify our lands with kobold-designed defenses, and let it be the most feared defensive contraption in the lands - for from now on when tallfolk think of kobold artificery they will think of... the Electric Pass.* | <li>gnomish pass area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 4</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has fort level is 2, and  has area is gnomish pass area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = kobold_fortification</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [House the Trapsmiths](#KOB_house_the_trapsmiths)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_explore_magical_techonology">Kobold Artificery</a><br />*The gnomes were a threat because of their ingenuity, whether in intrigue and guile or more recently, their technological prowess. With the gnomes came artificery: the art of taming the wild magics of the world into machine. We kobolds have long dreamed of being closer with our draconic forefathers. It is said that dragons come from magic... and artificery is turning magic into machines. What if we create a new school of artificery, where we can become one with the machine, and be one with magic, and with dragonkind?* | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>has building university</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kobold_research for 25 years</li><li>mission reward artifice points 3 = yes</li> | [The Electric Pass](#KOB_fortify_the_pass)<br /> |
| <a name="KOB_technological_breakthrought">Technological Breakthrough</a><br />*Kobold Artificery is one part madness and one part blind hope. We dare to explore and experiment beyond the strict rules of gnomish artificery or the careless abandon of goblin boomcraft. Our artificery is about machine and flesh, and thus have improved our people, and our society with that.* | <li>innovativeness is at least 10</li> | <li>country gets the modifier kobold_breakthrough for 25 years</li><li>mission reward artifice points 5 = yes</li> | [Kobold Artificery](#KOB_explore_magical_techonology)<br /> |

| <a name="KOB_dig_deeper">The Undercity</a><br />*Soxun Kobildzex was once the hive of koboldkind, lurking deep in the tunnels in overcrowded caves, nooks and crannies... but no more. We have blasted the foundations of the tunnels to create a vast cavern that is more than the eye can see, and in that cavern, where cramped tunnels once lay... are buildings. Sure, tightly packed, but capable of housing more kobolds and then some... but among the houses are grand academies of infrastructure, markets and everything else that makes a true city... except the fact that its deep underground... yes. An undercity!* | <li>189:</li><ul><li>is capital of is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = kobold_greatest_cavern</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change province name = "Kobildzan Undercity"</li></ul><li>decrease monstrous 5 = yes</li> | [Cavern Planning](#KOB_construct_more_housing)<br /> |

We must show them that we are a civilized people just like them, and that trade with us can be just as lucrative as anywhere else, if not more so.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kobold_trading_partner for 50 years</li><li>decrease monstrous 10 = yes</li> | [Sell our Metals](#KOB_sell_our_metals)<br /> |
