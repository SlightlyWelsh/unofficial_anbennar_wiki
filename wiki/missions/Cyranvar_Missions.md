| <a name="I45_cluster_1">Silent Lake Grove</a><br />*The Silent Lake of Clan Elyn has long been known as one of the most tranquil groves, at least along the shores. Elynáyle, the traditional capital has long been a place for elves to live out nostalgic memories of days in the remnant fleet. Its inhabitants have long spent their days sailing across the placid waters and fishing the bountiful waters to their hearts' content. Despite what one would expect of the Fey Forest, the open waters of the lake itself hold no significant threats to life or limb.\n\nThe southern shore is noted for a swampier character, with looming mangrove-like leviathans towering from the waters, creating a tangle of roots far more perilous than the open waters. The southernmost part of the grove, near Sáwelahain has long been a goblin stronghold, though the lake's shore has remained elven since the initial conquests.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 1:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 1:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_2">Mountain Grove</a><br />*The Mountain Grove of Clan Myna has long been appreciated as the one place where the land pierces the heavens, breaks free from the oppressive darkness of the forest's canopies. Their proud mountain home is carved from the caves in which the frightened elves, trapped within the forest first sheltered. Its caverns and slopes hold numerous hand-hewn dwellings that have been continuously inhabited for nearly the whole of the elves' tenure in the wood.\n\nThe Myna have long stood as a beacon of the Wood Elves' culture, above the rest in both valor and elevation. The woods of the grove are largely unremarkable, more peaceful than most thanks to their proximity to the forest's edge. Though it should be minded, "peaceful" may be quite a different measure in the Deepwoods.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 2:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 2:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_3">Thorn Grove</a><br />*The Thorngrove of Drennen lies at the center of the Deepwoods. It stands as perhaps the most overtly menacing part of the forest. While brambles and spines are nothing unusual in any part of the wood, even the trees take on a warped and thorny appearance this deep in the groves. While quite thoroughly cleansed of goblins and other rivals to the elves, the region was perhaps one of the most tightly held by the Fey. The spirits' sway has long been quite firm with pathways, and even whole villages seeming to phase in and out of the material plane on a whim.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 3:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 3:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_4">Bone Grove</a><br />*The Bone Grove has long been the home of Clan Cenág, one of the least numerous but tightest knit of the elves' clans. Though every wood elf quickly learns to navigate the tangle of roots and ferns that make up the Deepwood's paths, in the Bone Grove, they are forced to also learn to keep their balance when discarded femurs and tibias are added to that mix, and to mind the dens of bones and skulls at the center of many a clearing. Despite the danger of the bone-hoarders that inhabit these strange dwellings, this grove also has long held one of the greatest concentrations of goblins remaining in the forest.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 4:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 4:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_5">Flower Grove</a><br />*A name like the "Flower Grove" would surely put the mind at ease… Wouldn't it be one of the loveliest of the wood? With those softly glowing bulbs lending it light, with the vibrant colors of the ever-blooming flowers. The Scotha would call it lovely indeed. But who doesn't adore their home? Few others would, as the flowers were important enough to earn the grove's name only thanks to the great danger they pose.\n\nEvery inhabitant of the grove need make themselves a botanist, perhaps even an alchemist for the ease with which one could find danger in its beautiful flora. From friendly-looking fruits that can rot the gut, to pollens that set all manner of strange hazes over the mind, even a poorly judged step can find thorns filled with Cannor's most potent toxins ripping through the sole of a traveler's boot.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 5:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 5:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_6">Hunter's Grove</a><br />*The Hunter's Grove is home to the mightiest, most twisted beasts of the Deepwoods. Those who dare to try and tame it soon grow into warriors that rival even the forest's orcish invaders in their might. Providing they survive, of course. Home to Clan Fealgarn, the grove provides perhaps the most sporting hunts in all of Cannor. The giant malformed pets of the Fey crash through the woods, splintering the ancient trees as they stalk their prey with venomous claws, with rows of teeth so numerous that one could hardly take count before they're taken into them. * | <li>deepwoods cluster 6:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 6:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_7">Arrow Grove</a><br />*The Arrow Grove of the Ayeth's exact etymology is disputed. Is it for the fine wood employed in the crafting of arrows? Or is it the fact that arrows have long been the only reliable weapon, when a single misstep upon the treacherous ground could send one plunging to their demise? The limestone caverns beneath this part of the wood have eroded the forest floor into a maze of caverns, tunnels and gullies too treacherous for navigation.\n\nIt's far safer to traverse the canopy, bounding through the branches, swinging along vines, than to risk the treacherous maze below, where one misstep could send you down as long a fall as one from the canopy to firm ground. Even most of the Fey are reticent to trespass the treacherous earth of the grove, for the horrors that lurk beneath it promise some of the most torturous fates that the natural world offers outside the Effelai Jungle.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 7:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 7:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_8">River Grove</a><br />*Perhaps the most sincerely tranquil and pleasant of the groves, at least in days past, the River grove Ahain was, until the coming of the Greentide, a rare bastion of natural harmony in the Deepwoods. Elves, goblins, and some of the Woods' most prominent populations of satyr lived peacefully side by side. It is even rumored that a few remaining ancestors of the centaurs had been sighted living peacefully there, from time to time.\n\nThe region long held some of the least ireful of the Fey, resulting in the land's disposition to groves of bountiful fruits, and rivers teeming with an abundance of fish, around which most settlements were clustered. As the forest recovers from the orcish assault, one can only pray that this peace and abundance might return.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 8:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 8:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |
| <a name="I45_cluster_9">Shadow Grove</a><br />*Ghul, the Shadow Grove. Home to the clan of that name, this remote corner of the forest had long been the black sheep of the Deepwoods. Shaded by the embrace of the Serpentspine's towering peaks on two sides, and an impenetrably thick canopy of black leaves above, the region was pitch black, with even the Jorkad river's headwaters wholly shaded in their flow, not a ray of light to be seen along its desperately rushing waters.\n\nThe grim elves of Ghul are rumored not only to appease the Unseelie, in their perversions and dark whimsy, but even to take travelers in appeasement of the viciously misanthropic Ashentree Fey, their dark practices a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.* | <li>deepwoods cluster 9:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>years of income is at least 0.4</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -0.4</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li></ul><li>deepwoods cluster 9:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add mercantilism = 4</li> |  |

| <a name="I45_securize_the_border">Secure the Border</a><br />*Following the emergence of the Greentide, many of the gladeways leading into the Deepwoods were abandoned. We must remedy this by establishing control over the outward paths.

| <a name="I45_only_the_best">Only the Best</a><br />*Our decision to pursue a policy of enforced isolation is predicated on maintaining a highly elite standing army. While everyone is expected to undergo military training so that they might be called up in times of dire need, only the best among us are fit to serve in the standing army. This ensures that we have a serious military edge over our rivals, but this also means that filling our ranks to replace our fallen soldiers is difficult.* | <li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is discipline</li><li>value is at least 0.2</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier cyranvar_only_the_best until otherwise removed</li> | [Promote Education](#I45_promote_education)<br />[Remember the Fallen](#I45_remember_the_fallen)<br /> |
| <a name="I45_a_safe_country">A Safe Country</a><br />*As part of our ongoing policy of isolation, leading figures in our military establishment have called for the adoption of a strategy of preemptive engagement. They argue that striking beyond our borders to quell rising threats is superior to a policy of reactive defensiveness. The veracity of their argument has struck a chord with the High King. We must crush whatever threats emerge before they can harm our homeland!* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy large effect = yes</li><li>custom tooltip = cyranvar_a_safe_country_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [a_safe_country](../flags/a_safe_country.md)</li></ul> | [Only the Best](#I45_only_the_best)<br /> |
| <a name="I45_the_model_elf">The Model Elf</a><br />*In deciding to pursue isolation, our state has needed to thoroughly educated the populace about the benefits of this. Part of this education is rooted in a policy of mandatory service, known colloquially as the "Model Elf" program. Our citizens know that only by being wholly devoted to Cyranvar will the state prosper,and the security of the country be preserved. This ensures that we enjoy certain economic and military benefits that most states lack.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 6</li><li>dip is at least 6</li><li>mil is at least 6</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>adm power is at least 500</li><li>dip power is at least 500</li><li>mil power is at least 500</li></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have adm is 6, and does not have mil is 6, and does not have dip is 6:</li><ul><li>add adm power = -500</li><li>add dip power = -500</li><li>add mil power = -500</li></ul><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier cyranvar_the_model_elf until otherwise removed</li> | [A Safe Country](#I45_a_safe_country)<br />[Silvar Ishu](#I45_silvar_ishu)<br /> |

We shall demand an oath of fealty from the remaining Kings in order to unite our people for the first time in history. Any who might foolishly decline this generous offer will be brought to heel by force.* | <li>has legitimacy equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 50</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has ruler modifier lich_ruler</li></ul> | <li>If has any known country has primary culture is wood elf, and any known country has capital scope has superregion is deepwoods superregion; and does not have tag is I45; and does not have subject:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>If every known country has primary culture is wood elf, and  has capital scope has superregion is deepwoods superregion; and does not have tag is I45; and does not have subject:</li><ul><li>the event [Submit to Cyranvar](../events/submit_to_cyranvar.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="I45_a_capital_city">A Capital City</a><br />*As Cyranvar coalesces into a true state, our capital is sorely lacking compared to the other great cities of Cannor.

| <a name="I45_toward_the_future">Toward the Future</a><br />*The unification of the Deepwoods and the establishment of the Oak Monarchy affords our King the unique opportunity of deciding upon the direction of the Wood Elven people.
