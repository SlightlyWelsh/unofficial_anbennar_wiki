| <a name="shrakk_mossmouth_architecture">Raise the Roof</a><br />*These marshy lands aren't stable enough for most permanent construction techniques, as heavy stone forts will sink into the mud and low buildings will rapidly become inundated with floodwater.

| <a name="shrakk_in_the_dark">Lurkers in the Dark</a><br />*Deep within the cramped tunnels of the mountain we've found a great sprawling structure, populated by what appear to be small and lanky Ogres. They call themselves "Orcs", and their city is known as Amldihr. That was all we managed to learn before they assaulted our warriors and explorers for "trespassing".

| <a name="shrakk_para_bellum">If You Want Peace</a><br />*Peace clearly cannot be negotiated between us and Amldihr, they've even taken to leaving their tunnels to attempt to track us in our own swamp, a futile effort for sure but it shows their desire for war and carnage.

| <a name="shrakk_vrilbesh">Rise of Vrilbesh</a><br />*Just a scant few decades ago we were warring clans crammed into a small corner of the swamp, oblivious to the world around us, along with its dangers. Now, as we burgeon into a powerful realm, capable of conquering the ancient capital of the dwarves and possessed of a mighty and prosperous capital, we are no longer a clan, but a rising kingdom within these tepid swamps. Now is the time for the Kingdom of the Great Swamp to be declared, Vrilbesh.* | <li>has institution feudalism</li><li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>stability is at least 3</li><li>adm tech is at least 7</li> | <li>If has exists is J48:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>change tag = J48</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>restore country name = yes</li></ul><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>set government rank = 2</li><li>change government = monarchy</li><li>add government reform = ogre_kingdom</li></ul> | [King of the Hill](#shrakk_koth)<br />[Khortveta System](#shrakk_caste)<br />[Shrakk'ktar](#shrakk_shrakkfort)<br /> |

| <a name="shrakk_pathfinders">Recruit Pathfinders</a><br />*Goblins have excellent eyesight, and their small size allows them to squeeze through gaps we couldn't possibly dream of.

| <a name="shrakk_caste">Khortveta System</a><br />*Our time with the goblins has resulted in a recognizable social hierarchy being created, with us clearly at the top and various levels of importance based on social class and wealth. This caste system has become known as the Khortveta, or the Order, of our realm, and is a step towards creating a properly organized kingdom.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier gnoblar_migration</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add next institution embracement = 25</li></ul> | [Out of My Swamp](#shrakk_out_my_swamp)<br /> |

| <a name="shrakk_orcs">The Small Ogres</a><br />*Through our conquest of Amldihr and the settling of our swamp, we've ended up with a large amount of orcs within our borders. Though they may be far weaker than us, they are in far greater numbers, and would be an excellent addition to our forces, replacing the fragile and scrawny goblins as our auxiliaries.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has orcish minority trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add accepted culture = black_orc</li><li>country gets the modifier small_ogres for 20 years</li><li>country gets the modifier integrating_orcs for 20 years</li><li>medium increase of orcish tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Rise of Vrilbesh](#shrakk_vrilbesh)<br /> |
| <a name="shrakk_ogrillons">Ogreblooded</a><br />*The result of some of our more "adventurous" warriors and auxiliaries, a caste of ogre-blooded orcs has become prevalent within our borders. We call them §YOgrillons§!, and they've inherited the strength of an ogre and the honorable spirit of an orc. Though their inherent sterility means they are few in number, by integrating them into our warbands we shall gain a new and loyal force to lead our armies.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier integrating_orcs</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ogrillons until otherwise removed</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_ogrillons</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul><li>medium increase of orcish tolerance effect = yes</li> | [The Small Ogres](#shrakk_orcs)<br /> |

| <a name="shrakk_greywall">Raise the Greywall</a><br />*To the west of the Northern Pass lies expansionist Orcs, brutish Trolls, and reaving Gerudians. Many of our settlements have been raided and destroyed by these forces, and to prevent them from ever striking deeper into our demesne our architects have presented plans for a great chain of walls, trenches, and barracks to deter further incursions from Cannor.* | <li>owns core province 4176</li><li>4176:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>years of income is at least 2</li> | <li>add years of income = -2</li><li>4176:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ogre_greywall</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Lonely Mountains](#shrakk_loneguard)<br />[Flood the Pass](#shrakk_flood_pass)<br /> |

| <a name="shrakk_cold_reception">A Cold Welcome</a><br />*We have encountered a new power in the west, through the forests of the Northern Pass.
