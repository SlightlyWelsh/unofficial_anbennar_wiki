| <a name="rogieria_crown_farranean">The Crown of Farraneán</a><br />*Farraneán was a realm that existed where Rogieria now stands. The waves of  Greentide did not drown every Escanni in its wake, especially here along the borders with the Empire of Anbennar and the Elfrealm of Ibevar.\n\nIn the mountains of Valefort, the surviving members of the Síl na Eán family, the former rulers of Farraneán, hid to survive. If Rogier could take one as a wife, it would make the Silmuna the rightful monarchs of this land and give the returning Farrani good reasons to accept our rule.* | <li>owns core province 780</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>If has ruler flag is [rogieria_young_owl_alive](../flags/rogieria_young_owl_alive.md):</li><ul><li>the event [The Crown of Farraneán](../events/the_crown_of_farranean.md) happens</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>define consort:</li><ul><li>dynasty = "síl na Eán"</li><li>culture = farrani</li><li>female = yes</li></ul><li>add queen personality = righteous_personality</li><li>whistlevale area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = root</li></ul><li>cursewood area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = root</li></ul></ul> | [The Young Owl's Ambition](#rogieria_young_owl_ambition)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_black_tree">The Black Tree</a><br />*Whistlevale was the beating heart of Farraneán, and center of its realm. While many Farrani have returned to their former realm and original homes, the cities are mostly in ruins. As per the deal with Margery, Rogier agreed to restore Farraneán to its former glory, and Whistlevale is the first step.\n\nBy restoring the cities and populating the countryside, we will attract more than just Farrani refugees to our realm, but sellswords and businessmen alike– future allies and pawns for Rogier to use in his plans.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>whistlevale area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add accepted culture = farrani</li><li>777:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rogieria_rebuilding_escin</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>whistlevale area:</li><ul><li>change culture = farrani</li><li>change religion = root</li><li>add half elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rogieria_restored_caseans</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>random list:</li><ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = rogieria_farrani_development_tooltip</li> | [The Crown of Farraneán](#rogieria_crown_farranean)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_restore_caseans">Restore the Caseáns</a><br />*The Caseáns originated as  a type of fortified location, similar to a castle or fortress, designed with the intention of combatting the victims of the White Pestilence. Later, they became key strongpoints in defense of Farraneán .Restoring these landmarks  will keep much of Rogieria's core territory safe, and grant us a strong position to launch further expansion and reclamation.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>cursewood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>valefort area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>cursewood area:</li><ul><li>change culture = farrani</li><li>change religion = root</li><li>add half elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rogieria_restored_caseans</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>random list:</li><ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>valefort area:</li><ul><li>change culture = farrani</li><li>change religion = root</li><li>add half elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rogieria_restored_caseans</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>random list:</li><ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = rogieria_farrani_development_tooltip</li> | [The Black Tree](#rogieria_black_tree)<br /> |

| <a name="rogieria_cogauluis_ball">The Cogaulúis Ball</a><br />*After decades of hard work, the lands of Farraneán enjoy a prosperity that surpasses even the times of Castanor. Cities rebuilt bigger than before, the roads safe for travel, and record harvest in our farmlands.\n\nIn order to celebrate the restoration of Farraneán, Margery proposed to celebrate a Cogaulúis Ball, an Esmari custom of the first Farrani brought with them to their new homes: A river party where the waters of the Cogaulúis become filled with light, laughter and music. As goes the saying, Margery's wishes are Rogier's commands.* | <li>whistlevale area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>valefort area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>cursewood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Cogaulúis Ball](../events/the_cogauluis_ball.md) happens</li> | [Gateway to the Empire](#rogieria_gateway_empire)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_vincen_body">Exhume Vincen</a><br />*With the darkness of the night as their veil, our Imperial allies and agents will sneak into an Istralorian cemetery in the search of Vincen's grave, hidden after the end of the fourth Lilac war. It seems strange that Vincen, former Grand Duke of Dameria and Emperor of Anbennar would rest eternally here. Yet, perhaps hiding his corpse in plain sight was the best decision. In a grave marked for 'Aldowle síl Dameria' lies the great Old Owl. Now let our agents retrieve his body and be off into the night, to return him to his family.* | <li>277:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier rogieria_recovered_vincen for 10 years</li> | [Fate of the Silmuna](#rogieria_fate_silmuna)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_crown_dameria">The Crown of Dameria</a><br />*Many treasures were lost with the fall of the Silmuna and the sack of Anbenncóst. One of them was the crown of the Kingdom of Dameria, made by elven artisans for Marion Silmuna, the founder of the Silmuna dynasty.\n\nOne of our supporters gave us information that although the crown was stolen by Rose Party soldiers, it never left Anbenncóst. We need to send spies to the city to verify this information, and if possible, recover a piece of our legacy.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Crown of Dameria](../events/the_crown_of_dameria.md) happens</li> | [Exhume Vincen](#rogieria_vincen_body)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_emulant_vincen">Emulant of Vincen</a><br />*Among the heroes of house Silmuna, Vincen is perhaps the one who understood most deeply what Anbennar – unity – truly stands for. A master diplomat, his sincere words brought more allies to his side than Lorentish treachery could ever hope to take away.\n\nThere wasn't a court in Cannor unhappy to greet Vincen as a guest. Even the Lorentish nobles wished to gain his favor, as he wed Eilís Siloriel to end the First Lilac War. After the death of Queen Reanna III Siloriel, Vincen vowed to enforce the rightful succession according to Lorentish law, first by pushing his wife Eilís' claim, then his son Adénn's.\n\nHad it not been for the treachery of the roses, he would have succeeded, finally defeated Dameria's greatest rival, and brought all of Anbennar and Lencenor to heights of prosperity hitherto unknown. We will set our sights just as high, and not fail.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier rogieria_wit_of_vincen for 25 years</li> | [Damerian Paragons](#rogieria_damerian_paragons)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_right_hand">The Right Hand</a><br />*The Wexonards unlawfully annexed the provinces of Varivar and Eargate after the Invasion of Damesear. Ever since, the loyal subjects of the Silmuna have been living under tyrants.\n\nIf we are going to reclaim our rightful place on the throne, it is imperative that we secure this vital defensive position against the mainland. It should be straightforward enough to contact the old Damerian loyalists, and a network among them will make claiming our rightful lands easier.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 190</li></ul><li>is in shadowmoon trigger is yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 190</li></ul><li>is in shadowmoon trigger is yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>5:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Leverage Old Loyalties](#rogieria_leverage_loyalties)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_the_soul">The Soul</a><br />*On the southern side of the Damesear is the foremost temple of the cult of the Dame. The Silmuna are direct descendants of Auci, an avatar of the Dame, so in a sense her continued worship is both a source of national pride, and legitimizes the Silmuna bloodline. We should do our utmost to ensure the loyalty of those who control this sacred landmark, and if we can't, we can at least ensure that safe travel to and from the area is guaranteed.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>4:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>4:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>4:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 190</li></ul><li>is in shadowmoon trigger is yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add legitimacy = 10</li> | [The Right Hand](#rogieria_right_hand)<br /> |

It would be only right to make use of their influence and abilities. The foremost amongst them will be given a privileged position in the Small Council, as direct advisors to his majesty.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = treasurer</li><li>name = "Tristan Plumwall"</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = half_orc</li><li>religion = regent_court</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = spymaster</li><li>name = "Valeran síl Silvelar"</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = east_damerian</li><li>religion = regent_court</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = commandant</li><li>name = "Laurenne síl na Damesdemele"</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = east_damerian</li><li>religion = regent_court</li><li>female = yes</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [The Last Silmuna](#rogieria_last_silmuna)<br /> |

But what use is legacy with nobody to whom it can be passed on?\n\nThe Silmunas were all but wiped out in the Lilac Wars, save the king's uncle Rogier 'the Exiled', and his great father Lothane 'Bluetusk'. (The less said about traitorous Wesdam the better.) Rogier must produce an heir, and ensure that the rightful line of Rogieria-Silmuna continues.* | <li>has heir</li><li>legitimacy is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add prestige = 5</li><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>random list:</li><ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>increase heir adm effect = yes</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>increase heir dip effect = yes</li></ul><li>33:</li><ul><li>increase heir mil effect = yes</li></ul></ul> | [The Young Owl's Ambition](#rogieria_young_owl_ambition)<br /> |
| <a name="rogieria_rogierian_nobility">Adventurer Nobility</a><br />*The Sons of Dameria were in no small part composed of nobles who lost everything when Dameria was butchered by the traitors. As we marched against the Greentide, former lords stood no higher than commoners.\n\nNow, Rogier sees fit to grant these loyal nobles new fiefs in the northern lands of the former kingdom of Adenica, but their time as brothers-in-arms with the common man has had a particular effect on the nobles of Rogieria.\n\nThey do not view themselves as superior – how could they, when they stood and fought and died side-by-side – and in their new fiefdoms they conduct themselves not so much as rulers, but as leaders, making common cause with their people.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 70</li></ul><li>falsemire area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is root</li></ul><li>falsemire area:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>adenica area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is root</li></ul><li>adenica area:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>silvervord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is root</li></ul><li>silvervord area:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>falsemire area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rogieria_adventurers_settling_modifier</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>silvervord area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rogieria_adventurers_settling_modifier</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>adenica area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rogieria_adventurers_settling_modifier</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul> | [A Kingdom for Rogier](#rogieria_kingdom_rogier)<br /> |

However, when she and the king saw the city themselves, it was little more than collapsing ruins and burnt-out shells.\n\nIt is of great importance to her majesty that it be restored without delay. So it shall be! Call for the workmen, the settlers, the returning Farrani!

Pioneers, fortune-seekers and Marcher Lords. Loyalists and traitors, but Damerians nevertheless.\n\nIf we want to see a Silmuna ruling from Anbenncóst again, we need to remind them of our common origin to make them fight for our just cause. As per Rogier's command, we will give special attention to their lands, to remind them of the benevolent rule of the Silmunas.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is rogieria_for_the_young_owl_tooltip</li><li>escann superregion:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>culture is west_damerian</li><li>culture  is anbenncoster</li><li>culture   is nurcestiran</li><li>culture    is ancardian</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy medium effect = yes</li><li>add manpower = 10</li><li>custom tooltip = rogieria_for_the_young_owl_effect_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has superregion is escann superregion, and does not have area is valefort area; and  has or has culture is west damerian, and or has culture is anbenncoster, and or has culture is nurcestiran, and or has culture is ancardian; and  has development is 10:</li><ul><li>change culture = root</li></ul></ul> | [Reclamation Army](#rogieria_reclamation_army)<br /> |

The fate of so many of our kin has been left to the records of traitors and usurpers.\n\nIt is no wonder then that our lost are so hard to find.

Our findings in Anbenncóst have led us here, to this somber scene.\n\nSuch a tragedy is enough to bring tears to the eye of a Silmuna, but not today. Today we have come with a purpose, not to mourn, but to exhume the corpse of Adénn 'Skylance' Silmuna. Father of Rogier the Exiled, son of Vincen 'The Old Owl' Silmuna, and the last Grand Duke of Dameria. Now, let us take him far from this sorrowful sight and give him a proper burial worthy of his stature.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>3:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul><li>3:</li><ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>root</li><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier rogieria_recovered_adenn for 10 years</li> | [Fate of the Silmuna](#rogieria_fate_silmuna)<br /> |

He learnt every technique known in Cannor and before coming of age he even matched the techniques of the masters blow for blow. Yet the radiance of his success was brought to face the shadow of betrayal. When the Rose Party bore their thorns against the empire it was Adénn who drew the most ire, especially among the Lorentish who remembered the Skylance from the mockery he made of the Kyllian Tourney. Adénn kept fighting back with great valor no matter who or what was taken from him.
