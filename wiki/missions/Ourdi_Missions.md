| <a name="U16_last_refuge">A Last Refuge</a><br />*The mighty walls of Bal Ouord have been the salvation of our people many times; from the gnollish horde of the Xhazobain to the recent goblin invasion, nothing has broken these glorious Castanorian walls.\n\nNevertheless, with time everything weakens and falls to ruin, especially while under siege by a horde of goblins. Though still a mighty bastion, outside its outer walls much of Bal Ouord lies in ruin.\n\nIf we are to survive, we must repair this last, greatest defense of ours. It'll also allow us to put our archive of Castanorian construction techniques to good use.* | <li>510:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_castanorian_citadel</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>increase legitimacy large effect = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_castanorian_lessons" for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="U16_dwarven_relations">Dwarven Relations</a><br />*The dwarves of the Tûngr Mountains might be an excellent ally or a dangerous enemy, but they certainly cannot be a mere neighbor. Though some wish to ally with them, citing Castanor's long-standing dwarven friendship, others warn that they are yet another republic and urge a position of hostility. Our precise relationship must be defined at once, whether it be a friendship as strong as that between the Castanites and the Stone Dwarves or yet another war against yet another group of vile republicans in Bahar.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Ovdal Tungr</li><li>is rival is Ovdal Tungr</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Ovdal Tungr</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has alliance with is F23:</li><ul><li>U16:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = F23</li></ul><li>F23:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = U16</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_dwarven_allies" for 10 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>subtract variable:</li><ul><li>which = OurdiAnger</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If tungr mountains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_dwarven_loot" for 10 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = OurdiAnger</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [The Rotten Republic](#U16_source_of_the_trouble)<br /> |

| <a name="U16_goblin_against_goblin">Goblin Against Goblin</a><br />*Our new and unwelcome goblin neighbors are a fractious lot, divided between the Landshark and Oubbligschild Clans. It would be very difficult to fight both of them at once, and goblins aren't the wisest race, so perhaps we can instead arrange an incident and get the caverats to kill each other for us.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Landshark Clan</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Oubbligschild Clan</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Landshark Clan</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Oubbligschild Clan</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has spy network in has who is U11, and has spy network in has value is 30:</li><ul><li>U11:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = U12</li><li>type = cb_insult</li><li>months = 12</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has spy network in has who is U12, and has spy network in has value is 30:</li><ul><li>U12:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = U11</li><li>type = cb_insult</li><li>months = 12</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Sons of Castan](#U16_sons_of_castan)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_handling_the_merchants">Handling the Merchants</a><br />*The Crathánori are the people who can most relate to our suffering during the Decades of Devastation, as they too faced the fruit of elven incompetence and goblin monstrosity. Indeed, even before the Decade of Devastation, our people mixed with theirs - the province Withacen being under their rule, yet thoroughly Ourdi in character.\n\nSadly, they are ruled over by penny-pinchers chosen by the mob, such is their corruption by the democratic sentiments of their former Re'uyeli rulers. Let us invade their land, put their politicians to the sword, seize their wealth and place the Crathánori under the rule of a true Ourdi king!* | <li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy medium effect = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>If reuyel area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_protected_trade" for 20 years</li> | [Like a Phoenix](#U16_reclaim_ourdia)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_source_of_the_trouble">The Rotten Republic</a><br />*The blame for the Decades of Devastation can be readily placed on the Sun Elves who once ruled Re'uyel - while the Re'uyeli can be admired for having overthrown such incompetents, they simply committed a new sin after; the adoption of democracy, rejecting the rule of kings in favor of appointing the masses as their own sovereigns.\n\nWhile their false cult of Surael could perhaps be tolerated, this challenge to the rule of kings - and, thus, the authority of Castellos himself - is simply not something we can permit. We must destroy the heretical Re'uyeli state and bring its rebellious people under the rule of a true king, loyal to Castellos, god of kings and laws!* | <li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>If medbahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If magairous area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_settlers_stream" for 20 years</li> | [Handling the Merchants](#U16_handling_the_merchants)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_finish_the_fight">Finish the Fight</a><br />*The northwestern coast of Bahar is ours and we have avenged ourselves on monster and heathen alike. Nevertheless, the fight continues. The goblins of Mountainhugger and the followers of a false god in Baharkand are our eternal enemy, as are all of their fellows, and we cannot stop and we cannot rest until the goblins are driven back into their disgusting caves and the Bulwari are placed under our benevolent, paternal boot.* | <li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy large effect = yes</li><li>add prestige = 50</li><li>If aqatbahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If azka evran area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If fajabahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_crusading_zeal" for 10 years</li> | [The Rotten Republic](#U16_source_of_the_trouble)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_ourdi_bahar">Ourdi Bahar</a><br />*Glory to Ourdia! The goblins and Bahari have been crushed by our superior nation. Their lands are now our lands, their wealth is now our wealth, and their lives are ours to do with what we will. For the goblins, there is no option but death, but the Bahari could perhaps become valuable subjects should they embrace the true faith...* | <li>religion is corinite</li><li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>alliance with is Ovdal Tungr</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>accepted culture is bahari</li><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>region is bahar_region</li><li>culture is ourdi</li></ul></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy large effect = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li><li>If does not have government rank is 2:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 2</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_missionaries" for 20 years</li><li>If bahar szel uak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If birsartenslib area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has accepted culture is bahari:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>subtract variable:</li><ul><li>which = OurdiAnger</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If does not have accepted culture is bahari:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = OurdiAnger</li><li>value = 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has alliance with is F23:</li><ul><li>F23:</li><ul><li>the event [Ourdia Demands Conversion!](../events/ourdia_demands_conversion.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [Finish the Fight](#U16_finish_the_fight)<br />[Dwarven Relations](#U16_dwarven_relations)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_save_the_bahari">Save the Bahari</a><br />*For their own good, we must eradicate the Sun Cult and its false, heretical views among our Bahari subjects. Only by embracing the glory and strength of Corin can mankind survive in this hostile world - and, as her most loyal followers, it is our duty to unite humanity under her guidance.* | <li>religion is corinite</li><li>ourdia region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>religion is corinite</li></ul><li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>religion is corinite</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds  is Ovdal Tungr</li></ul></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy large effect = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li> | [Ourdi Bahar](#U16_ourdi_bahar)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_ourdi_survey_office">Survey Office</a><br />*Invasions have a tendency to disrupt proper records-keeping, and after the Decades of Devastation, the chaos of the period right after, and now our own invasion, it is fair to say the records of Bahar are very disrupted. Quite frankly, we don't know who lives where, who owns what, or even how many people live in our new capital.\n\nTo handle this problem, we shall create a new Ourdi Survey Office to create and archive these records for us. This will make it much easier for us to control our lands, by giving our government easily accessed records of any region we may wish to rein in.* | <li>536:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base tax is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_survey_office" for 20 years</li> | [Founding New Ouord](#U16_new_ouord)<br /> |

| <a name="U16_sons_of_castan">Sons of Castan</a><br />*It was in the hills of Ourdia that Humast, father of Castan the First, brokered an alliance between the local tribes and the escaped Castanite slaves. Eventually, we would both be driven out, into the Deepwoods, under the assault of the gnollish First Xhazobine. Together we would flee north into what became Castanor, but many returned as the Castanite Legion II Ouord.\n\nAfter we loyally defended the southern holdings of Castan's Empire, the weakness of its rulers would see the Legion II Ouord declaring independence as the Castanite Kingdom of Bahar, which eventually became our current Kingdom of Ourdia after some regrettable territorial losses. Now, with the collapse of authority in Bahar at the hands of the Exodus Goblins, our nation enters its final crucible - our only options are complete victory or utter annihilation!* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li> | <li>define general:</li><ul><li>name = "Brandon Brownblade"</li><li>shock = 3</li><li>fire = 1</li><li>manuever = 2</li><li>siege = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="U16_the_burning_order">The Burning Order</a><br />*Our campaign against the goblins required relatively little skill in espionage, but nevertheless we have found some among our court with an aptitude for it. One of them has entered into contact with Sun Elf loyalists in West Bahar, who would see the dynasty of Re'uyel restored to the throne.\n\nWhile we have little interest in restoring such incompetents, they don't need to know that. We can support this group abroad to destabilize our enemies, assisting them in launching rebellions at the exactly worst time for our neighbors. They'll lose relevance eventually, though, so we should leverage them while they still have a following.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>ourdia region:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is Landshark Clan</li><li>owned by  is Oubbligschild Clan</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If ourdia region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_burning_order" for 10 years</li> | [Goblin Against Goblin](#U16_goblin_against_goblin)<br />[Contact Remnants](#U16_contact_remnants)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_reclaim_ourdia">Like a Phoenix</a><br />*The Decades of Devastation, starting with some elves inticing their peasants to slaughter each other over succession disputes and ending with an invasion of monstrous goblins, have finally come to an end.\n\nMuch of our kingdom has fallen to the goblin invaders and our foremost priority as a nation must be the reclamation of this land - once the green rats have been killed or sent squealing back into the Deepwoods, we can deal with those who caused this entire catastrophe.* | <li>ourdia region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set variable:</li><ul><li>which = OurdiAnger</li><li>value = 8</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_revanche" for 10 years</li><li>If crathanor area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Burning Order](#U16_the_burning_order)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_new_ouord">Founding New Ouord</a><br />*Our conquest of Bahar is at an end. We must now take measures to finalize our integration of the region, removing any remnant goblins or sun cultists, before building a new capital from which to continue our holy crusade to secure the true homeland of the Castanites.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds  is Ovdal Tungr</li></ul><li>religion is corinite</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is exodus_goblin</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_integrating_bahar" for 20 years</li><li>increase legitimacy huge effect = yes</li><li>set capital = 536</li><li>536:</li><ul><li>rename capital = "New Ouord"</li><li>change province name = "New Ouord"</li></ul> | [Save the Bahari](#U16_save_the_bahari)<br />[Bahari Trade Control](#U16_bahari_trade_control)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_ourdi_arsenal">Ourdi Arsenal</a><br />*The land of Bahar is a thin stretch of territory in-between the Diven and the Serpentsreach - though it is possible to control through land power alone, this is inefficient. To truly control Bahar, we require a mighty fleet. Luckily, the harbor of New Ouord is the perfect place to construct a new Grand Arsenal from which we can standardize our ship designs and produce them as rapidly as possible.* | <li>536:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_arsenal" for 20 years</li> | [Founding New Ouord](#U16_new_ouord)<br /> |

With some supplies, and leadership by our knights, we could incite these survivors into an uprising against their goblin occupiers.\n\nWhile likely doomed to failure on its own, this uprising could be an excellent distraction for our own invasion - and should it fail, the rebels die as martyrs of Ourdia and what greater fate can there be than that?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Landshark Clan</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Landshark Clan</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Oubbligschild Clan</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Oubbligschild Clan</li></ul></ul> | <li>If ourdia region has culture is ourdi, and does not have owned by is U16:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = nationalist_rebels</li><li>size = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Sons of Castan](#U16_sons_of_castan)<br /> |

Though it's not a particularly wealthy area beyond the riches of the Gemisle, it is nevertheless rightfully ours, and reasserting our control here will prepare our bureaucracy to do so elsewhere.* | <li>current income balance is at least 2</li> | <li>add mercantilism = 2</li> | [Like a Phoenix](#U16_reclaim_ourdia)<br /> |

| <a name="U16_dominating_the_coast">Dominating the Ourdi Bay</a><br />*Our new navy offers us the opportunity to expand our trade network westwards, past the Gemisle. Should we establish enough trade connections, we can likely exploit them to bring new prosperity to the lands around Bal Ouord itself, as well as expand it's great salt mines to once again export rather than simply salting our own food to prepare for any future sieges.* | <li>trade income percentage is at least 0.15</li> | <li>510:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>change trade goods = salt</li></ul> | [Building a Navy](#U16_building_a_navy)<br /> |
| <a name="U16_bahari_trade_control">Bahari Trade Control</a><br />*The land of Bahar is far more wealthy than the Overmarch to which we were banished; a land of gold, wine, glass, and most of all lumber.\n\nIf we are to control Bulwar, we must start with its coasts, and for that we will require much lumber. For our nation's coffers and ambitions alike, we must control the trade of this land just as firmly as it's people - let no ship ply the ports of Bahar without the flag of Ourdia flying atop it's mast!* | <li>1312:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "ourdi_experienced_traders" for 10 years</li> | [Dominating the Ourdi Bay](#U16_dominating_the_coast)<br /> |

| <a name="U16_rekindled_guilds">Rekindled Guilds</a><br />*With our trade once again providing life to our economy, we can begin to revive our crippled guilds. Many of our guildmasters and journeymen died during the Decades of Devastation, and so we shall have to be less picky than usual - but perhaps some fresh blood is what Ourdia needs. Though we require a certain minimum of investment to revive our economy, more investment will see more return.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>region is ourdia_region</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Ourdia</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = ourdi_guilds_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If ourdia region has country or non sovereign subject holds is U16, and  has production building trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Revitalized Economy](#U16_revitalized_economy)<br /> |
