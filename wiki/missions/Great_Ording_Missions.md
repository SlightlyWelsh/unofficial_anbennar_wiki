| <a name="A17_those_who_fought">Those Who Fought</a><br />*We are not the only ones that are in open rebellion against the hegemon of Lencenor. There are others who fight against the tyranny of the Siloriel kings: The Wine Lords of Rubenaire, Eilísin and Wineport chief amongst them. We must befriend the enemies of our enemy in order to prepare for the liberation of Lencenor.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture is high_lorentish</li></ul></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li><li>culture is high_lorentish</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>num of allies is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = -10</li><li>If random known country is not subject, and  has culture is high lorentish, and  has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 100:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>modifier = strengthened_ordinger_ties</li></ul></ul> | [Contact Sorncóst](#A17_contact_sorncost)<br /> |

| <a name="A17_contact_sorncost">Contact Sorncóst</a><br />*The Wine Lords of Sorncóst hold many lands and grand armies, yet they are sworn vassals in Lorent’s complex and outdated feudal structure. We should contact those who dissent with the current state of affairs and assure them that they have the support of the Great Ording in their endeavours to change it. Through our combined might, we will grow closer to toppling Lorent’s hegemony in Lencenor.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Sorncost</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Sorncost</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture is sorncosti</li></ul></ul> | <li>A09:</li><ul><li>If does not have subject of is ROOT; and  is subject:</li><ul><li>add liberty desire = 20</li></ul></ul> | [Towards the Future](#A17_towards_the_future)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_stronger_alone">Stronger Alone</a><br />*As our diplomats speak with representatives of Lorent’s vassals, they assure them that they would be stronger alone. Those who bow to Lorent are doomed to be subjugated further and further into the apparatus of the Lorentish state, and only through open dissent against the Siloriels can they finally seek their own path in Lencenor.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>A01:</li><ul><li>vassal is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>Country is Sorncost</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is ording_lorentish_vassal_tt</li><li>A01:</li><ul><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Sorncost</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>A01:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>vassal is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>A01:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = great_ording_lorent_rebellious_vassals_tt</li><li>If every subject country has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 100:</li><ul><li>add liberty desire = 25</li></ul></ul> | [A Realm made Whole](#A17_a_realm_made_whole)<br />[Contact Sorncóst](#A17_contact_sorncost)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_our_stance_known">Our Stance Known</a><br />*If there is one truth about the Ordinger, it is that we are bound to our words. We do not meander around the truth, trying to obscure or tell only half of it. We have made not effort to hide our dissent. Now, the representatives of Lorent summon us to Lorentainé to discuss our attempts at breaking the status quo. And as our diplomat stands in front of the ruler of Lorent, he will say it plainly. "The Great Ording bows to no tyrant.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Lorent</li></ul><li>A01:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is insulted</li></ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is scornfully_insulted</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Lorent</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li> | [Stronger Alone](#A17_stronger_alone)<br />[Those Who Fought](#A17_those_who_fought)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_breaking_old_bonds">Breaking Old Bonds</a><br />*The time of pleasantries and intrigue is over. The Great Ording rallies its banners and we prepare to march east. We will retake the Northern Flats in their entirety and break Lorent, or die trying. This war will decide the fate of Lencenor for decades to come.

| <a name="A17_towards_the_future">Towards the Future</a><br />*We have been a steadfast vassal of Lorent since the times of Lorenan, even after his descendants began to measure one’s nobility through the number of elven great-grandparents they may have. When we honoured our vows to enter the Lilac Wars in 1412 and fought against the Derannic, we were promised the lands lost during the Second Lilac War in return. After the end of the Lilac Wars, this promise was broken by the Lorentish King and the West Ording remained in reaverborn hands, Duke Creston IV vowed that this would be the last straw.\n\n Their sins and pomp would make Lorenan himself turn in his grave as he watches all that he worked for be subsumed in hedonism and courtly politics, going so far as to court the descendants of the reavers that massacred our people hundreds of years ago. We cannot allow this to go on, it is imperative that we lay the foundations of our future rebellion through a network of trustworthy allies, both old and new.* | <li>num of allies is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier great_ording_looking_to_the_future for 5 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A17_a_great_debt_repaid">A Great Debt Repaid</a><br />*Those who rode in our final battle against the Derannic did so out of personal duty. Some were asked to fight with horse and spear against their will. Some had nothing to their name when they returned. Now that we have found glory once more, we must share the wealth and peace it provided with those who fought and the families of those who fell.\n\nWe shall ease up conscription among our people and let them enjoy the fruits of their arduous labour. Lands will be granted to our landless knights and men-at-arms and rewards in gold shall be handed out to those already landed. The ruler of Great Ording does not forget its people!* | <li>is not at war</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier great_ording_repaying_debts for 5 years</li> | [A Realm made Whole](#A17_a_realm_made_whole)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_unsung_heroes">Unsung Heroes</a><br />*During our war, many impoverished farmers were made to ride with our armies. While songs are written about the valiant deeds of great knights and lords, these poor souls have for a long time not seen such rewards. Though the Lorentish bluebloods may think it is unsuitable for a nobleman to praise the brave deeds of the poor folk, we are not them.\n\nWrite songs then, of the valiant sheepherder who rode just as valiantly as our knights for the glory of the Great Ording, bring the most brilliant of them to lead our armies! We shall not leave our bravest and brightest unrewarded due to pedantry!* | <li>prestige is at least 25</li> | <li>add prestige = -25</li><li>define general:</li><ul><li>fire = 0</li><li>shock = 4</li><li>manuever = 6</li><li>siege = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier great_ording_unsung_heroes for 50 years</li> | [A Great Debt Repaid](#A17_a_great_debt_repaid)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_protect_our_people">Protect Our People</a><br />*The duchy of the Great Ording was given as a reward for Maugun the Unicorn Knight’s bravery, but the Kings of Lorent also used the mighty and reputable Maugun to check the power of the Dukesof Deranne, who were growing bolder with each passing generation, thus maintaining balance in old Enteben.\n\nAfter Deranne’s betrayal in the Lilac Wars, we fulfilled our duty to punish them for their betrayal and ended the Reaverqueen’s descendants’ rule over old Deranne.\n\nBut our self-determination has not gone unnoticed in the east. By ensuring our control over the key fortifications of our treacherous former rival, we will guarantee that our people are protected from invasions, wherever they may come, and our future foes will struggle to pierce into our heartlands.* | <li>113:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 4</li></ul><li>75:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 4</li></ul><li>58:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>base manpower is at least 4</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>113:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_protect_the_people</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>75:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_protect_the_people</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>58:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_protect_the_people</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If darom area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Unsung Heroes](#A17_unsung_heroes)<br />[Erase the Reaver Legacy](#A17_erase_reaver_legacy)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_those_left_behind">Those Left Behind</a><br />*The people of Darom have long been overlooked by the King of Lorent. The area is far to the west of Lorentainé, they bear no truly remarkable cities and they are relatively poor in resources and people.\n\nWe will bring them out of the apathy brought by the uncaring rule of the Lorentish king through conscious investments in the region’s defences, and ensure that the plights and grievances of these peoples are finally accounted for and solved posthaste by our knights.* | <li>darom area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -50</li><li>darom area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_low_lorentish_liberation</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>If shrouded coast area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Protect Our People](#A17_protect_our_people)<br />[Breaking Old Bonds](#A17_breaking_old_bonds)<br /> |

| <a name="A17_a_blaze_of_glory">A Blaze of Glory</a><br />*It is an undeniable truth that the duchy of Great Ording is not as powerful as it once was. Centuries ago, we dominated the entirety of the Northern Flats, our grand cavalry armies were some of the most feared in all of Western Cannor. But after the invasion of the Reaverqueen in the 870s, the devastation brought by the Sorcerer-King and the loss of lands during the Second Lilac War; we find ourselves weaker than ever.\n\nPerhaps our fate is to fall in with the times and be subsumed by Lorentish influence, but the Ordinger knights still remember the names and tales of mighty heroes, Teudur II the Reaverslayer and Duke Maugun the Unicorn-Knight among others. These memories spark a fire in their hearts, a wish to be the next hero that brings glory and fame to the Great Ording, and these memories drive us towards one final charge to reclaim the lands once ours. Whatever our future is, it does not matter, we will make sure to win or die in a true blaze of glory! Arise riders of the Great Ording! Ride to victory or ruin!* | <li>manpower is at least 2</li><li>treasury is at least 20</li><li>is at war</li> | <li>add treasury = -20</li><li>add manpower = -2</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>cavalry = ROOT</li><li>cavalry = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier great_ording_riders_of_ording for 5 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A17_a_realm_made_whole">A Realm made Whole</a><br />*We have done the unthinkable. We have defeated the Derannic and reclaimed our lands. The valiant charge of our knights has brought us the greatest victory of the Ordingers since the Battle of Clearshore in 860. We have reclaimed the West Ording and righted the wrongs of the Second Lilac War. Finally, the Great Ording of Duke Maugun is whole once more, and we may renew old ambitions.* | <li>107:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If deranne area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Towards the Future](#A17_towards_the_future)<br />[A Blaze of Glory](#A17_a_blaze_of_glory)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_memories_of_clearshore">Memories of Clearshore</a><br />*In 860, the famed Reaverking Rangvald invaded the lands of Clearshore with a great host. Heeding the pleas for aid of the people of Clearshore, Teudur II of Ording took the Ordinger knights west to help them drive out the Reaverking. The battle of Clearshore is one of our most reputable victories, where Teudur’s knights charged the invading forces head on. The invaders had underestimated the strength of our cavalry charge and they were routed. Rangvald himself was slain during the battle.\n\nThough the battle was a great victory, Rangvald’s daughter Derhilde the Reaverqueen returned a decade later with a great host and established the Duchy of Deranne, erasing Clearshore from the map and destroying all we had worked so hard to gain. Our rivalry with Deranne over Clearshore persists to this day. If we truly wish to stake our claim to greatness, Deranne must fall under the thundering hooves of our knights.* | <li>deranne area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 20</li></ul> | [A Realm made Whole](#A17_a_realm_made_whole)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_erase_reaver_legacy">Erase the Reaver Legacy</a><br />*Deranne has fallen, and their occupation of Clearshore is finally over after six centuries of oppression. But their mark on the land remains, many Reavers came from their faraway homelands to settle Clearshore and make it their own, mixing with the local population and forming a hybrid culture, denominating themselves the Derannic.\n\nWe cannot allow these Reavers to pride themselves on the ignoble deeds of their ancestors any longer. They will learn to be Lorentish once more, and those that refuse can return to their icy homes in the north.* | <li>deranne area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 15</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>If every owned province has region is lencenor region, and  has culture is derannic:</li><ul><li>add culture construction:</li><ul><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> | [Memories of Clearshore](#A17_memories_of_clearshore)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_protect_the_coasts">Protect the Coasts</a><br />*Our conquest of the lands of Clearshore has given us access to the western seas. If there is anything we should learn from the past mistakes of the people of Clearshore, it is that an unprotected coast is one ripe for invasion by our foes. While the knights of the Great Ording are not exactly sailors, there is a great pool of potential candidates in the western shores. Many sailors who once worked for the Derannic lords are now seeking gainful employment, all that we have to provide is a vessel for them to sail and coin to feed their families.\n\nAs our budding navy forms in Westport, we should seek to topple the hegemony of the reaverlords of Reveria in the western seas. We will give them the very same treatment that they gave these shores hundreds of years ago!* | <li>num of light ship is at least 10</li><li>num of heavy ship is at least 5</li> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A05</li><li>type = cb_trade_war_triggered</li><li>months = 18250</li></ul> | [Erase the Reaver Legacy](#A17_erase_reaver_legacy)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_never_again">Never Again</a><br />*Take pride, knights of Ording, for we have avenged a six hundred year old wrong! The reaverlords’ invasion broke Clearshore and the strength of the Ording, but we were able to defeat them and liberate the lands they stole from the Lorentish. Now little remains of these invaders save for ruined settlements and trinkets stashed away by wealthy traders.\n\nBut it is not enough to have defeated them. They ruled over Westport for six hundred years and the next time that we are broken this may happen all over again. We must fortify the coast, prepare ourselves for whoever or whatever comes next, and elaborate new strategies for our horsemen to apply in battle. We must ensure that no invader can break through Clearshore and cripple us again!* | <li>deranne area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>culture is low_lorentish</li></ul><li>deranne area:</li><ul><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier great_ording_never_again until otherwise removed</li><li>If deranne area has port:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_ended_raids</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Protect the Coasts](#A17_protect_the_coasts)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_farmers_and_fishermen">Farmers and Fishermen</a><br />*The people of the Shrouded Coast are quiet and reserved. Their lands are not the most productive, most are humble farmers and fishermen, their lords are the poorest in Lencenor and rarely leave their ancient mottes. This dreary place and quiet place is thought best forgotten by the Kings of Lorent.\n\nThey are, nonetheless, a part of old Enteben. They are deserving of law, justice and charity just like any other peoples in our realm. We will revitalise the region as we did with Darom, reconnect it with the rest of Lencenor, listen to their plights and remind them of how, long ago, our peoples lived together under the banner of old Enteben.* | <li>shrouded coast area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>shrouded coast area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_low_lorentish_liberation</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Those Left Behind](#A17_those_left_behind)<br />[Never Again](#A17_never_again)<br />[Maugun's People](#A17_mauguns_people)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_restoration_of_enteben">Restoration of Enteben</a><br />*For too long have the lords of Lorent thought of themselves as above the peasant and their plights, leaving them to suffer and starve while they live in abject luxury. Finally, the people of western Lencenor are once more united. No longer can the Kings of Lorent claim that they have authority over these lands, as we have brought them together and given them renewed purpose. No longer shall we be known as apathetic remnants of a bygone age. The people of Enteben are once more riding together towards a shared destiny, unshackled by the courts of the east and their frivolous disregard for their poorer subjects.\n\nThe Ordinger knight, nay, the Entebenic knight, remembers a time when they were as poor as those they now call their vassals. Their nobility is not granted by the blood of their parents, but by their deeds and their dedication to chivalric values. Here, even the poorest peasant, if shown to be valiant, can rise to knighthood and serve the purposes of their lords.\n\nWe are the worthy lords of a new Enteben. The hooves of our horses shall make the homelands of our rivals tremble!* | <li>prestige is at least 50</li> | <li>set country flag [formed_enteben](../flags/formed_enteben.md)</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>override country name = ENTEBEN</li><li>If does not have government rank is 2:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 2</li></ul><li>If lower bloodwine area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lower winebay area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = great_ording_no_form_lorent_tt</li> | [Farmers and Fishermen](#A17_farmers_and_fishermen)<br /> |

| <a name="A17_break_rubenaire">Break Rubenaire</a><br />*The city and castle of Rubenaire are the gateways to the Southern Flats.

| <a name="A17_fields_of_enteben">Fields of Enteben</a><br />*When Lorenan died, his kingdom was split into three; Enteben, Redfort and Carneter. The Entebenic tribes dominated the western flatlands of Lencenor and were ruled by his most able riders. The Entebenic horsemen were feared across Cannor, and every man, woman and child knew how to ride a horse.\n\nThe traditions of these ages past remained alive in the Great Ording, and now that we control the flats of Lencenor, we can finally proclaim that the Ordinger knights are inheritors of Enteben’s legacy, and of Lorenan’s will!* | <li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier great_ording_reclaimed_enteben for 15 years</li> | [Break Rubenaire](#A17_break_rubenaire)<br /> |

The people of Enteben and Saddleglade were forgotten, their only use being breeding the stout Ording workhorse to work the fields of their lords. We are not Wine Lords, and we understand the legacy that these people wish to protect. Through monetary grants and a conscious effort by our administrators, we may breathe new life into the Southern Flats so that they may be proud horsemen once more and breed the finest horses for our knights. Let them know that Ording has not forgotten them, and that Enteben is poised to return!* | <li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Fields of Enteben](#A17_fields_of_enteben)<br /> |

There is no room for pedantry or upturned noses in our armies or in our nobility. Maugun himself was a lowborn soldier who deserted in the war against the Sorcerer-King after the death of his sergeant. Yet he was the one chosen by a unicorn, and he saved the Great Ording from the dark raiders of the east.\n\nWe are all Maugun’s people, inheritors of his bravery and devotion to the Ording. Every Ordinger knight knows that all that matters is to be valiant and to fight for our homeland to the very end, as their past or their ancestry does not define their identity and worth!* | <li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_low_lorentish_liberation</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>If shrouded coast area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Forgotten Folk](#A17_forgotten_folk)<br /> |

| <a name="A17_entebenic_census">Entebenic Census</a><br />*A realm does not grow prosperous on valiant knights and great deeds alone. Comprehensive and gracious day to day ruling is just as great a deed as victory in battle. Enteben has long been disunited and forgotten, we have no real knowledge of how many people live in our realm, what their trades are or how many goods and properties they have to their name. Without this knowledge, the realm rules itself while the King merely oversees and our united purpose cannot be readily achieved.\n\nNow that a new King stands on the throne of Enteben, we must reconcile the realm’s affairs with the King’s affairs. We will send administrators to each corner of the realm to quantify our resources and understand what we truly possess. With this knowledge in hand, it will be much easier for us to coordinate and revitalise the economy of the realm and gear it towards prosperity and strength.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier great_ording_performing_enteben_census for 1 years</li> | [Restoration of Enteben](#A17_restoration_of_enteben)<br /> |

A good ruler must provide for their people and not hold on to their wealth. All that we have, we have because our peasants toil for us. We must give back and invest into the lands of Enteben so our people may have an easier time in their trades and so their grievances may be heard by our administrators.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul><li>development is at least 15</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier great_ording_rewarded_the_people for 50 years</li> | [Entebenic Census](#A17_entebenic_census)<br /> |

And yet, a kingdom must rely on the common man who must be willing to give their all, for what is a kingdom without its people. When the kingdom lays in crisis, its people should be willing, eager even, to take up arms for its defence.

Indeed, if we needed any further justification that Enteben is the rightful hegemon of Lencenor, then this would do it. That doesn't mean we can rest, though!\n\nPortions of the Small Country is owned by halfling oligarchs under the pay of human magnates, considering their halfling subjects resources to spend and acquire rather than people to steward.

| <a name="A17_freedom">Freedom</a><br />*The Redfoot halflings, the first group freed by our campaigning, are already quickly settling into life within Enteben. Even though many fundamentals remain the same - they serve in our armies as the ones before, and they now pay taxes to us - it is without dispute that the deeper fundamentals have radically changed; nothing can express this better than the formal knighting of sir Freespark, the first of the halfling knights.

It is said that the old realm suffered no revolts, no discontent, for the king above them was rightfully just and brave. Having managed to establish ourselves over these lands and more, it is time to ensure the prosperity and security of all lands in Lencenor and beyond.

| <a name="A17_the_high_lords">The High Lords</a><br />*The Wine Lords are a particular issue for the Western Winebay. As their name would suggest, their lands function on wine - and nothing else. They pursue this goal to obsessive and singular ends, disregarding even the very safety of their people in order to create vintages stained with the blood of their cultivators. There are even rumours of a darker pursuit, of some wine lords using necromancy to fertilise their fields...\n\nNo longer! They will need to be scattered from their pursuits, and the most dutiful wine lords rewarded for taking the proper steps to protect their people and we will reclaim the last of Enteben’s territories.* | <li>lower bloodwine area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>lower winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>culture = high_lorentish</li><li>type = diplomat</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>cost multiplier = 0.33</li></ul> | [Restoration of Enteben](#A17_restoration_of_enteben)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_end_southern_raids">End Southern Raids</a><br />*The coast of the Winebay is host to frequent raids by gnollish slavers and a few elven pirates (despite the assurances otherwise), often striking and taking entire villages at a time before any forces are able to meaningfully retaliate. Even through its idyllic views, the coast is by-and-large in a poor state. If a few resources were put to permanent garrisons, the commoners of the area could be spared the need to defend themselves.* | <li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>lower winebay area:</li><ul><li>has coast defense building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add manpower = -5</li><li>If lower winebay area has port:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = great_ording_ended_raids</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The High Lords](#A17_the_high_lords)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_old_friends">Old Friends</a><br />*The dwarves inhabiting Rubyhold can be likened to a kindly grandfather, watching the younger states of the region squabble and battle without the strength to stand up and stop them. Their relations can be well summarised by a desire to keep the status quo, as considered by their patronage of Lorent. Now that we have defeated the old hegemon and have usurped their place, it should be a simple (if somewhere difficult) matter to bring the Ruby Dwarves around to our side.* | <li>A20:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>Country is Lorent</li></ul></ul></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Rubyhold</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul> | <li>add historical friend = A20</li><li>A20:</li><ul><li>remove historical friend = A01</li><li>add historical friend = ROOT</li></ul><li>A01:</li><ul><li>remove historical friend = A20</li></ul> | [A Lone Rose](#A17_a_lone_rose)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_edge_of_the_empire">Edge of the Empire</a><br />*Found just to our east is the Empire of Anbennar, a not-so-united land of squabbling lordlets. Many of the lands on the western Dameshead, Enteben's area of interest, are particularly disunited. Even so, they can still field substantial armies, and fall under the protection of their emperor. It is our duty to liberate them from this disunity and uncertainty - but it will take a mighty army!* | <li>army size is at least 50</li> | <li>If carneteria area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Rosefall](#A17_rosefall)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_counts_dukes_kings">Counts. Dukes, Kings</a><br />*It was a climactic squabble, but the myriad princes of Carneteria have come under our lordship. Though much of the local nobility is of belligerent character, they are good stewards to their subjects and do not place them in undue peril. In order to complete their integration, we will need to rid them of the titles they currently possess and grant them new recognition in our state. This way, Carneteria will be formally out of the domain of the empire, not just in fact.* | <li>carneteria area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>carneteria area:</li><ul><li>set in empire = no</li></ul> | [Edge of the Empire](#A17_edge_of_the_empire)<br /> |
| <a name="A17_the_third_kingdom">The Third Kingdom</a><br />*After Lorenan’s death three kingdoms were carved out of his territories and granted to his children, they were Enteben Redwood and Carneter. With Carneteria reconquered Lorenan may finally rest, knowing his sons have put their petty squabbles behind them and have been reunited into a single realm.\n\nWithin Carneter there is much and more to be done on every level from administrative to the matters of justice and even to the affairs of the local nobility. It is our duty as a just sovereign to ensure that this land is not just a stepping stone for further conquests - it is a new part of our heartlands! Once this is done, then and only then may we look to further campaigns.* | <li>carneteria area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>carneteria area:</li><ul><li>province has current tech fort trigger is yes</li></ul> | <li>carneteria area:</li><ul><li>add local autonomy = -15</li></ul><li>If wesdam area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Counts.

| <a name="A17_the_treacherous_guard">The Treacherous Guard</a><br />*Wesdam is a wretched state. It is a realm founded on deception and treachery - a betrayal of old Dameria! While some would say they were redeemed with the unexpected death of Marion Silmuna-Wesdam it is our duty to rid Lorenan’s old territories of such evil and to liberate the people suffering under their unjust rule. It will undoubtedly be better for the common people of the Dameshead if we were to take them under our righteous wing.* | <li>wesdam area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>If west dameshead region does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Third Kingdom](#A17_the_third_kingdom)<br /> |
