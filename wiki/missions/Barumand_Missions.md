| <a name="barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug">Smiths of Tamashrug</a><br />*What the Humans call 'Vernham' is quite valuable, having been home to many smiths and armouries before our brothers sacked it. We must repair the local facilities to pump out iron and blades for the armies of Barumand.\n\nThankfully our increased cooperation and integration of the Humans has allowed us to repair and improve on the local goods, and with Orcish strength the smiths of Tamashrug forge again.* | <li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has estate estate_nobles</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 65</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul></ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 45</li><li>area is vernham_area</li></ul><li>vernham area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>800:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>vernham area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = barumand_tamashrug_armouries_modifier</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>800:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = iron</li><li>add building = weapons</li></ul> | [The Long March](#barumand_long_march)<br /> |
| <a name="barumand_sharpen_blade">Sharpening the Blade</a><br />*If we wish to liberate the people of Escann from the tyrannical lords of Cannor and fear of hunger, we must first sharpen the more metaphorical blade of our armies. A well trained army shall serve us well, equipped of course, with the literal sharpened blades that our brand new smiths provide* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilisation"</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.2</li></ul><li>army tradition is at least 45</li> | <li>country gets the modifier barumand_sharpen_blade_modifier for 25 years</li> | [Smiths of Tamashrug](#barumand_smiths_of_tamashrug)<br /> |
| <a name="barumand_west_entrance">The West Entrance</a><br />*To our south lay the Deepwoods, a bane in any nation's backside. These lands are home to the Fey, and not much else is known to the inhabitants of this place, we are led to believe a contingent of Dookanson's followers ended up in this hell of mazes and leaves -- but nothing is known of their fate.\n\nWe shall build a gate in the Western Entrance, to block anyone going in, and especially block anything from coming out, for what lies in those woods may simply be waiting to strike at our farmlands.* | <li>813:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 8</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>813:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = barumand_west_gate_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Sharpening the Blade](#barumand_sharpen_blade)<br /> |
| <a name="barumand_permanent_embassies">Permanent Embassies</a><br />*The establishment of permanent embassies in our subjects will help ensure smooth relations continue.

| <a name="barumand_tamashrug_university">Tamashrug University</a><br />*Tamashrug has grown into a fledgling city in its own right, and from the day we repaired its forges and plunged it into a future of steel and blade, we have prepared it for prosperity. However every orc needs more than just an axe and armour, and Tamashrug is home to some of the brightest orcs in our nation, thanks to the Smiths’ extensive training in steel-working.\n\n. However, as we learn more about the Cannorians and their diverse lands, we have come to find that the greatest minds of these lands are the gnomes, earliest users of Artificery and the inventors of many great devices, that our richest clamor to afford. Let us seek out a group of gnomes willing to assist our fledgling nation in the construction of a great place of education, the University of Tamashrug.* | <li>800:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>full idea group is innovativeness_ideas</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>full idea group is aristocracy_ideas</li><li>full idea group  is plutocracy_ideas</li><li>full idea group   is offensive_ideas</li><li>full idea group    is defensive_ideas</li><li>full idea group     is quality_ideas</li><li>full idea group      is quantity_ideas</li><li>full idea group       is naval_ideas</li><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is barumand_gnomes_tt</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has any gnomish pop trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>largest increase of gnomish tolerance effect = yes</li><li>800:</li><ul><li>add gnomish minority size effect = yes</li><li>add gnomish minority size effect = yes</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = barumand_tamashrug_university_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add building = university</li></ul><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>add mil power = -150</li> | [Into Our Cause](#barumand_into_our_cause)<br /> |
| <a name="barumand_their_fruit">Their Fruit</a><br />*The trade and goods that flow through Eastern Cannor are generally quite appealing to the average Barumandi Orc -- because, after all, with all the food coming from our verdant fields, the Kruman can focus on luxury goods. Of course, with a little investment of money and influence, we should be able to take this trade to new heights.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 16</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is inner_castanor_region</li><li>region  is west_castanor_region</li><li>region   is south_castanor_region</li><li>area is cursewood_area</li><li>area  is whistlevale_area</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>OR:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gold</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>872:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 100</li><li>key = barumand_bonus_trade</li></ul></ul><li>840:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 100</li><li>key = barumand_bonus_trade</li></ul></ul><li>785:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 100</li><li>key = barumand_bonus_trade</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier barumand_escanni_monopoly_modifier for 25 years</li> | [Tamashrug University](#barumand_tamashrug_university)<br /> |

| <a name="barumand_below_the_wall">Push Below the Wall</a><br />*With the lands in the east of south Castanor safely in our grasp, we should secure the lands below the white walls, any possible invasion from the north and secure the gold mines near the foothills of the West Dwarovar.\n\nBut it is not enough to guard these lands, when we can ensure they prosper, restoring the damage done by the Greentide and all the adventurers that came after.* | <li>oldhaven area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>sarwood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>nortessord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>esshyl area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier barumand_slowed_conquest_modifier for 20 years</li><li>oldhaven area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>sarwood area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>nortessord area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>esshyl area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [The Long March](#barumand_long_march)<br /> |
| <a name="barumand_steady_state">The Resolute State</a><br />*After many years of conquest and rebuilding we have finally established ourselves as the hegemon of Eastern Cannor. We have risen to a position none thought orcs ever could, and as such we can push forward into the future with our power base secure.\n\nOur next step is to determine what is to be done with the rowdy and warmongering north: if we continue our path of retribution and grain output, they might end their conflicts, but the future is a mystery to all those who watch.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>legitimacy equivalent is at least 80</li><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>region is south_castanor_region</li><li>value is at least 600</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 16</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is province_is_prosperous</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = 75</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 75</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Great Dookan Unrest in Urban Centres](../events/great_dookan_unrest_in_urban_centres.md) happens</li></ul> | [The East Entrance](#barumand_east_entrance)<br />[The West Entrance](#barumand_west_entrance)<br />[Push Below the Wall](#barumand_below_the_wall)<br /> |

| <a name="barumand_let_us_in">They Let Us in</a><br />*Despite how humiliating the first Landsmeet of Barumand was, the few who did stay were interested in our proposals. The path forward is clear: a managed tribute system, where we provide protection, and they ensure steady access to a specific piece of their market.\n\nWhilst this may seem like mere plays for influence, we are merely trying to protect the Escanni people, and if we must put our men in the court of every kingdom in Escann to do so, we will do just that. But it is in our best interest that we do these things diplomatically, so let us propose this system to the neighbouring Escannis and figure out what to do with the rest later.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is barumand_border_trib_tt</li><li>all neighbor country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is south_castanor_region</li><li>region  is west_castanor_region</li><li>region   is inner_castanor_region</li><li>area is whistlevale_area</li><li>area  is cursewood_area</li></ul></ul></ul><li>total development is at least 100</li><li>is subject of type with overlord:</li><ul><li>type is tributary_state</li><li>Barumand</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = barumand_embassy_tt</li><li>custom tooltip = barumand_tributary_cb_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Missing localisation: flavour_barumand_10_t](../events/missing_localisation_flavour_barumand_10_t.md) happens</li></ul> | [Escanni Landsmeet](#barumand_landsmeet)<br /> |

Our labour is the peak of agriculture: every Orcish landowner wakes to farm, for the country, for their families and for the future of Eastern Cannor.\n\nAt least that's what our criers tell, but in truth, as advanced as our agricultural centres are, we still have to up production if we are to feed all the people of Eastern Cannor.

Our bread and wheat flows into Cannor, and  'Made in Barumand' has even become a selling point: people flock to markets in hopes of tasting our fulfilling and perfected grain.\n\nSome have even started to dub our farmers and [Ruler.GetTitle] the Grain Lords, and this title is certainly befitting of the largest producers of Grain in Cannor, producing more than even the halflings of the Small Country.* | <li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is grain</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is grain</li><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has building university</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add government reform = barumand_grain_lords_reform</li><li>If every owned province has trade goods is livestock:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul> | [Escann's Liberator](#barumand_escann_liberated)<br /> |

We have based one of our grain silos against this range of mountains as it allows us to place construction supports along it.\n\nNow, we have begun work on a Hold of Gran -- no dwarves involved. After all, this is not some dingy cavern system, but  a huge grain silo that scales the mountains near Shieldrest. And if we add some defenses to our constructions, we’ll ensure the silo never falls.* | <li>781:</li><ul><li>development is at least 45</li><li>has building ramparts</li><li>has building  university</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>777:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building ramparts</li><li>has building  university</li></ul></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier grain_diverted_1</li><li>has province modifier  grain_diverted_2</li><li>has province modifier   grain_diverted_3</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>781:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = barumand_grain_deposit_2_modifier</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = barumand_hold_of_grain_modifier</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If every owned province has trade goods is grain:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = grain_diverted_2</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Gates Upon Power](#barumand_power_gates)<br />[Lords of Grain](#barumand_grain_lord)<br /> |

Barumand will not repeat their mistake.\n\nEven in times of peace, every Barumandi Orc keeps a blade or a barrel on him in case of unseen threat. Farmers gladly report for muster when they need to, as they understand that their prosperity only exists because of their will to defend it. This may seem strange to outsiders, but in Barumand, it is just a way of life.\n\nOutsiders have taken to calling us Escann's Blade. We see this as a great compliment, because if they see us as the sword defending Escann nobody would dare make us swing.\n\n"Invading Barumand is a difficult task, as you fight through every inch of land, you come across a bush, and behind every bush, is an Orc with a freshly sharpened blade, or newly polished barrel pointing at you." - Lain Silcalas, 1654, On the Peoples of a New Escann* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>trade goods  is copper</li></ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.8</li> | <li>remove country modifier = barumand_two_servings_modifier</li><li>country gets the modifier barumand_bush_barrel_blade_modifier until otherwise removed</li> | [The Third Landsmeet](#barumand_third_landsmeet)<br /> |

These were the princapals that led our forefathers out of the Serpentspine.\n\nNow, as generation upon generation of Green Orcs grow up in Escann, our temperment has mellowed and turned their focus towards the long term. Arosha Oakbreaker, who served with Corin as part of her Circle against our ancestors in the Greentide, has become a key figure in helping move away from those traditions, passing Corin's teachings onto our young nation.\n\nShe stood tall with the burgeoning Barumandi state in its moment of weakness, and was a shining example of what orcs could become in this new green land. Aligning the state and clergy with her philosophies will help foster this shift to our new values and way of life.\n\nHonor, Tolerance, Diligence, and Bravery will be the values that every young Barumandi will strive for.
