| <a name="B62_cursewood_connections">Cursewood Castles</a><br />*The half-elf kingdom of Farraneán maintained a network of fortress-cities, called the Caseáns. The structures themselves are in ruins now, but the logic behind them remains sound regardless of the failures and mixed blood of those who built them; great fortresses, with satellite villages dedicated solely to their supply and reinforcement, shall be established in the Cursewood to defend our lands from any Ibevari elf or Arbarani mongrel daring to attack us before we are ready for the Great Reclamation.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>area is cursewood_area</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is B62_modern_fort</li><li>province has current tech fort trigger is yes</li></ul><li>is city</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Moredhal</li></ul> | <li>If random province is city, and  has area is cannwood area, and  has development is 30, and  has country or non sovereign subject holds is B62:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = moredhal_cursewood_bastion</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> |  |

| <a name="B62_heirs_of_the_berserkers">Heirs of the Berserkers</a><br />*Gerudia is ours! They fought bravely, the Gerudians, and died for their bravery. It was a fair contest… and victory was ours.\n\nMuch and more blood was shed for Gerudia, and the majority of it flowed from the Grudgeknights, who inaugurated and spearheaded this conquest. For their sacrifice, we shall deliver them Gerudia. And why not? They revere courage and violence above all else, and the Gerudians have that in spades. Gerudia, moreover, is a pure land, ruled by humans and humans alone… apart from the trolls, who will be dealt with. Our interest in the region was not sparked by those features alone, however, but by Gerudia’s position as the home of the Ebonfrost dynasty, which did so much for Castanor before the Witch King obliterated it and paved the way for the penetration of non-human filth into Cannor.\n\nOur loyal subjects, the Grudgeknights, have outlined their plans for Gerudia. The reavers - who had grown soft in their dotage - will be made hard again, and firm, as iron, through the steady destruction of the trollish element in the region. As the reavers carved out realms in Lencenor and Dameria in centuries past, so too shall our Grudgeknights become modern-day reavers, an army with a state, reshaping Gerudian society in Agrados’ image and restoring it to how it was when Black Castanor ruled./n/nAnd there are other considerations to take into account. To become a member of the Grudgeknights, one must pass a crushing array of tests and trials to be inducted into their ranks. We have received a number of complaints from them about the calibre of our people… and so it has been decided that they will be drawing from a new recruiting pool: the Olavish.* | <li>gerudian coast region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is B62_purged</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has any elven pop trigger yes</li><li>has any dwarven pop trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = grudgeknights_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>gerudian coast region:</li><ul><li>add core = B63</li><li>cede province = B63</li></ul><li>gerudia superregion:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = B63</li></ul><li>B63:</li><ul><li>change religion = infernal_court</li><li>change primary culture = moredhalic</li><li>change government = theocracy</li><li>add accepted culture = olavish</li><li>add prestige = 100</li><li>add government reform = infernal_order_state_reform</li><li>define ruler:</li><ul><li>name = "Aurgelmer"</li><li>culture = moredhalic</li><li>adm = 4</li><li>dip = 2</li><li>mil = 6</li><li>age = 34</li></ul></ul><li>B62:</li><ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = infernal_order_state_subject</li><li>subject = B63</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Northern Kin](#B62_northern_kin)<br /> |

This will be the first of seven planned temples to the Infernal Court, allowing us to centralize not only their worship but even more importantly the summoning of their devils.\n\nWe will now be able to ensure that if any infernal contracts go wrong, the damage can be contained, and if they go well we can easily take our cut.* | <li>cannwood area:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has province flag [is_agrador](../flags/is_agrador.md)</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Moredhal</li></ul> | <li>If random province has province flag is [is_agrador](../flags/is_agrador.md):</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = moredhal_agrador_temple_one</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Agroda Weaponry](#B62_agroda_weapons)<br />[Humanity's Inheritance](#B62_humanity_inheritance)<br /> |

We must remove them from the Forlorn Vale before we can safely focus on the elves, otherwise we may find ourselves the target of a new Aldresian Crusade.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 12</li><li>region is forlorn_vale_region</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Moredhal</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>422:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Moredhal</li></ul><li>423:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Moredhal</li></ul> | <li>If forlorn vale region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If alenic frontier region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Prepare Reclamation](#B62_prepare_reclamation)<br /> |

| <a name="B62_city_on_a_hill">City on a Hill</a><br />*The Damesear is ours! That puddle of a lake - once such a mighty nuisance to the old Castanorians - has been subjugated in its entirety, and our troops now man countless fortifications along its coast. The locals remain rebellious and ungrateful, but no matter; they are not our concern. Instead, we have handed this region over to the Passionates of Agrados to administer and cleanse. For too long, the Damesear has been a poisonous thorn in Cannor’s proverbial side, expediting and facilitating the spread of the elven pestilence across Halcann. It has ever been a hotbed of heresy, promulgating the degenerate “Regent Court” of Castellos in opposition to the true faith of Agrados.\n\nNo more. With the Damesear in our hands, there is no reason for us not to take drastic measures to cut this rot out at its source, and the Passionates shall serve us in this regard. The heretics and knife-ears shall be given no quarter. We plan to smoke them out like rats, and slaughter them like the vermin they are. Camps there shall be, a great multitude of them, where such undesirables shall be sacrificed, their lifeblood used as mere fuel to feed the Great Work.\n\nWhat, may one ask, is the Great Work? It is a ritual, but not just any ritual; nay, it is the Ritual. The Passionates have been labouring over this enterprise for the longest time, and claim that it has the potential to free Agrados from his subterranean prison and unleash an age of unadulterated human supremacy. We, Agrados’ most devoted followers, shall be as gods, lesser deities at his knee, treated as equals by the likes of Kazraiel and Ildran. And all that it requires… is sacrifice.\n\nNot the mere sacrifice of lives, mind, but something deeper: the sacrifice of the spirit. In their camps, the Passionates mean to break the spirits of the imprisoned. It is true that the people of the Damesear resent their confinement, imprisonment, and oppression, and that they have been searching for ways to return to a time before Moredhal, but there is no escape. Moredhal is eternal. And it is the little deaths that shall fuel Agrados’ return - the quashing of hope, the smothering of faith, the silencing of conviction.* | <li>west damesear area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Moredhal</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is B62_purged</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has any elven pop trigger yes</li><li>has any dwarven pop trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>east damesear area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is Moredhal</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is B62_purged</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has any elven pop trigger yes</li><li>has any dwarven pop trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = passionates_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>west damesear area:</li><ul><li>add core = B64</li><li>cede province = B64</li><li>change culture = moredhalic</li></ul><li>east damesear area:</li><ul><li>add core = B64</li><li>cede province = B64</li><li>change culture = moredhalic</li></ul><li>akan region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = B64</li></ul><li>businor region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = B64</li></ul><li>sornhills area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = B64</li></ul><li>sorncost vines area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = B64</li></ul><li>venail area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = B64</li></ul><li>B64:</li><ul><li>change religion = infernal_court</li><li>change primary culture = moredhalic</li><li>change government = theocracy</li><li>add prestige = 100</li><li>add government reform = infernal_order_state_reform</li><li>define ruler:</li><ul><li>name = "Morrigan"</li><li>female = yes</li><li>culture = moredhalic</li><li>adm = 5</li><li>dip = 5</li><li>mil = 3</li><li>age = 27</li></ul></ul><li>B62:</li><ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = infernal_order_state_subject</li><li>subject = B64</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Into Esmaria](#B62_into_esmaria)<br />[End of an Empire](#B62_end_of_an_empire)<br />[Into the Dameshead](#B62_into_the_dameshead)<br /> |

| <a name="B62_toxic_love">Toxic Love</a><br />*The Deepwoods are ours! A festering sore to the south of our core territories, the Triadic Devotees planned and executed the invasion on their own merits. After much bloodshed, they succeeded - and now the Deepwoods bow to Moredhal. The elves who formerly claimed to rule in these parts are currently being held in camp-complexes, awaiting their eventual death. (As far as we are concerned, they are dead already.) As for the goblins… waste not, want not. They are fast-breeding little creatures, these goblins, and will serve in the slave-factories that the Devotees are constructing in the Deepwoods. It matters not if they work quickly or slowly, for there are always more of them. What are a few hundred deaths to a race such as theirs?\n\nThe Devotees have spoken passionately about their desire to remake the Deepwoods in Moredhal’s image. They plan to purge the forest from the region, to remove the Deepwoods from the Deepwoods, and to harvest its resources in a fashion that none of its previous inhabitants were able to. To further this purpose, however, more manpower is needed. More manpower… and more brutality. And there are none whom we consider better-suited to the task than our erstwhile subjects, the orcs. They shall be inducted into the hierarchy of the new Deepwoods under their human betters and put to work extracting as much value from their goblinoid inferiors as possible. With us in charge, the Deepwoods will yield more profit than ever before!\n\nThere are, of course, other considerations; after all, the Devotees have been grumbling about “government oversight”. The Deepwoods have never been a particularly lucrative territory. Thus, if we were to hand it over to the Devotees, we would lose almost nothing in terms of taxation and other such revenues. And if they transform it into an engine of industry… well, all to the good. Moreover, we have become cognizant of the need to guard against the threat to the east - the Dwarovar. Under the Devotees, the Deepwoods will serve as a shield against the dwarves and those goblins that remain in the mountains, repelling assaults and launching punitive expeditions should it be necessary. The dwarves have had their time; if they do not lay down and accept that we rule in these parts, then we shall teach them a sharp lesson. For too long, the Deepwoods have remained out of reach to humanity. Henceforth, it will be an integral part of our race’s birthright!* | <li>west deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is B62_purged</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has any elven pop trigger yes</li><li>has any dwarven pop trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>east deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is B62_purged</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has any elven pop trigger yes</li><li>has any dwarven pop trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = devotees_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>west deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>add core = B65</li><li>cede province = B65</li></ul><li>east deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>add core = B65</li></ul><li>If east deepwoods region has owned by is B62, and has owner is subject of is B62:</li><ul><li>cede province = B65</li></ul><li>serpentreach region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = B65</li></ul><li>B65:</li><ul><li>change religion = infernal_court</li><li>change primary culture = moredhalic</li><li>add accepted culture = green_orc</li><li>change government = theocracy</li><li>add prestige = 100</li><li>add government reform = infernal_order_state_reform</li><li>define ruler:</li><ul><li>name = "Darzic"</li><li>culture = half_orc</li><li>adm = 5</li><li>dip = 2</li><li>mil = 5</li><li>age = 54</li></ul></ul><li>B62:</li><ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = infernal_order_state_subject</li><li>subject = B65</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Enter the Woods](#B62_enter_the_woods)<br /> |
