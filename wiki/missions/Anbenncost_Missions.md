| <a name="anbenncost_mobilise_watch">Mobilise the Watch</a><br />*Since the city's founding, the Anbenncóst City Watch has stood vigilant, guarding the city against threats both within and without. It has, however, never served as a true military, in times of war acting simply as a defensive force. If Anbenncóst is to emerge as a true power in the coming years, for the sake of its continued existence, the City Watch must be mobilised, not just as a police force or a garrison, but as a true army.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier anbenncost_mobilise_the_watch for 10 years</li> | [A Day in the City](#anbenncost_day_in_city)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_train_watch">Train the Watch</a><br />*Though mobilised, the City Watch is far from the quality of the armies fielded by our neighbours. It is a mere ragtag group of police officers, militias, and untrained volunteers. We must waste no time in reforming the Watch into a true fighting force, the first step in the process being to actually train them.* | <li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>add mil power = -50</li><li>country gets the modifier anbenncost_trained_watch for 10 years</li> | [Mobilise the Watch](#anbenncost_mobilise_watch)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_advance_on_temple">Advance on the Temple</a><br />*To our immediate east lies the Damish Temple. Though it bears the name and blessing of the Dame, our patron godess, this land would surely be put to better use under our control, rather than that of the local clergy. Surely, She wouldn't mind if we were to put her clergy under a little more supervision, for the sake of her mightiest city?* | <li>4:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>9:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>4:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul><li>52:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Prepare for Expansion](#anbenncost_prepare_for_expansion)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_offer_for_munas">The Offer for Munas</a><br />*Port Munas is in many ways the younger city of Anbenncóst; its people share far more in common with Anbenncósters than any other group in the empire. And yet, it remains under the control of the elven Prince-Electors of Moonhaven. Perhaps, though, a peaceful solution can be found; a large enough payment may well convince the Prince-Elector to allow us control of our sister city across the water.* | <li>52:</li><ul><li>owned by is Moonhaven</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 600</li> | <li>A31:</li><ul><li>the event [An Offer from Anbenncóst](../events/an_offer_from_anbenncost.md) happens</li></ul> | [Advance on the Temple](#anbenncost_advance_on_temple)<br /> |

| <a name="anbenncost_trade_fleet">A Fleet for Trade</a><br />*Anbenncóst is by far the largest of the cities of man, and as such, in combination with its position on Damesear, has become one of the largest trading hubs in the known world. In order to maintain this enviable position, we must defend the trade routes that flow to and from our city. This will, of course, require a larger fleet.* | <li>num of light ship is at least 8</li> | <li>country gets the modifier anbenncost_trade_fleet_modifier for 20 years</li> | [A Day in the City](#anbenncost_day_in_city)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_war_fleet">A Fleet for War</a><br />*Thanks to our city watch and mighty walls, Anbenncóst is an extremely secure city. It is, however, vulnerable still to the possibility of a naval blockade, which could well starve our city out in mere months. As such, we must expand our fleet to be able to properly contest any other naval power in the Dameshead.* | <li>num of galley is at least 8</li> | <li>country gets the modifier anbenncost_war_fleet_modifier for 10 years</li> | [A Fleet for Trade](#anbenncost_trade_fleet)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_flagship">The Pride of Anbenncóst</a><br />*Though our fleet is able to now contest that of any other in the local seas, our navy still misses one vital component; a flagship. Though we do not necessarily need a vessal such as this, building one would surely bring our fleet, and by extension our nation, great prestige.* | <li>num of heavy ship is at least 1</li> | <li>add prestige = 15</li> | [A Fleet for War](#anbenncost_war_fleet)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_prepare_for_expansion">Prepare for Expansion</a><br />*With both branches of our military reformed into a proper fighting force, the possibility has now arisen to expand our city limits. Though our neighbours may not be too pleased with the idea, we shall find it easy enough to 'convince them'. We must ensure, however, to build up our diplomatic network, to ensure that other powers, especially the Emperor, do not get involved.* | <li>diplomat is at least 1</li> | <li>If west damesear area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>9:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [The Pride of Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_flagship)<br />[Train the Watch](#anbenncost_train_watch)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_integrate_mages">Integrate the Mages</a><br />*To our north, dominating the isle of Damesear, lies the Magisterium, perhaps our greatest foe in the path of conquering the isle. With their mighty war magic, they shall surely prove to be a great threat; and yet, if we ever wish to truly be safe and secure, the mage-state must be kicked off of Damesear once and for all.* | <li>6:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>3:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>168:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>5:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Prepare for Expansion](#anbenncost_prepare_for_expansion)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_unite_damesear">Unite Damesear</a><br />*In order to finally, truly secure our place within the empire, not just as a city but as a nation, the entire island of Damesear must come under our control. Only then, when all coasts of the mighty isle are ours, can we truly feel secure behind our mighty fleets.* | <li>east damesear area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>6:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>3:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>168:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 75</li><li>add dip power = 75</li><li>add mil power = 75</li> | [Integrate the Mages](#anbenncost_integrate_mages)<br />[Advance on the Temple](#anbenncost_advance_on_temple)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_fortify_damesear">Fortify Damesear</a><br />*Though our navies are mightier, we cannot discount the possibility that they may someday fail us. As such, it is of vital importance that any potential entrances onto our isle be fortified to the greatest possible extent, giving our armies enough time to mobilise against any attackers.* | <li>168:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>168:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = damesear_fortifications</li><li>duration = 36500</li></ul></ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = damesear_fortifications</li><li>duration = 36500</li></ul></ul> | [Unite Damesear](#anbenncost_unite_damesear)<br /> |

| <a name="anbenncost_day_in_city">A Day in the City</a><br />*Mighty Anbenncóst, pride of Anbennar, greatest of the cities of the realms of Cannor, heir to old Dameria, city of the World's desire. What secrets do you hold?* |  | <li>the event [A Day in the City](../events/a_day_in_the_city.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="anbenncost_renovate_temple">Renovate the Temple District</a><br />*The mighty Temple District is home to various places of worship, from the members of the Cannorian Pantheon to monuments to dwarven ancestors and elven forebearers, to temples dedicated to both Surael and Surakel. The district is, however, rather chaotic; places of worship are constructed without any rhyme or reason, and should any other faith seek to find a home in Anbenncóst, it would struggle to simply find the space. As such, renovations of the district as a whole are surely necessary.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_renovated_temple</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A New Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_a_new_anbenncost)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_expand_forgeway">Expand Forgeway</a><br />*Forgeway is the pride and joy of the markets of Anbenncóst; as the greatest population center of dwarves in the city, it is renowned throughout Cannor for its quality workshops, with adventurers from across the world travelling here to purchase the finest weapons that crowns can buy. We should harness this prosperity, and expand Forgeway further, for what benefits one part of the city, surely benefits us all!* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_forgeway</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Modern Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_a_modern_anbenncost)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_imperial_patronage">Imperial Patronage</a><br />*In order to smooth over our expansion across the rest of Damesear, it would be prudent to get the Emperor to see the righteousness of our cause. A few well-placed platitudes should do the trick nicely.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>eoa is dismantled is yes</li><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has hre size is 1:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier anbenncost_imperial_patronage_modifier for 20 years</li></ul> | [Prepare for Expansion](#anbenncost_prepare_for_expansion)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_expand_city_limits">Expand City Limits</a><br />*Finally, after so many years, the city limits can expand beyond Anbenncóst proper. Our mighty city, so long having been cramped, forced to build inwards, can finally begin to sprawl outwards into the surrounding lands.* | <li>num of cities is at least 2</li> | <li>country gets the modifier anbenncost_expand_city_limits_modifier for 10 years</li> | [Imperial Patronage](#anbenncost_imperial_patronage)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_settle_countryside">Settle the Countryside</a><br />*Though Anbenncóst is a mighty and prosperous city it is also, admittedly, quite claustrophobic at times. As such, many within the city proper have dreams of a life out in the wide open countryside, and who are we to stop them? Though the city proper may suffer in the short-term, by encouraging this migration to the rest of Damesear, we maybe able to begin to bring the rest of our nation up to speed.* | <li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>east damesear area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>6:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>3:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>168:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>4:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>3:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>6:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>168:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_emigration</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [Expand City Limits](#anbenncost_expand_city_limits)<br />[Unite Damesear](#anbenncost_unite_damesear)<br /> |

Though we are Anbenncósters, we are also Damerians; it is time for us to decide our future.* | <li>prestige is at least 50</li> | <li>the event [The Future of the Republic](../events/the_future_of_the_republic.md) happens</li> | [Fortify Damesear](#anbenncost_fortify_damesear)<br />[Settle the Countryside](#anbenncost_settle_countryside)<br /> |

| <a name="anbenncost_a_new_anbenncost">A New Anbenncóst</a><br />*With the rediscovery by many of classical Damerian and Castanorian works, a Renaissance has begun to spread across Cannor. We must ensure that Anbenncóst move with the times, and participates in this new rebirth. An Anbenncóster Renaissance; a New Anbenncóst.* | <li>has institution renaissance</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_new_anbenncost</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Day in the City](#anbenncost_day_in_city)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_revitalise_dovemarket">Revitalise Dovemarket</a><br />*Dovemarket was one of the greatest centers of trade in the new world, and yet, following the Lilac Wars, specifically the Wexonard looting, it has fallen into disrepair. Many businesses fled the city, and parts of the market that were burned down or destroyed still have not been repaired. Though trade continues throughout the market, in order to bring back those merchants and businesses who fled Anbenncóst those years ago, repair and investment back into Dovemarket is vital.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_revitalised_market</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A New Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_a_new_anbenncost)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_a_modern_anbenncost">A Modern Anbenncóst</a><br />*With the rediscovery of Aelantir, new ideas continue to spread across Cannor. In order to stand toe-to-toe with the new colonial empires of Aelantir, as well as the revitalising Dwarven holds, Anbenncóst must bring itself into the new era.

| <a name="anbenncost_modernise_newport">Modernise Newport</a><br />*As well as serving as the main destination for ships inbound to Anbenncóst, Newport is also by far our most important shipyard. As such, in order to keep up with the needs of our ever-growing navy, the shipbuilding facilities at Newport must be modernised, bringing in modern shipbuilding techniques imported from Lencenor and the Dragon Coast.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_newport</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Modern Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_a_modern_anbenncost)<br /> |

New ideas, like the fundamental rights of all peoples of all races, of equality, of freedom, of brotherhood, have begun to spread amongst the scholars of Anbenncóst, and even amongst the people. We shall become an Anbenncóst of freedom and brotherhood; an Equal Anbenncóst.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>has idea group plutocracy_ideas</li><li>plutocracy ideas is at least 3</li> | <li>8:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = anbenncost_newport</li><li>remove province modifier = anbenncost_forgeway</li><li>remove province modifier = anbenncost_officers_academy</li><li>remove province modifier = anbenncost_modern_anbenncost</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_equal_anbenncost</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Modernise Newport](#anbenncost_modernise_newport)<br />[Expand Forgeway](#anbenncost_expand_forgeway)<br />[An Officers' Academy](#anbenncost_establish_officers_academy)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_into_the_bilge">Into the Bilge</a><br />*The Bilge is a dark stain on the reputation of Anbenncóst; at least a quarter of our fair city is part of this massive, sprawling slum. Many times, city authorities have entered the depths of the Bilge. Many times, city authorities have disappeared. This time, however, will be different. We shall work with the residents of the Bilge, promise them that they will keep their land, and work with them to turn the slums into something that is, at minimum, traversable for the residents of the rest of the city.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>add adm power = -150</li><li>the event [Time, Money, and Slums](../events/time_money_and_slums.md) happens</li> | [An Equal Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_an_equal_anbenncost)<br /> |
| <a name="anbenncost_unite_twin_academies">Unite the Twin Academies</a><br />*The Twin Academies, the Imperial Academy and the Silmuna School, are two of the greatest centers of learning not just in Anbenncóst or Anbennar, but in all of Cannor. Though the competition between the two schools can encourage progress, as their students and faculty constantly seek to outdo each other, this does not make up for the lack of progress due to their refusal to work togethor in almost any matter. As such, in order to allow progress to continue at a reasonable pace, we must force the Twin Academies to work together, whether they like it or not.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has building university</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_united_academies</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Center of Anbennar](#anbenncost_center_of_anbennar)<br /> |

New innovations, new peoples, new ideas, all have found a willing home in the city of Anbenncóst, and all have improved it even further. No other metropolis can compare; from the Porcelain Cities of the Kharunyana to the beautiful fortresses of the Lake Federation to even the mighty holds of the Dwarovar, all look toward Anbenncóst with envy.

| <a name="anbenncost_upgrade_watchtowers">Upgrade the Watchtowers</a><br />*Surrounding the city walls, at regular intervals, stand Anbenncóst's mighty watchtowers. Dating back all the way to the landing of the Remnant Fleet, and the founding of the city, many of the watchtowers were constructed in a great hurry, given the looming threat of the Sorcerer-King. As such, though strong and practical for the time, there are many flaws in their construction that were left unfixed, at first due to the need for materials in the war effort in Escann, and later, due to sheer apathy from our peaceful existence. This cannot last; the watchtowers must be brought up to modern standards.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_watchtowers</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A New Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_a_new_anbenncost)<br /> |

As such, we shall construct a new building, an officers' academy, to attract the best and brightest military minds from across Cannor, and to foster any budding military strategists already within our fair city.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_officers_academy</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A Modern Anbenncóst](#anbenncost_a_modern_anbenncost)<br /> |

| <a name="anbenncost_open_elvendocks">Elvendocks Open to All</a><br />*Elvendocks, though its elven population has long since become a minority, remains the bastion of our remaining elitist nobility. As such, the district has always been an unattainable goal for the merchants of our city; those with the means to purchase one of its majestic floating mansions are denied simply due to a lack of noble blood. By forcing the nobles to allow merchants into their midst, we can encourage more of the worlds wealthy to build themselves a home in Anbenncóst, and as such, expand the pool of those who could advise our country on matters of state.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>prestige is at least 80</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li> | <li>add dip power = -150</li><li>8:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = anbenncost_opened_elvendocks</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Center of Anbennar](#anbenncost_center_of_anbennar)<br /> |
