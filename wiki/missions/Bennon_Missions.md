| <a name="A39_havorals_dividers">Havoral's Dividers</a><br />*The Silver dwarves are descendants of ancient stone dwarves settled into the Havoral Divide by Castanor.

| <a name="A39_castle_on_the_mountain">Castle on the Mountain</a><br />*What is now called Calascandar was once one of the northernmost reaches of the Havoric Kingdom, serving a similar role as Oldpassage in linking east and west. Now one of Calasandur's Elven Castles rests here, a symbol of the forces that now occupies Havoral's lands. It will make a fine addition to our realm.* | <li>owns core province 254</li><li>owns core province  262</li> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add splendor = 200</li> | [Following The Emsar](#A39_following_the_esmar)<br /> |
| <a name="A39_asserting_our_right">Asserting Our Right</a><br />*Havoric and Esmari have always clashed in the past, one trying to assert themselves over the other. After Havoral's last King, Harold, died in battle and the Kingdom fractured, the Esmari wasted no time in picking apart the fallen realm. Bennon was all that remained as a direct link to the Kingdom, and with our ascendance in the region comes a need to assert ourselves over the Esmari once again should we ever wish to restore our Kingdom.* | <li>prestige is at least 50</li><li>owns core province 266</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is bennon_asserting_our_right_trigger_tt</li><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>primary culture is esmari</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>army size is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier bennon_asserting_our_right for 50 years</li><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul> | [Castle on the Mountain](#A39_castle_on_the_mountain)<br /> |

| <a name="A39_assessing_lilac_aftermath">Assessing Lilac Aftermath</a><br />*The Lilac Wars was both a blessing and a curse for Bennon. We fought with the Moon Party, fighting for what was right.

We now stand independent, allowing us to assert the old claims we've always remembered.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.90</li> | <li>bennonhill area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A39_havoral_tunnel">Havoral Tunnel</a><br />*The Oldpassage is the result of Dwarven colonies directed by Castanor. Although both have left the tunnel, it served as a vital strategic crossing from east and west Havoral, allowing for the old Kingdom to unify as it did.

| <a name="A39_on_the_front_foot">On the Front Foot</a><br />*The Vale was the home to many Havorics in the past, defining many myths and legends from the deep, dangerous woods here. History has not treated us well here and most Havorics are gone or fled back up the Divide.

| <a name="A39_elvish_valley">Lifting the Vale</a><br />*Much of these land's mystique has faded in modern times, with the Vale mostly known for the Moon Elves that call it home now. We shall lift this Vale, march into Ibevar and retake these woods for our clans that had to flee those many centuries ago.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is forlorn_vale_region</li></ul> | <li>south ibevar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>north ibevar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>teagansfield area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>silent repose area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>311:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [On the Front Foot](#A39_on_the_front_foot)<br /> |
| <a name="A39_ancestral_homecoming">Ancestral Homecoming</a><br />*The Vale rests in our hands now.

| <a name="A39_havoric_restoration">Havoric Restoration</a><br />*History has repeated. A ruler from Bennonhill has united the lands of the old Kingdom, marching around and even through the Divide to do so. Clan leaders prepare ceremonial bidents and advisors question what our next steps should be. Yet [Root.Monarch.GetName] knows the next step.

| <a name="A39_tales_from_yore">Tales From Yore</a><br />*The Renaissance, a time for rediscovery for much of Cannor. But for us? We have never been far from our roots, even less so for the Mountainfolk on the Divide. Even with our proactive cultural protection, the renaissance is still an opportunity to codify and spread the stories of our forefathers.* | <li>has institution renaissance</li><li>268:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier bennon_tales_from_yore for 15 years</li> |  |

With a growing movement within our elites to restore Havoral, we are reminded that there are many Havorics that have never left. We must undo their isolation so that we may learn from them.* | <li>owns core province 263</li><li>owns core province  270</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li> | <li>263:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bennon_hamlet_development</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>270:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bennon_hamlet_development</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add adm power = -50</li> | [Tales From Yore](#A39_tales_from_yore)<br />[Goatlords of Bennonhill](#A39_goat_lords_of_bennonhill)<br /> |

| <a name="A39_goat_lords_of_bennonhill">Goatlords of Bennonhill</a><br />*The Havoric Goat, a symbol of our culture. The Divide's peaks are not well suited for farming, and as such husbandry is the main source of food and clothing for these regions. Many wealthy farmers own large farms of goats, wealthiest of these farmers called 'Goatlords'. We should help them expand these operations for greater profits to the crown.* | <li>270:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>270:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bennon_goat_pastures</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |

| <a name="A39_havoric_wool_fashion">Havoric Wool Fashion</a><br />*Goats are for both food and clothing. Most traditional havoric clothing is made from goat wool, weaved thoughtfully with many cultural symbols, like a bident. Our Goatlords are interested in expanding this aspcet of the farms into proper textile operations.* | <li>270:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 12</li><li>has building textile</li></ul><li>266:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>270:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = bennon_goat_pastures</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bennon_havoric_wool_fashion</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Lowland Pastures](#A39_lowland_pastures)<br /> |
| <a name="A39_clan_mineral_prospecting">Clan Mineral Prospecting</a><br />*Since the creation of Oldpassage, the clans in the area have mined the tunnels of the Divide for hundreds of years. Now that both ends of the tunnel are in our control and the clans have returned into our fold, we may assist them in restarting these mining operations.* | <li>263:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has owner accepted culture</li><li>has owner culture</li></ul></ul><li>356:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has owner accepted culture</li><li>has owner culture</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>263:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bennon_clans_put_to_work</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>356:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bennon_clans_put_to_work</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -100</li> | [Clan Autonomy](#A39_clan_autonomy)<br /> |
| <a name="A39_havorals_riches">Havoral's Riches</a><br />*The Havoral Divide may not be the largest or richest mountain range out there, but many ore veins can be easily accessed due to the many settlements around the mountain. Our clans have already begun mining within the tunnels, and now we must mobilize them to strip the mountain bare.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>trade goods  is copper</li></ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has building weapons</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>If every owned province has trade goods is iron, and has trade goods is copper; and  has base production is 10, and  has building is weapons:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = bennon_clans_put_to_work</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -200</li> | [Clan Mineral Prospecting](#A39_clan_mineral_prospecting)<br /> |
