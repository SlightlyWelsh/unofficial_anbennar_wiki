| <a name="siadan_the_talon_and_the_pen">The Talon and the Pen</a><br />*We have been running into more and more problems as the borders of Siadan expand, and the Matriarch knows that an army is just as vulnerable to defeat off the battlefield as on it. Should we not fix this growing problem, Siadan may fracture before we can achieve our glory. Let us grant greater powers to the different flocks of Siadan, so that they may better govern our territory - a patchwork measure, to be sure, but a neccesary one.* | <li>num of cities is at least 30</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_monstrous_tribes</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_monstrous_tribes_land_rights</li> | <li>country gets the modifier siadan_patchwork_administration until otherwise removed</li> | [Triumph over the Jadd](#siadan_triumph_over_the_jadd)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_paperwork_on_the_march">Paperwork on the March!</a><br />*There is a more trivial side to our conquests - paperwork. With Siadan's borders expanding by the day, soldiers must be allocated, supply lines drawn, edicts issued... and we require an administration that is up to the task of handling all of that busywork. The tribes have proved worthy of a patchwork measure, but in truth, we need some sort of professional corps, who can stand above petty tribal squabbles.* | <li>num of cities is at least 50</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>has adm advisor 2 yes</li> | <li>remove country modifier = siadan_patchwork_administration</li><li>country gets the modifier siadan_marching_administration until otherwise removed</li> | [The Talon and the Pen](#siadan_the_talon_and_the_pen)<br /> |

| <a name="siadan_an_age_of_eclipse">An Age of Eclipse?</a><br />*The Sun Elves destroyed Siadanlen all those years ago, but now it seems that even their power is in freefall. Corruption, moral and martial decay - the time is ripe for us to march west. Some whisper of a coming age of eclipse - dark days ahead for the lands of Bulwar. And they would be right - may our feathers block out the sun!* | <li>far salahad region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>province id is at least 2913</li></ul></ul><li>azka sur area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add war exhaustion = -3</li><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = far_bulwar_region</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier siadan_our_feathers_will_eclipse_the_sun for 20 years</li> | [Triumph over the Jadd](#siadan_triumph_over_the_jadd)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_ashes_to_ashes">Ashes to Ashes</a><br />*The soldiers of the Sarelzuirs participated in Jaher's campaigns, and Eledas was one of his most esteemed generals - fine targets for the wrath of Siadan. Many of his subjects will make fine mates - the rest fine slaves - and the city? As Jexis was once 'tempered' in the flames of the Ash Palace, the Crest of Siadan will be tempered in the ashes of Sareyand. Ashes to Ashes, dust to dust. And let no sun elf forget, that if they stand against us, they will be cast into the fires as well!* | <li>far bulwar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>625:</li><ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>amount is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>add war exhaustion = -5</li><li>625:</li><ul><li>add harpy minority size effect = yes</li><li>add harpy minority size effect = yes</li><li>add devastation = 50</li><li>add base tax = -4</li><li>add base production = -4</li><li>add base manpower = -4</li></ul><li>add treasury = 150</li><li>add adm power = 200</li><li>add dip power = 200</li><li>add mil power = 200</li><li>country gets the modifier siadan_a_lesson_taught for 25 years</li><li>siadan crest upgrade = yes</li> | [An Age of Eclipse?](#siadan_an_age_of_eclipse)<br /> |

| <a name="siadan_ready_the_host">Ready the Host</a><br />*For 300 years, Siadan has sat idle, hiding along the edge of the Salahad in destitution, picking over the scraps of caravans like vultures. We are not vultures. We are harpies - and harpies do not settle for scraps. Astarta has signed a pact of blood, and the flock prepares for war - let us call the banners, ready our spears - and march to reclaim our destiny, with one word on their lips - Siadanlen!* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li> | <li>F50:</li><ul><li>If every owned province does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F47</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="siadan_crest_of_ishtara">Crest of Ishtara</a><br />*With Mulen shattered, Siadan once again stands as the undisputed true heir to the Siadunan legacy. And, befitting the new Siadan, that does not stand idle, and does not wait for it's destiny to come to it, the Matriarch has decided to do away with the useless tradition of only adding to the Crest of Ishtara on the ascension of a new leader. Instead, it's glory will grow tall with the blood of our enemies.* | <li>F50:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>F50:</li><ul><li>all core province:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier siadan_crest_of_ishtara_1 until otherwise removed</li><li>F46:</li><ul><li>If every core province does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>F49:</li><ul><li>If every core province does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Ready the Host](#siadan_ready_the_host)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_siadan_on_the_march">Siadan on the March!</a><br />*The time has come - we may have missed the battle, but the war is not over. The entire flock moves south as one mass, talons out, and ready to face their deaths, or their destiny. Siadan is on the march!* | <li>is not subject</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is year is at least 1450</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>F29:</li><ul><li>war with is Jaddari</li></ul></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is siadan_jadd_zokka_war_over_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [siadan_jadd_zokka_war_good](../flags/siadan_jadd_zokka_war_good.md)</li><li>has country flag  siadan_jadd_zokka_war_bad</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [siadan_jadd_zokka_war_good](../flags/siadan_jadd_zokka_war_good.md)</li></ul></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F46:</li><ul><li>war with is Sareyand</li></ul><li>is year is at least 1450</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>is not at war</li> | <li>country gets the modifier siadan_siadan_on_the_march_modifier until otherwise removed</li><li>If has exists is F46:</li><ul><li>declare war with cb:</li><ul><li>who = F46</li><li>casus belli = cb_monster_vs_civ</li></ul></ul> | [Crest of Ishtara](#siadan_crest_of_ishtara)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_triumph_over_the_jadd">Triumph over the Jadd</a><br />*Jaddar, Elayenna, the Desert Elves - all fools. They think their sun-god can protect them from the "malevolent dark", but when our arrows and wings eclipse their precious Surael, they shall be without recourse, and they shall be scattered, and their children shall be dashed against the stones of their holy mountain, and their legacy shall be reduced to a footnote in Siadan's rise. And when this great struggle shall be over, and the ringleaders of the Jadd adorn the path to the Mountain of Clear Sight, Siadan will looks outwards - to the west, the east... and the Crest of Ishtara will grow evermore glorious.* | <li>far east salahad area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Zokka</li></ul></ul><li>salahimil area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Zokka</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Elayenna</li></ul> | <li>add war exhaustion = -3</li><li>siadan crest upgrade = yes</li><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = azka_sur_area</li></ul><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = avhavubhiya_area</li></ul><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = far_salahad_region</li></ul> | [Siadan on the March!](#siadan_siadan_on_the_march)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_an_equal_exchange">An "Equal" Exchange</a><br />*We are bound in blood to our erstwhile allies, the sons of Zokka. However, the recent trifles between us, while very minor and insignificant, has resulted in us owning a large amount of territory populated by gnolls, but far better suited to either us Harpies, or our mates. Let us make an equal exchange - we divest ourselves of these masses, and Zokka gets a few more troops.* | <li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>F29:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is siadan_far_bulwar_gnoll_provinces_tt</li><li>far bulwar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is garpix_zokka_area</li><li>province id is at least 691</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is gnollish is yes</li></ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add war exhaustion = -3</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>medium decrease of gnollish tolerance effect = yes</li><li>custom tooltip = siadan_an_equal_exchange_trigger_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If far bulwar region has culture is gnollish is yes, and  has terrain is desert, and does not have area is garpix zokka area:</li><ul><li>change culture = surani</li><li>change religion = bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>add devastation = 50</li></ul><li>If far bulwar region has culture is gnollish is yes, and  has terrain is mountain:</li><ul><li>change culture = siadunan_harpy</li><li>change religion = the_hunt</li><li>add devastation = 50</li></ul><li>F29:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier siadan_burdened_by_refugees for 50 years</li></ul></ul> | [Blood Pact Redefined](#siadan_blood_pact_redefined)<br />[An Age of Eclipse?](#siadan_an_age_of_eclipse)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_an_age_of_siadanlen">An Age of Siadanlen</a><br />*It is done. Siadanlen is restored. Our glory knows no bounds, our legacy and status is reassured. It is time to end our endless march at last, as our battlecry takes on a different meaning - no longer one of hope, of future prospect and glory, but one of pride, of truth, and of the power we have seized for ourselves. For Siadanlen, the old queendom reformed! For the Age of Siadanlen!* | <li>is not at war</li> | <li>add war exhaustion = -5</li><li>country gets the modifier siadan_the_old_kingdom_reformed for 25 years</li><li>override country name = SIADANLEN</li><li>the event [No Rest for Siadanlen](../events/no_rest_for_siadanlen.md) happens</li><li>custom tooltip = siadan_unlock__new_missions_tt</li> | [Paperwork on the March!](#siadan_paperwork_on_the_march)<br />[Ashes to Ashes](#siadan_ashes_to_ashes)<br />[An "Equal" Exchange](#siadan_an_equal_exchange)<br />[... and then Refined](#siadan_and_then_refined)<br />[Triumph over Rakhadesh](#siadan_triumph_over_rakhadesh)<br /> |

| <a name="siadan_blood_pact_redefined">Blood Pact Redefined</a><br />*We signed a blood pact many years ago with Zokka, though a great many events got in the way of that coming to much at all.

| <a name="siadan_and_then_refined">... and then Refined</a><br />*While Zokka was admirable, it will be Siadan, not the gnolls, who ascend to glory and greatness, whose wings spread across Halann and usher in an age of 'Monsters'. The Blood Pact has been redefined, and our allies reminded of their place in the shade. They will make useful auxillaries in the wars to come.* | <li>F29:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>arrtukerr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Zokka</li></ul><li>garpix zokka area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Zokka</li></ul> | <li>If has country flag is [siadan_zokka_won](../flags/siadan_zokka_won.md):</li><ul><li>add war exhaustion = -5</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -100</li></ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = march</li><li>subject = F29</li></ul><li>If far bulwar region has owned by is F29, and does not have area is garpix zokka area:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li></ul><li>If far salahad region has owned by is F29, and does not have area is arrtukerr area:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li></ul><li>F29:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier siadan_the_blood_pact until otherwise removed</li><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = eastern_krahway_area</li></ul></ul> | [Blood Pact Redefined](#siadan_blood_pact_redefined)<br /> |

| <a name="siadan_settling_the_vale">Settling the Vale</a><br />*The 'Hero's Vale' has long been contested territory between the flocks of the Far Salahad and the Dwarves of Verkal Gulan. Now that we have sacked their hold, inflicted the greatest shame upon them, and reduced them to a mere vassal of the new Siadan, let us make some slight border adjustments, move some local populations around, and perhaps overwrite some signs in the local area. Was Astarta, who allowed our ascent, not a hero? If a dwarf were to say no, any self respecting harpy should have the right to cut their tongue out - and they should consider that express permission.* | <li>F47:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>2915:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 25</li> | <li>2915:</li><ul><li>If has owned by is F47:</li><ul><li>cede province = ROOT</li><li>remove core = F47</li></ul><li>change culture = siadunan_harpy</li><li>change religion = the_hunt</li><li>change province name = "Astarta's Vale"</li></ul><li>add dip power = -25</li> | [Ready the Host](#siadan_ready_the_host)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_gulani_relations">Gulani Relations</a><br />*We inflicted a great shame on the Gulani, but that need not define our relationship - they are, after all, rich beyond imagining, even after we slaughtered much of them and put their hold to the talon-point. Let us make amends, and invite some of their own to Siadan's Nest, so that we may put all of this behind us, and so that they will be more receptible to giving us even a small share of their fortune.* | <li>F47:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 60</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is siadan_improved_relations_tt</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is improved_relation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>F47:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>modifier = siadan_gulani_opionion</li></ul></ul><li>2904:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Orcish Private Security?](../events/orcish_private_security.md) happens</li></ul> | [Settling the Vale](#siadan_settling_the_vale)<br /> |

Let us take some of them on, so that they may be more useful to Siadan's purpose.* | <li>2904:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has dwarven minority trigger yes</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 75</li> | <li>medium increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>add dip power = -75</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = fortification_expert</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = gold_dwarf</li><li>religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [Gulani Relations](#siadan_gulani_relations)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_into_the_east">Into the East</a><br />*Half of old Siadanlen lay across the Paravimvata under Ishtara, but we lost those lands just as we lost the west, the realm shattered by Jaher, and all hope for it's return nearly lost. But with time, an opportunity has arisen - the Command. A vast host of soldiers, whose realm exists only to fuel their conquest, the hobgoblin state's similarities to this new Siadan are striking, and they would make incredible allies for our invasion into the Raj. By striking up a preliminary alliance, and making our usefulness known to the hobgoblins, we can forge a grand alliance, bound in blood, and skewer the Raj between us. While Zokka was a fool, and beneath us in truth, any harpy can see that the Command is not so. Today, they are our betters - and one day, they will be our equal.* | <li>avhavubhiya area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>owns 2913</li> | <li>add war exhaustion = -2</li><li>R62:</li><ul><li>the event [An Alliance from the Western Harpies](../events/an_alliance_from_the_western_harpies.md) happens</li></ul><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = pasiragha_area</li></ul><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = south_ghankedhen_area</li></ul><li>siadan add scope permanent claim:</li><ul><li>scope = north_ghankedhen_area</li></ul> | [Triumph over the Jadd](#siadan_triumph_over_the_jadd)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_the_second_blood_pact">Ladies of the Paravimvata</a><br />*Once, the Siadunan harpies claimed control of the entirety of the Paravimvata mountain range. The humans of the Ghankedhen lived in fear of harpy raids, and Queens of Siadanlen, Ishtara Ivoryfeather among them, descended from the mountains and waged war against the lords of Rahen. But the destruction of Siadanlen ended that nearly entirely, and Jaherian rule was subsumed by the rule of the Raj, with the Siada too weak to contest it. But the situation has changed - Siadan is on the march, and the Raj lies weak and decadent.

| <a name="siadan_triumph_over_rakhadesh">Triumph over Rakhadesh</a><br />*We have conquered the lands that Ishtara Ivoryfeather once held in Rahen, but even still this is not enough - as the Raj fractures under our advance, the city of Rayavashapal and the remainder of Rakhadesh lie open to the taking. No more will the harpies be relegated to the fringes of Rahen - let us march right up to the gates of Dhenijansar, so the Raja and his petty lords will know of the power of Siadan.* | <li>avhavubhiya area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>rakhadesh region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is The Command</li></ul></ul> | <li>add war exhaustion = -5</li><li>country gets the modifier siadan_knowledge_of_rayavashapal for 10 years</li><li>siadan crest upgrade = yes</li> | [Ladies of the Paravimvata](#siadan_the_second_blood_pact)<br /> |

The Upriver Wars have begun, and if we must drown Bulwar in blood to sieze our destiny, so be it.

But now we are a queendom, and soon we shall be an empire - and an empire does not content itself with scraps. Instead, our hunt will be one of glory, one where all harpies will strive to emulate the greatest hunters in name, and deeds, and wealth. Where land taken and blood spilt in the name of the Queen and Siadanlen will be more important than the number of trinkets taken, or the frequency of relishment.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reform level is at least 3</li><li>government is monarchy</li></ul><li>Have an advisor of type theologian</li> | <li>country gets the modifier siadan_the_new_hunt until otherwise removed</li><li>add prestige = -10</li><li>random owned province:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = the_hunt_rebels</li><li>size = 2</li></ul></ul><li>random owned province:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = the_hunt_rebels</li><li>size = 2</li></ul></ul><li>random owned province:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = the_hunt_rebels</li><li>size = 2</li></ul></ul><li>decrease monstrous 5 = yes</li> | [Proclamation of Bulwar](#siadan_proclamation_of_bulwar)<br /> |

Needless to say, these harpies do not often reproduce, and unfortunately that has led to some scorn against them. However, Siadanlen does not judge, and in difference it sees opportunity. If a harpy was not bound by any carnal desire for mates, nor motherly instinct in regards to her children, would they not be less susceptible to blackmail or persuasion? And if they were to fight side by side with their lovers, would they not be more likely to die than see themselves shamed? To strive to impress, rather than hide?

Though us harpies have never truly called the region our home, the terrain is undoubtedly suited to us, and the gnolls, being mostly immune to the charms of harpy rule, are naturally unfit to be true subjects of Siadanlen. However, it is undoubtable that Zokka's stewardship of the sands of the Salahad has rendered them signicantly weaker in both coin and land than they were before we altered our agreement - should we give the lands to them, and strengthen our blood-bonded ally?

The harem is a symbol of the majesty and glory of the monarch in comparison to other harpies, and also a nexus point for Mardik of note, whose young sons may attend the monarch in the hope that it will lead to some future promise of power, and of course that is tied intimately into the harem's reproductive purpose. But above all this, there is no doubt that the advisorial role of the harem-members is important - the Queen spends much time there, and those who attend to her at the harem are often well educated and quick of mind. And while the Great Harem at Siadunasar cannot yet hope to be a center of learning, there is no question that it will attract the most beautiful, smart and powerful mardik of the realm to it.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reform level is at least 4</li><li>government is monarchy</li></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>4411:</li><ul><li>add hobgoblin minority size effect = yes</li><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li><li>If has ROOT has country flag is [siadan_orcs_in_harem](../flags/siadan_orcs_in_harem.md):</li><ul><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>If has ROOT has country flag is [siadan_goblins_in_harem](../flags/siadan_goblins_in_harem.md):</li><ul><li>add goblin minority size effect = yes</li></ul></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = siadan_great_harem</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = diplomat</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = siadunan_harpy</li><li>religion = the_hunt</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [A Permanent Capital](#siadan_a_permanent_capital)<br />[Proclamation of Bulwar](#siadan_proclamation_of_bulwar)<br /> |

However, one look at the sheer military discipline of the Command, or the growing technological and organisational power of the Cannorians, is enough to know that this cannot continue if Siadanlen is to become the greatest empire on Halann.

However, a promising and bright young harpy has recently came to the Matriarch with a controversial yet innovative idea - with our stance against forced relishment and the greater professionalism of the army resulting in population growth decreasing, and the need for provincial garrisons to maintain both order and the control of the state increasing, why not solve both problems at once? She has developed the idea of a "Barrack-Brothel", where harpy garrison troops can allow their mates to come to them willingly, and we can even recieve a cut of the profits from the exchange. Though some in the army might balk at the idea of prostituting themselves, it seems this idea could deal with many of our problems in one stroke...* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reform level is at least 3</li><li>government is monarchy</li></ul><li>has country modifier siadan_manpower_troubles</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is rakhadesh_region</li><li>siadan valid harpy brothel province is yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is far_salahad_region</li><li>region  is far_bulwar_region</li></ul><li>siadan valid harpy brothel province is yes</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = siadan_harpy_brothels_gain_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>for:</li><ul><li>amount = 5</li><li>effect = "</li><li>If random owned province has region is rakhadesh region, and  has siadan valid harpy brothel province is yes:</li><ul><li>add harpy minority size effect = yes</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = siadan_barrack_brothel</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>for:</li><ul><li>amount = 5</li><li>effect = "</li><li>If random owned province has region is far salahad region, and has region is far bulwar region; and  has siadan valid harpy brothel province is yes:</li><ul><li>add harpy minority size effect = yes</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = siadan_barrack_brothel</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>remove country modifier = siadan_manpower_troubles</li> | [By Blood or Talon](#siadan_by_blood_or_talon)<br /> |
| <a name="siadan_intimate_connections">Intimate Connections</a><br />*The harpy's idea has been an astounding success, with these new barrack brothels both resulting in the growth of harpy populations in their local area, and forming new centers of governance and state-control - it seems that an "intimate connection" have been formed between the harpy garrisons and their Mardik clients, and any fears of backlash from the army have proven to be unfounded, the soldiers seemingly being more than alright with both making a little money on their backs, and the concept of free and easy relishment appealing greatly to them. All that is left is for us to expand this program into the new expanses of our empire, the population dense regions of the Dhenbasana and Bulwar Proper - it seems that the harpy population may grow to greater heights still...* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reform level is at least 4</li><li>government is monarchy</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is rahen_coast_region</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is harpy is yes</li></ul><li>num of units in province:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>amount is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is bulwar_proper_region</li><li>siadan valid harpy brothel province is yes</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = siadan_harpy_brothels_gain_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>for:</li><ul><li>amount = 5</li><li>effect = "</li><li>If random owned province has region is rahen coast region, and  has siadan valid harpy brothel province is yes:</li><ul><li>add harpy minority size effect = yes</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = siadan_barrack_brothel</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>for:</li><ul><li>amount = 5</li><li>effect = "</li><li>If random owned province has region is bulwar proper region, and  has siadan valid harpy brothel province is yes:</li><ul><li>add harpy minority size effect = yes</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = siadan_barrack_brothel</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier siadan_harpy_population_boom for 10 years</li><li>decrease monstrous 5 = yes</li> | [An Innovative Idea](#siadan_an_innovative_idea)<br /> |
