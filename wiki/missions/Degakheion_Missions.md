| <a name="G46_the_uneasy_truce">The Uneasy Truce</a><br />*As our border war with the Kimábhen escalated, the conniving Oktibhen struck their capital and seized their coastal holdings.

| <a name="G46_prepare_for_next_conquests">Prepare for Next Conquests</a><br />*The war with Kimánis has had a noticeable effect on the number of men that we can conscript. We should use this period of truces to rebuild our strength. Kimánis was only the first step towards the domination of the island.* | <li>manpower percentage is at least 0.75</li> | <li>If ormam area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="G46_invade_the_bay">Invade the Bay</a><br />*Directly to our south lies the great city of Ormam, its advantageous geography allowing their people to build a great harbour and dominate the trade that flows through the Cleaved Sea.

| <a name="G46_south_coast_domination">South Coast Domination</a><br />*Lokemeion is now the only obstacle left for our complete control of southern Alecand.

| <a name="G46_expand_conscription">Expand Conscription</a><br />*If we are to build a great army, we must first have the manpower to do so.

| <a name="G46_mobile_infantry">Mobile Infantry</a><br />*Warfare has long stagnated among our people, the spears and the phalanx reigning supreme for generations. This will not do!

| <a name="G46_the_warrior_kylakas">The Warrior Kylakas</a><br />*Other cities believe that their leaders should be men who can easily handle the complexity of diplomacy and trade.

| <a name="G46_kherkan_blacksmiths">Kherkan Blacksmiths</a><br />*The forges of Kherka now lie in our hands. However, many of the metalworkers refuse to labor under us. We must show that we are here not to destroy their forges, but rather to take them to heights never seen before.* | <li>2773:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building weapons</li><li>trade goods is damestear</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier degakheion_expert_blacksmiths for 50 years</li> | [Break the Fortress](#G46_break_the_fortress)<br />[The Warrior Kylakas](#G46_the_warrior_kylakas)<br /> |
| <a name="G46_a_professional_army">A Professional Army</a><br />*Our armies are now larger than any other we have crossed. Yet, this does not mean we have chosen quantity over quality, and the foolish few who dare fight us will soon discover that every soldier is as hard and tempered as the steel they carry.* | <li>army size is at least 50</li><li>army professionalism is at least 0.40</li><li>regimental camp is at least 10</li><li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is discipline</li><li>value is at least 0.15</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier degakheion_professional_army until otherwise removed</li> | [Kherkan Blacksmiths](#G46_kherkan_blacksmiths)<br /> |

| <a name="G46_the_sheperds_of_degakheion">The Shepherds of Degakheion</a><br />*Conflicts over the control of the sheep hills of central Alecand are what led us to war with the Kimábhen.

| <a name="G46_the_great_city">The Great City</a><br />*Degakheion - meaning the great city - is the beating heart of our nation, nay, of all of the Kheionai. Our current situation is deplorable; many other cities now approach the size of our capital. It is time we take part in a massive expansion project so that Degakheion may always remain greater than all others.* | <li>2736:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>2736:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "degakheion_investing_in_capital"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> | [The Shepherds of Degakheion](#G46_the_sheperds_of_degakheion)<br /> |
| <a name="G46_devandi_clothing">Devandi Clothing</a><br />*The people in our child-cities have developed an interesting style of clothing, which borrows influence from the people of Devand. This style is becoming quite popular among the Alecandi population and Devandi authorities are asking for investments in the area. We will likely profit from the increased production.* | <li>2674:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 6</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2625:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 6</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "degakheion_invested_in_subjects" for 20 years</li> | [The Great City](#G46_the_great_city)<br /> |
| <a name="G46_the_greatest_culture">The Greatest Culture</a><br />*As our capital expands and our reach across the land grows, many non-Degabhen now have come to live inside our nation, causing quite the unrest among our native population. We may be able to calm them by creating institutions which favour the Degabhen population over all the others. After all, our people must always be as great as our city.* | <li>2736:</li><ul><li>development is at least 35</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 200</li><li>culture is degabhen</li></ul> | <li>2736:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "degakheion_the_greatest_culture" until otherwise removed</li> | [Devandi Clothing](#G46_devandi_clothing)<br /> |
| <a name="G46_search_deeper">Search Deeper</a><br />*The growth of Degakheion means that few parts of the city are immune to being demolished and rebuilt. Recently, the renovation of a central amphitheatre led to a partial collapse of the floor, which uncovered an entrance to what appears to be a deep series of undiscovered tunnels. Many are eager to brave them, as the potential of finding valuable relics is tremendous. The state should take over the excavations so that we may monopolize whatever lies down there.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>2736:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>the event [The Excavation](../events/the_excavation.md) happens</li> | [The Greatest Culture](#G46_the_greatest_culture)<br /> |

| <a name="G46_reassert_control">Reassert Control</a><br />*As the bulk of our armed forces and politicians had become focused on the war with Kimánis, some Devandi settlers attempted to weaken the ties between themselves and the heartland. It would seem we have to remind them of their place.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>G55:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul><li>G56:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "degakheion_loyal_subjects" for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G46_finish_the_job">Finish the Job</a><br />*With the end of Kimánis, their child-city in Devand has declared itself to be independent. Such a ridiculous notion should be crushed lest it tempts others to do the same.* | <li>is neighbor of is Amgremos</li> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = G62</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li></ul> | [Reassert Control](#G46_reassert_control)<br /> |
| <a name="G46_encourage_degabhen_culture">Establish The Trieion</a><br />*Though subjugated, Kimábhen culture still thrives in Devand.

| <a name="G46_the_goliath">The Goliath</a><br />*The preponderance and wealth of our capital needs a symbol that represents not only our people but also our nation. A statue of a Degabhen warrior shall be built, a true §YGoliath§! which all who wish to enter our city will need to pass under.* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>2736:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>2736:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = degakheion_the_goliath</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Greatest Culture](#G46_the_greatest_culture)<br /> |
