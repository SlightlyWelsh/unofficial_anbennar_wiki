| <a name="R52_claws_extended">Claws Extended</a><br />*The tiger must know when to extend or retract its claws if it is to survive in the jungle. This lesson has not been lost on the Harimraj, nor shall it be with us. There is a time to strike, and a time to bide. It is now the former.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li> | <li>satarsaya area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4428:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4426:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="R52_finish_our_meal">Finish Our Meal</a><br />*Years ago, the Grand Vizier Manava acquired the province of Nabukh from the Prahbi of Saddathar. The weakened rump state left behind poses a substantial security risk to the Raj as it is unable to defend the eastern flank of the Raja's Vajiya holdings. It will be best if we consolidate the region ourselves - for the good of the Harimraj, of course.* | <li>owns core province 4428</li><li>owns core province  4426</li> | <li>south marutha area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4427:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add corruption = 2</li> | [Claws Extended](#R52_claws_extended)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman">Farmer and Herdsman</a><br />*The great textile centers in Vajiya are supplied by vast cotton fields to its west, currently controlled by the Prabhi of Setapsim. These fields, vital as they are, are unfortuantely highly vulnerable to raids from the Raghamadeshi and illegal grazing by the Tudhina. It is crucial that we safeguard the supply chain for this critical imperial revenue stream.* | <li>south marutha area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul><li>owns core province 4427</li> | <li>4412:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul><li>4401:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul><li>add corruption = 2</li> | [Finish Our Meal](#R52_finish_our_meal)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_a_reliable_partner">A Reliable Partner</a><br />*Our efforts in recent years have consolidated and secured the Dhenbasana basin and placed the Raj in its most secure position since the peaceful days of Shurapalar the Radiant. Our power and loyalty is well noticed by the Raja and should be appropriately honored - and what better way to celebrate this partnership than a party?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>R52:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>the event [Lord of the Feast](../events/lord_of_the_feast.md) happens</li> | [Secure the Supply Chain](#R52_secure_the_supply_chain)<br />[Farmer and Herdsman](#R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_investigate_disloyalty">Investigate Disloyalty</a><br />*Unfortunately, few of the Raja's subjects share our spirit of devotion and service. The rot that began under Golpalar the Scholar has grown unabated and threatens to kill the Raj if we do not act decisively. We must know of plots against the Lotus Throne before they happen - so we must improve the keenness of our eyes and ears. Soon we will know thoughts of treason and rebellion before they are even spoken aloud by the disloyal.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>has dip advisor 2 yes</li><li>has adm advisor 2 yes</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add corruption = -2</li> | [A Reliable Partner](#R52_a_reliable_partner)<br />[Light the Shadows](#R52_light_the_shadows)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_challenge_the_courts">Challenge the Courts</a><br />*We have assembled considerable evidence of insufficient loyalty and improprietous against the Raja amongst the courts of the realm. Laying out the case against this spirit of casual treason will ruffle some fur, but it cannot be allowed to fester.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is raj_cohesion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>R52:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li></ul></ul><li>diplomatic reputation is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_courts_challenged for 10 years</li><li>raj cohesion change absolute:</li><ul><li>amount = -15</li></ul><li>add corruption = 2</li> | [Investigate Disloyalty](#R52_investigate_disloyalty)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_illuminate_the_raj">Illuminate the Raj</a><br />*Our foes accused us of self-dealing and fabricating evidence, but in time our program has revealed the presence of enemies of the state at all levels of society. We have been proven right -- and the Raj is safer for it.* | <li>diplomatic reputation is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0.01</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_raj_illuminated for 25 years</li><li>add stability = 1</li> | [Challenge the Courts](#R52_challenge_the_courts)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_a_beacon_of_light">A Beacon of Light</a><br />*All now look to [Root.Monarch.GetName] for guidance and moral leadership, and even our foes recognize the incomparable weight of our Vizierate's authority. Our ceaseless efforts have banished the Raj's age of darkness and restored light to the realm.* | <li>prestige is at least 50</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_uppercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_uppercastes</li><li>influence is at least 20</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_middlecastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_middlecastes</li><li>influence is at least 20</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_lowercastes</li><li>influence is at least 20</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_lowercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 200</li><li>add stability = 1</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_beacon_of_light until otherwise removed</li> | [Illuminate the Raj](#R52_illuminate_the_raj)<br />[Warriors of Light](#R52_warriors_of_light)<br />[Behold the Dawn](#R52_behold_the_dawn)<br /> |

| <a name="R52_the_eastern_fields">The Eastern Fields</a><br />*East of Rabhidaraj lies the agrarian region of Satarsaya. This broad plain of horsemasters and cotton fields is divided up between squabbling landlords and corrupt administrators. Once storied cavalrymen and industrious laborers, now the Satarsaya Prahbia are little more than overreaching bandits, fallen into the common corruption of our society,  failing the people. We must move into the Satarsaya, throw out these unrighteous lords, and restore the plains to a state of order and justice as an example to the realm.* | <li>satarsaya area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul> | <li>4385:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4405:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4410:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add corruption = 2</li> | [Claws Extended](#R52_claws_extended)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_secure_the_supply_chain">Secure the Supply Chain</a><br />*The cotton fields of Inner Rahen supply the paper mills of Dhenijansar, creating the famous cotton paper that has become synonymous with the Raja's administrators and ministries. As it is so vital to the proper functioning of the state apparatus, it is only sensible to ensure these fields are directly controlled by the central government. As the only trustworthy parts of the central government are loyal to the Vizier, it is only sensible that they be controlled by us.* | <li>inner rahen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul> | <li>4412:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul><li>add corruption = 2</li><li>rhamirta area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Eastern Fields](#R52_the_eastern_fields)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_one_raj_one_vizier">One Raj, One Vizier</a><br />*Prior to the ascension of Grand Vizier Manava, it was the Senapti of Amtujsaat that historically held the Raj's highest office. Though once great, the Goldenpaw clan forgot the responsibility of righteous rule, and under their leadership the Raj decayed into its present state of decadent rot. Even now, scores of corrupt officials and noblemen yearn for the return of the Amtujsaat Vizierate. For the good of the Raj, we must crush them and ensure that the scions of Goshar Goldenpaw offer no alternative center of power for traitors to rally around.* | <li>4385:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul><li>4405:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul><li>4404:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul><li>4381:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul><li>4394:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>owned by is Dhenijanraj</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Amtujsaat</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add stability = 1</li><li>4394:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -2</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li></ul><li>4404:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -2</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li></ul><li>4381:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -2</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li></ul><li>inner rahen area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Secure the Supply Chain](#R52_secure_the_supply_chain)<br />[Farmer and Herdsman](#R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_codes_of_the_sun">Codes of the Sun</a><br />*Others mock the Radiant Sun school for its uncompromising moralism, but this is only because they have grown accustomed to the horrible decadence that Rahen has sunk into of late. The philosophers of late have not yet experienced what it means to live in a society of just people - but we can change that. The use of the Vizierate's authority can be used to promulgate new moral laws and encourage the formation of a virtuous citizenry - this will be a key plank in our plan to restore the glory of Harimar's empire.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is raj_cohesion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>R52:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = -25</li><li>add legitimacy = -25</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_uppercastes</li><li>loyalty = -50</li></ul><li>add corruption = 2</li> | [Investigate Disloyalty](#R52_investigate_disloyalty)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_warriors_of_light">Warriors of Light</a><br />*As part of our moral reform regime, we have instituted a strict but fair system of military justice. While other armies loot and pillage their way across the countryside, those flying the banner of the Bloody Claw know they fight for order and righteousness. A soldier of such virtue will always face the battle with more determination than one who fights for mere self-interest.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Rabhidaraj</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Rabhidaraj</li><li>value is at least 0.5</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>R52:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = 100</li><li>add stability = 1</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_warriors_of_light for 25 years</li> | [Codes of the Sun](#R52_codes_of_the_sun)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_knife_in_the_dark">A Knife in the Dark</a><br />*Our transformation of the Raj is nearly complete -- but it seems that even as we build a more moral society in the countryside, the halls of power are yet haunted by decadence and self-dealing. Despite all of our efforts to reform the legal system, to root out corruption, there is one final stain that keeps the Lotus Throne imperfect - The Raja. No matter how we have strained, the Rajas have never joined our crusade against corruption with as much vigor or belief as we. Can we ever hope to finish our reforms when we wear only the Red Turban of the Vizierate? When the Lotus Court itself is kept ever in the shadow? Surely... surely the greater good justifies the smaller evil of seizing control?* | <li>has reform raja_reform</li><li>stability is at least 3</li> | <li>add corruption = 5</li><li>add stability = -3</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_knife_in_the_dark for 25 years</li><li>inherit = R51</li> | [A Beacon of Light](#R52_a_beacon_of_light)<br /> |

| <a name="R52_lay_the_bait">Lay the Bait</a><br />*Simply sniffing around and attempting to catch the trail of traitors and criminals cannot possibly deal with a problem the size of the one facing the Raj today. We must actively lure them out with the promise of a fantastically lucrative yet highly illegal bargain. By spreading rumors that the Vizier's brother is open to bribery, the snakes will swarm from the shadows to seek a way into wealth and power - and we will slam the trap shut as soon as they show their treacherous tongues.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is MIL</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add corruption = 2</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_root_out_subversives for 25 years</li> | [Claws Extended](#R52_claws_extended)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_cleanse_the_filth">Cleanse the Filth</a><br />*Our scheme has succeeded beyond our wildest dreams. The band of criminals we captured was just the start -- our determined investigators have compelled these cretins into revealing their contacts across local high society. It is time to begin the arrests of the leeches who sap the lifeblood of Rahen.* | <li>corruption is at least 4</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add corruption = -2</li><li>4412:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = noble_rebels</li><li>size = 2</li></ul></ul> | [Finish Our Meal](#R52_finish_our_meal)<br />[Lay the Bait](#R52_lay_the_bait)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_light_the_shadows">Light the Shadows</a><br />*As we suspected, the rot reaches ever higher. While it is horrifying to learn from the confessions of disgraced noble leaders that they were directly aided by those among the Senaptia, it is gratifying to get closer and closer to ripping the corruption out by its roots.* | <li>Country is Rabhidaraj</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any rival country:</li><ul><li>is subject of type is great_daimyo_vassal</li></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>is subject of type is great_daimyo_vassal</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>the event [The Setapsim Affair](../events/the_setapsim_affair.md) happens</li> | [Cleanse the Filth](#R52_cleanse_the_filth)<br />[Seven Tales of Rot](#R52_seven_tales_of_rot)<br />[Farmer and Herdsman](#R52_the_farmer_and_the_herdsman)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_begin_the_cleansing">Begin the Cleansing</a><br />*The ministries were once a beacon of meritocracy and justice. In the days when they were truly institutions of merit and order, the administrative state worked for the good of the realm, and the needs of all of the castes were met. Now, however, it has become infected with parasites and the indolent scions of decadent houses. The lower castes are left without direction or aid, the middle castes are unpatronized, and the high castes find no reward for moral behavior. We must remove the termites that feast on the ministries before the whole structure comes crumbling down and we descend into anarchy.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is raj_cohesion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>R52:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = -25</li><li>add legitimacy = -25</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_raj_ministries</li><li>loyalty = -50</li></ul><li>raj cohesion change absolute:</li><ul><li>amount = -15</li></ul><li>add corruption = 4</li> | [Investigate Disloyalty](#R52_investigate_disloyalty)<br />[Scholars of Radiance](#R52_scholars_of_radiance)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_behold_the_dawn">Behold the Dawn</a><br />*Our program of ministerial reform was derided as reckless and needlessly inflammatory, but even the skeptics are taken aback by how remarkably effective the civil service has become after we purged it of its leeches. The people are again supported, able to pursue their callings and destinies, and the improved efficiency of the ministries has done much for the coffers and reputation of the Raja.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 0.01</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_raj_ministries</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_dawn_beheld for 25 years</li><li>add stability = 1</li><li>add adm power = 100</li> | [Begin the Cleansing](#R52_begin_the_cleansing)<br /> |

| <a name="R52_a_viziers_lament">A Vizier's Lament</a><br />*Our school, the Radiant Sun, has always seen sinfulness and hypocrisy in the courts of the Raj. However, the full scale of this wretched enterprise only became clear to Manava of the Bloody Claw after his ascension to the Vizierate. Perhaps the Raja merely needs to be shown that a better world is possible?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li><li>marriage with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>R52:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Lamentation Before the Sun](../events/lamentation_before_the_sun.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="R52_traveling_poets">Traveling Poets</a><br />*Our mission to transform society will require persuading the common people that they have a key role to play in building a nation of virtue. The lower castes are the builders, farmers, and sailors - the base on which all the splendor of Rahen has been built. They may have become discouraged and forgotten their incredible importance during the decades of corruption, but we must remind them of their own nobility. We shall dispatch traveling poets to bring our message to the masses through their beautiful verse, inspiring the people and restoring their belief in themselves.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is statesman</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_traveling_poets for 25 years</li> | [A Vizier's Lament](#R52_a_viziers_lament)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_seven_tales_of_rot">Seven Tales of Rot</a><br />*The 'tale of rot' is an emerging literary genre created by our cadre of traveling poets. In it, they detail the lurid stories of corruption and decadence they have observed and castigate the upper class for failing to prevent it. Now, a group of scholars has edited a collection of seven of these tales, and they have grown popular among moralists of all castes. We should ensure the widespread circulation of these tomes.* | <li>corruption is at least 4</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li><li>has dip advisor 3 yes</li><li>has adm advisor 3 yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>the event [Parusapa Moralism](../events/parusapa_moralism.md) happens</li> | [Traveling Poets](#R52_traveling_poets)<br />[Lay the Bait](#R52_lay_the_bait)<br />[Patronize Commentaries](#R52_patronize_commentaries)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_scholars_of_radiance">Scholars of Radiance</a><br />*As a relatively new branch of High Philosophy, the Radiant Sun has not historically enjoyed the scale and breadth of academic discourse as the other schools. We can correct this by establishing a central hub from which the scholars of radiance can work toward perceiving ever closer approximations of true righteousness.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>R52:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>4412:</li><ul><li>has building temple</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>the event [Parusapa Moralism](../events/parusapa_moralism.md) happens</li> | [Light the Shadows](#R52_light_the_shadows)<br />[Seven Tales of Rot](#R52_seven_tales_of_rot)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_the_colorbound_tomes">Colorbound Tomes</a><br />*The close link between the scholars of the Radiant Sun and our own rising power in the Raj has reinvigorated our school, filling our brightest minds with the sense of possibility that comes only from proximity to power. The so-called 'colorbound tomes' are the bound codices of foundational writings that have come out of Parusapa in recent years, notable for the vibrant, bright covers created with the city's famous dyes. We can ensure these tomes begin to circulate in the wider philosophical reading circles, spreading  the Radiant Sun further throughout Rahen.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has building temple</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_colorbound_tomes for 25 years</li> | [Scholars of Radiance](#R52_scholars_of_radiance)<br />[Ravinandan Method](#R52_ravinandan_method)<br /> |
| <a name="R52_the_solar_altar">The Solar Altar</a><br />*The Radiant Sun was formed when the scholars of the High Philosophy were exposed to Bulwari theology following Jaher's conquest. Though we do not in any way disavow the great contributions of our ancestors or their search for the righteous path of the High Gods, the people need a living, breathing god to bind them together. Let them turn to Surael, last living god, whose brilliant radiance casts away the shadow and turns the focus of all to the path of righteousness.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_uppercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>stability is at least 3</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add stability = -5</li><li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_solar_altar for 25 years</li><li>the event [The Cult of Surael](../events/the_cult_of_surael.md) happens</li> | [Behold the Dawn](#R52_behold_the_dawn)<br />[Colorbound Tomes](#R52_the_colorbound_tomes)<br /> |

Nevertheless, the time has come to provide a clear and stable path forward. We should summon the brightest minds of both Bulwari theology and Raheni philosophy together to discuss and debate the matters at hand.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier high_philosophy_school_origin_ascendant_soul</li><li>has province modifier  high_philosophy_school_origin_golden_palace</li><li>has province modifier   high_philosophy_school_origin_orange_sash</li><li>has province modifier    high_philosophy_school_origin_radiant_sun</li><li>has province modifier     high_philosophy_school_origin_silk_turban</li><li>has province modifier      high_philosophy_school_origin_starry_eye</li><li>has province modifier       high_philosophy_school_origin_true_school</li><li>has province modifier        high_philosophy_school_origin_unbroken_claw</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 3</li><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is the_jadd</li><li>religion  is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>religion   is old_bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Parusapa Conclave](../events/the_parusapa_conclave.md) happens</li> | [The Solar Altar](#R52_the_solar_altar)<br /> |

| <a name="R52_a_most_delicate_art">A Most Delicate Art</a><br />*Dyemaking, known in Parusapa as 'the delicate art', requires not just competence and dexterity, but also patience and calmness of mind. In this way, it is an industry that by its very nature rewards virtue - a fitting backbone for Rabhidaraj's fiscal future. The greatest limitation on growing the industry is simply that there is not enough demand for dyes, but control of cotton and the resulting textiles should solve that problem.* | <li>4412:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 12</li><li>has building marketplace</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>trade goods is cotton</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier rabhidaraj_delicate_art for 50 years</li><li>inner rahen area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="R52_ravinandan_method">Ravinandan Method</a><br />*Ravinandan was a Parusapa dyemaster and a contemporary of Grand Vizier Manava who created a vastly improved method of coloring paper. Suddenly, the creation of ornate and intricate illustrations was both more affordable and much more appealing. This method has been slowly percolating through the industry in local circles, but with our direct intervention, the surging demand for our products would bring great wealth to both Rabhidaraj and the Raja.* | <li>4412:</li><ul><li>has building workshop</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>trade goods is cotton</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_middlecastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>4412:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rabhidaraj_ravinandan_method</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = rabhidaraj_ravinandan_method</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Parade in Black and Red](#R52_parade_in_black_and_red)<br /> |
