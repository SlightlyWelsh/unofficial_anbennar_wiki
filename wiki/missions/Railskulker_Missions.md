| <a name="railskulker_rumbling_beneath_our_homes">Beneath Our Homes</a><br />*There seem to be loud metallic noises, lots of smoke, and the sound of grinding from below the hold of Er-Natvir. Sounds like these scare us but also pique our interest. Could it provide use for our military? Maybe our economy? We must find out! Several expeditions deeper were successful so going should not be a problem. We just need to hope the expedition teams don’t keep everything again…* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>development is at least 45</li></ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 2 yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>2931:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = railskulker_looking_for_the_source</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Deciphering Their Books](#railskulker_deciphering_their_books)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_going_even_deeper">Going Even Deeper</a><br />*The most honest and brave goblins have assembled to embark on a mission with the intention of increasing our knowledge for military and economic goals. They will go down way further than we have ever gone and hope to learn a lot from this, especially in the military. Although the chance to survive is little, there are plenty more goblins ready to embark on a possible suicide mission for the nation. After all, far too many goblins volunteered for this expedition so the first groups are… expendable. * | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 3 yes</li><li>has building fort_15th</li></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>has building fort_15th</li><li>development is at least 55</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Dagrite Railforge](../events/the_dagrite_railforge.md) happens</li><li>add prestige = 25</li> | [Beneath Our Homes](#railskulker_rumbling_beneath_our_homes)<br /> |

| <a name="railskulker_prepare_the_scouts">Prepare The Scouts</a><br />*We received many reports of strange sounds, minor rumbling, and sometimes some faint light in the far tunnels. Our people grow more afraid day after day, so it is necessary that we investigate these events. In response to the call for an investigation, around three thousand brave goblins, under a general, have assembled to explore some of the old tunnels and find the source of these troubling events.   * | <li>manpower is at least 3</li><li>num of generals is at least 1</li> | <li>the event [A Disaster In The Caves](../events/a_disaster_in_the_caves.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="railskulker_crushing_rubies">Crushing Rubies</a><br />*Our fallen brothers will be avenged. They have been slaughtered in a cowardly ambush set up by the stinking dwarves. Their heads will be set upon the hold as decoration and their children will be thrown off the highest place we can find. Our people will feast in that hold in honour of the fallen scouts. A first defeat is always sour, but the revenge and a first victory will be the sweetest ever tasted. To arms! * | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Ruby Company</li></ul><li>owns 4056</li> | <li>If has 4056 has culture is cave goblin:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4056:</li><ul><li>change culture = cave_goblin</li><li>change religion = goblinic_shamanism</li><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li></ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul> | [Prepare The Scouts](#railskulker_prepare_the_scouts)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_deciphering_their_books">Deciphering Their Books</a><br />*During the repair of the hold, we found plenty of new rooms we hadn’t discovered during our ransacking. The overseers of the construction only got the news after spotting hundreds of workers running off to their homes with lots of valuables from said rooms. However, when the overseers were investigating these new rooms only books and scarps remained. Some of the more intelligent goblins thought these books might provide more knowledge about the strange weapons and technology the dwarves use and used to use. Sadly we couldn’t read them yet. After a bit of investment and time, we figured out how to read a particular type of book. The ones that spoke of the lands outside the mountain ruled by men and elves. We were immediately enthusiastic about these books, especially the structures of governments mentioned within them,  although they may be far away, we could very well try to copy these governments to rule our nation much more effectively.* | <li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is ADM</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is DIP</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is MIL</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>2931:</li><ul><li>add next institution embracement = 100</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier railskulker_knowledge_of_the_outsiders for 5 years</li> | [Crushing Rubies](#railskulker_crushing_rubies)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_the_first_technocrats">The First Technocrats</a><br />*Are goblins smart? Many would answer no and our people themself would too, but the technocratic faction in our nation seems to think otherwise. They put forward ideals that, since one man is not enough to decide on important matters, include smarter goblins in the rulership of our nation and not just one single ruler.  They assembled and put forward a message to the entire nation calling on the smarter goblins to come and join their debates so they can implement their ideals and include a more intelligent backbone to our decision making.* | <li>4056:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has building marketplace</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier railskulker_the_first_technocrat_meetings for 10 years</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = natural_scientist</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = cave_goblin</li><li>discount = yes</li><li>religion = goblinic_shamanism</li></ul> | [Deciphering Their Books](#railskulker_deciphering_their_books)<br />[Farming In The Caves](#railskulker_farming_in_the_caves)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_teach_the_clanboss">Teach The Clanboss</a><br />*Recently the popularity of technocrats within our nation has grown immensely and consequently, their influence on the population has become undeniable. Their thought of one leader ruling as the only one being too unpredictable and inefficiënt  to rule runs rampant across their followers. These followers start to demonstrate in the name of the technocrats, which unintendedly boosted the popularity even more. The leader did not act on these demonstrations however and destroyed what little good the people had to say about him. As a response to the sudden outcries, the boss has invited these ‘technocrats’ to “come and teach him how to think” in an attempt to maintain the rulership and restore his popularity.* | <li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>adm power is at least 20</li><li>dip power is at least 20</li><li>mil power is at least 20</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>has adm advisor 2 yes</li><li>has dip advisor 2 yes</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>change government reform progress = 50</li><li>random list:</li><ul><li>33.4:</li><ul><li>change adm = 1</li></ul><li>33.3:</li><ul><li>change dip = 1</li></ul><li>33.3:</li><ul><li>change mil = 1</li></ul></ul> | [The First Technocrats](#railskulker_the_first_technocrats)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_recognize_the_councils">Recognize The Councils</a><br />*The technocrats have been a major asset in ruling our nation for a while now. All our holds have courthouses for the many councils to come and debate in and public speeches held by higher members of the technocratic councils occur more than once a week. The technocrats still have an issue at hand, however. The ruler still is able to make decisions on his own and takes advantage of that to keep them from the most important decisions. The technocrats plan to use their popularity as a method to increase their influence and requested the leader to come to the courthouse in Er-Natvir for a debate to do so.* | <li>4236:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 4 yes</li><li>has building courthouse</li></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>2931:</li><ul><li>has building courthouse</li><li>development is at least 65</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [An Explosion In Councils](../events/an_explosion_in_councils.md) happens</li> | [Teach The Clanboss](#railskulker_teach_the_clanboss)<br />[Going Even Deeper](#railskulker_going_even_deeper)<br />[A Hold Of Shinies](#railskulker_a_hold_of_shinies)<br /> |

| <a name="railskulker_peculiar_mushrooms">Peculiar Mushrooms</a><br />*Our goblin food stockpiles are all filled with a lot of mushrooms. This is logical because these mushrooms make up most of the food we possess, but there seems to be an unexpected side-effect. Lately, we have noticed these side effects on a large scale. Our people become calmer and more relaxed after supper, but also crave more and more. After launching an investigation, we’ve figured out that mushrooms, although edible and providing a good food source, produce effects similar to an addictive drug. Our clanboss sees potential in this and ordered the expansion of our mushroom farms.* | <li>2931:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 12</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier railskulker_a_soothing_effect until otherwise removed</li> |  |
| <a name="railskulker_fixing_what_we_broke">Fixing What We Broke</a><br />*More issues have arisen now that all of the dwarves have been taken care of. When we ransacked the dwarven hold, most of the existing hold was broken down or destroyed by our armies’ stampeding rampage and many fallen dwarves’ bodies rot on the floor. Our clanboss ordered us to clean up the mess and make the place habitable for goblins. Work has already started but this project is going to cost us.* | <li>4056:</li><ul><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 250</li> | <li>4056:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_15th</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul><li>add devastation = -100</li><li>add treasury = -150</li></ul> | [Crushing Rubies](#railskulker_crushing_rubies)<br />[Peculiar Mushrooms](#railskulker_peculiar_mushrooms)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_farming_in_the_caves">Farming In The Caves</a><br />*With the second hold now repaired and our population growing rapidly, we need to increase our food production capabilities. After a meeting, we decided that mushrooms work the best in our circumstance, partially due to their  ‘ positive’  side-effects, but also due to their ease of access, so only one question was left on the table: where? With most of the caves not producing much worth, they were decided to be the perfect place for large-scale farming.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain cavern</li><li>base production is at least 3</li><li>has building workshop</li></ul></ul> | <li>4165:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is iron, and does not have trade goods is coal, and does not have trade goods is copper, and does not have trade goods is gold, and does not have trade goods is gems, and does not have trade goods is damestear:</li><ul><li>4165:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = fungi</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "railskulker_state_backed_food_security"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>4212:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is iron, and does not have trade goods is coal, and does not have trade goods is copper, and does not have trade goods is gold, and does not have trade goods is gems, and does not have trade goods is damestear:</li><ul><li>4212:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = fungi</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "railskulker_state_backed_food_security"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>4213:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is iron, and does not have trade goods is coal, and does not have trade goods is copper, and does not have trade goods is gold, and does not have trade goods is gems, and does not have trade goods is damestear:</li><ul><li>4213:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = fungi</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "railskulker_state_backed_food_security"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Fixing What We Broke](#railskulker_fixing_what_we_broke)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_searching_for_new_mushrooms">New Mushrooms</a><br />*With our new farming projects being such a huge success, our growing populace asks for more mushrooms by the day and whilst the current increase of farms is large, it is not enough to solve the issue in its whole. Additionally, the little space we have left in caves is used for accommodation and other projects. We should explore more caves in the area and settle them so that we will have plenty of room for more farms in the future! A talented explorer with a particularly... interesting trait has already volunteered to lead exploration missions, so it seems we already have the perfect goblin for the job.* | <li>railyard area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>railyard exchange area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li> | <li>add mil power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>define conquistador:</li><ul><li>shock = 4</li><li>fire = 2</li><li>manuever = 5</li><li>name = "Gudrag Railsniffer"</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier railskulker_in_search_of_more for 25 years</li> | [Farming In The Caves](#railskulker_farming_in_the_caves)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_a_hold_of_shinies">A Hold Of Shinies</a><br />*Ever since we conquered the now-named ‘stinky ruby dwarves,’ both our military technology and power have grown severely! We control many more caves and have uncovered lots of dwarven technology! This has driven us to seek further and further into the caves and recently a group of scouts returned to the base with super super super exciting news. They found a hold full of super shiny metals! Sadly they didn’t have anything else to say about the hold, because the shiny metals distracted them from anything else.* | <li>has discovered is at least 4236</li> | <li>the event [Bring Them Home](../events/bring_them_home.md) happens</li> | [New Mushrooms](#railskulker_searching_for_new_mushrooms)<br /> |

| <a name="railskulker_extracting_relics">Extracting Relics</a><br />*We have always been a particularly inventive and resourceful species, so not only have we learned to use some of the dwarven relics, but we have also thought of ways to use them that the Dwarves could have never thought of. With our recent expeditions into the depths of the caverns we have found plenty of said relics, and perhaps we could make these relics useful to our military, even if they were never intended for that. After all, a better pickaxe is not only better at smashing rocks, but also at smashing thick skulls! And the same logic can be applied to many other artifacts.* | <li>check variable:</li><ul><li>expeditions completed var is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier railskulker_ancient_dwarven_arms for 5 years</li><li>add treasury = 500</li> | [Farming In The Caves](#railskulker_farming_in_the_caves)<br /> |

| <a name="railskulker_our_southern_brethren">Our Southern Brethren</a><br />*Our next targets to attack lay in the south but we have to be careful. Many caves and secret routes remain unexplored which increases the potential of a hostile army flanking our forces or ambushing us. Even though the many dangers scare us, the councils and clanboss decided that we can not wait any longer. After discovering a hold called Hul-Jorkad, we figured out that it is occupied by threatening forces. Luckily, our scouts noticed that the current occupants forgot or are unaware of the dwarfish defences installed so a siege will not cost too much. * | <li>2963:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>If has 2963 has culture is cave goblin:</li><ul><li>2963:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -100</li><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_16th</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>2963:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -100</li><li>change culture = cave_goblin</li><li>change religion = goblinic_shamanism</li><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_16th</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Integrate Isolated Clans](#railskulker_integrate_isolated_clans)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_take_the_vale">Take The Vale</a><br />*Our occupation of Amldihr has led us to a major discovery! There is something outside of caves and holds. Our people have stepped outside and figured out we are living in a massive formation of tall stone. Some green fields that seem to be very good farming soil have been found in this ‘outside’ world. It resembles the fields and world described in the books we read that were stolen from the dwarves. It seems that these new lands would be suitable for food production, but pesky enemies currently occupy this prime goblin estate.* | <li>serpents vale region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>4129:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>the event [A Military Occupation](../events/a_military_occupation.md) happens</li> | [Their Shiniest Possesions](#railskulker_take_their_most_prized_possesions)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_new_places_new_mushrooms">New Mushrooms</a><br />*We have managed to take control over the vale by using our superior military and some other, rather horrifying, methods. So, after we established control of the region and purged those that opposed the goblin rule over the vale, we figured out that goblins are not well liked by the other races… anyways, now all we have left to do is plant our mushrooms and see grand fields of mushrooms with great yields yearly. We can’t wait to fill the stockpiles once more because surely it won’t go wrong... right?* | <li>has country modifier railskulker_a_populous_kept_calm</li><li>serpents vale region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 5</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>the event [Room For Mushrooms?](../events/room_for_mushrooms.md) happens</li> | [Take The Vale](#railskulker_take_the_vale)<br /> |

Our scouts have noticed small but disorganized clans of other goblins under different rulers. The council and the leader debated and decided that it would be best for their safety and survival that we ‘ smart’  goblins give them a place in our nation. This could also provide more men for the army and knowledge of caves they have explored and perhaps they could own a relic or two. * | <li>backmarr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>zokkorna caverns area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>riftway area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 10 12 area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 15 17 area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>jorkad junction area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dagrinrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dagrinrod 4 6 area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Recognize The Councils](#railskulker_recognize_the_councils)<br /> |
| <a name="railskulker_deploy_mushroom_gas">Deploy Mushroom Gas</a><br />*It was a total accident but, a welcome one indeed. When our scientists were messing around whilst experimenting on the mushrooms in the hope to increase yields and make the drugging effect last longer, a particularly weird scientist started poking the mushroom tip with a stick and accidentally pierced it which produced a weird gas. All the other scientists rushed to the scene and started to take notes unaware of the fact that the gas spreads. All of them were hit and the effects could be described as a sudden burst of dizziness and then ‘super mega increased happiness’ followed by an enormous headache. The scientists could only think of one use for the gas and that was chemical warfare. To test if possible gas bombs could be used, the hold of Amldihr is going to be attacked using the gas and we hope to see some promising result…* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>amldihr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>amldihr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>dwarovrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>dagrinrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2933:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is at least 10</li></ul><li>2992:</li><ul><li>infantry in province is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has 4119 has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4119:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>the event [Funny Clouds](../events/funny_clouds.md) happens</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Integrate Isolated Clans](#railskulker_integrate_isolated_clans)<br /> |

The mushroom gas was a massive success and the gates fell open without any resistance!. As a consequence, our army ran in, ransacking and slaughtering the drugged up defenders and population. The hold is filled with blood and grief for our enemies and feasts and riches for ours! Not only have we got new sorts of weapons, but also more knowledge and even some slaves that will soon be killed off.* | <li>amldihr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [This Is Mine Now!](../events/this_is_mine_now.md) happens</li> | [Deploy Mushroom Gas](#railskulker_deploy_mushroom_gas)<br /> |

Over the last couple of years, we have also discovered the remains of the trains that were supposed to be on these tracks.

There are many protests, and such a small council is not able to fully rule over the many holds in our domain. A council member of the nation's ruling party proposed the idea of the governing council to be living in a massive train and ride around our country from hold to hold. This would mean our holds would be visited by the government and the two ruling councils could debate and improve local problems. This idea caused a lot of exciting noises coming from the council room and later on, hundreds of engineers were tasked to make this idea reality.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>has province modifier restored_rail</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has terrain dwarven_road</li><li>development is at least 8</li></ul> | <li>add government reform = railskulker_capital_on_train_tracks</li><li>set country flag [railskulker_missions_pt3](../flags/railskulker_missions_pt3.md)</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li><li>2931:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = railskulker_sharp_schedules</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "railskulker_sharper_schedules"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Their Shiniest Possesions](#railskulker_take_their_most_prized_possesions)<br />[Something Greater](#railskulker_use_for_something_greater)<br />[The Natural Next Step](#railskulker_the_natural_next_step)<br /> |

| <a name="railskulker_make_them_an_offer">Make Them An Offer</a><br />*Because we expanded our nation and conquered all the caves we know, our scouts were forced to enter new waters and explore far away caves that require weeks of preparation.
