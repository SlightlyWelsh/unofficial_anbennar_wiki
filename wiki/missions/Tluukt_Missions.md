| <a name="tluukt_jixobix_dig">The Jixobix Dig</a><br />*The steep cliffs of Jixobix have long captivated gnollkind with the tantalizing wealth buried within. Reclaimed from the region's human inhabitants in the 9th century by Jix the Goldseeker, it was the wealth of gold interred within those cliffs that fueled the expansion of gnollkind across the Šad Sur and beyond.\n\nYet, in the intervening centuries since the fall of Jix's Pack the fracturing of our tribes has resulted in the mines falling into disrepair. This can stand no longer - we shall prise once again from the Šad Sur that which it has for too long kept from us!* | <li>689:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier tluukt_golden_tongues for 20 years</li> | [Rile the Pack](#tluukt_rile_pack)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_slave_miners">Slave Miners</a><br />*The mines first carved by Jix are insufficient for our pack's needs, and we must delve deeper into the cliffs. Gnolls, however, are ill-suited to such labor, and we have thus far made extensive use of slaves seized from our Bulwari conquests.\n\nYet the Šad Sur jealously guards its treasures, making a mockery of the weak who fall prey to its dangers - and these slaves are weak indeed, dying by the droves each day. If we are to continue our exploitation of the mountain, we must first ensure a more steady supply of manpower!* | <li>689:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is slaves</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>If does not have trade goods is gold:</li><ul><li>689:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gold</li></ul></ul><li>689:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = tluukt_new_veins</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> | [The Jixobix Dig](#tluukt_jixobix_dig)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_stolen_guns">Stolen Guns</a><br />*While our pitiful predecessors bickered incessantly in the Šad Sur, the world proceeded without us. In the time since the last great gnollish conquests, war has changed. Armies tote alongside them massive tubes of iron and bronze from which they launch death at the fortresses that seek to impede their warpath.\n\nOur ignorance of these devious weapons shall persist no longer - the pirates of Drolakand have traversed the wide corners of the Divenhal, and from them we shall secure the secrets of gunpowder, and make of it proper gnollish cannons!* | <li>is not at war</li><li>F32:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>trade goods is copper</li><li>base production is at least 8</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has trade goods is copper, and  has base production is 8:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = tluukt_improvised_weapons</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier tluukt_explosive_artillery for 20 years</li> | [The Glass Pirates](#tluukt_glass_pirates)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_manipulate_cult">Manipulate the Cult</a><br />*The temples of Eduz-Vacyn are but one of many centers of elf-worship in the lands of Bulwar, and from their pulpits issue forth no end of seditious dogma that seeks to undermine the just rule of our glorious pack. Many of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s chiefest advisors have begged [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to raze the vile temple complex to the ground, to put an end to their loathsome preaching.\n\nYet this would be a terrible waste - Eduz-Vacyn is the religious heart of Bulwar, and by repairing its decaying temples and arranging a personal meeting between its priests and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] we could surely reach a more... agreeable arrangement.* | <li>F31:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>631:</li><ul><li>owned by is Eduz-Vacyn</li><li>base tax is at least 8</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Eduz-Vacyn</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = F31</li><li>value = -40</li></ul><li>If has F31 is subject of type is tributary state:</li><ul><li>vassalize = F31</li></ul><li>If does not have government is theocracy:</li><ul><li>F31:</li><ul><li>change government = theocracy</li></ul></ul><li>eduz vacyn area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F31</li></ul><li>upper suran area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F31</li></ul><li>panuses area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F31</li></ul><li>the event [Patronizing the First Temple](../events/patronizing_the_first_temple.md) happens</li> | [Gatekeeping](#tluukt_gatekeeping)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_krah_maga">Krah Maga</a><br />*Now that we have established a more productive relationship between our great pack and the priests of Eduz-Vacyn, it strikes us that there may be other ways they could be of use to us.\n\nTheir priests hold great sway over any community they preside over, and by expanding the extent of their outreach and moderating the message they preach we could find at our beck and call a legion of zealots whom we need simply point towards our mutual enemies!* | <li>631:</li><ul><li>owned by is Eduz-Vacyn</li><li>base manpower is at least 6</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>F31:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>num of cities is at least 7</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier tluukt_slave_warriors until otherwise removed</li><li>F31:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier tluukt_eduzvacyn_warriors until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [Manipulate the Cult](#tluukt_manipulate_cult)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_field_slaughter">Field of Slaughter</a><br />*The elves of Bulwar have proven a thorny problem for our pack's supremacy. They rule over their human subjects and wield them like shields, making it all too difficult to reach their delicate throats. They think themselves safe, but we think they rely overly much on the loyalty of their 'noble' subjects.\n\nAny human who consents to fight for these elf-kings simply has not yet known true fear, and once we teach them what it means to suffer we shall see where their loyalties truly lay!* | <li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>culture is elven is yes</li><li>has country modifier human_military</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture group is bulwari</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>war score against:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is -10</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If random known country has war with is ROOT, and  has religion is bulwari sun cult, and  has culture is elven is yes, and  has country modifier is human military, and  has any owned province has culture group is bulwari; and does not have war score against has who is ROOT, and war score against has value is -10:</li><ul><li>save event target as = tluukt_conscript_revolter</li></ul></ul><li>the event [Human Conscripts Revolt](../events/human_conscripts_revolt.md) happens</li> | [The Golden Spears](#tluukt_golden_spears)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_promise_partition">Promise of Partition</a><br />*The ambitions of our glorious pack in the northern reaches of Bulwar Proper are impeded by the harpies who lay claim to the hills and foothills of the region. In the elves and their human subjects we both find a mutual enemy, but we 'monsters' share little commonality in other matters, and there can be no doubt in the end that only one pack can reign supreme!\n\nEven so, a partition of Bulwar should prove to stave off this inevitable conflict long enough for us to secure our supremacy. Otherwise, we must here and now assert the superiority of our pack, so that they might never challenge it again!* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is enemy is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is enemy is Harpylen</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>trust:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 60</li></ul><li>is not at war</li></ul><li>F28:</li><ul><li>is not at war</li></ul></ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>war with is Harpylen</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Harpylen</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Harpylen</li><li>value is at least 1.5</li></ul><li>war with is Harpylen</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Harpylen</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>If has F27 has alliance with is ROOT:</li><ul><li>tooltip:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier tluukt_preparing_war for 5 years</li><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = 15</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul><li>anzarzax area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F27</li></ul><li>anzabad area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F27</li></ul></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>the event [A Promise of Partition](../events/a_promise_of_partition.md) happens</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>anzarzax area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>anzabad area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>upper brasan area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>lower brasan area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>medurubar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>irrliam area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Thronebreaker](#tluukt_thronebreaker)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_zeniths_nadir">The Zenith's Nadir</a><br />*The city of Medurubar is the heart of the loathsome Irrliam's power, the seat from which the plague of elf-worship radiates like an unsightly rot. Under the auspices of their religion they put to death countless heretics, building a 'paradise' from the bones of their subjects.\n\nIt falls upon our glorious pack to put an end to this vile institution, so that we can replace it with our own!* | <li>upper brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>lower brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>medurubar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>irrliam area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>561:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier province_razed</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Order Ransacked](../events/the_order_ransacked.md) happens</li><li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>549:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Promise of Partition](#tluukt_promise_partition)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_birsartansbar_bash">Birsartansbar Bash</a><br />*For all their ugliness, it is said that the men and women of Birsartansbar are a mirthful bunch who throw with great regularity grand celebrations, festivities they call 'masquerade balls'. Though we gnolls are all too often limited by our means, let it not be said that we don't know how to enjoy a great festival!\n\nWhile we may make for poor dance-partners, it is also said that at the conclusion of a Birsartansbar Ball a grand bonfire is held, and in this regard gnolls are experts! We shall show the people of Birsartansbar a bonfire they will never forget, in which all their ugly vanities shall burn away!* | <li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>549:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier province_razed</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Royal Artillery](../events/the_royal_artillery.md) happens</li><li>549:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = slaves</li></ul><li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Zenith's Nadir](#tluukt_zeniths_nadir)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_reclaim_akazuak">Reclaim Akaz Uak</a><br />*In the woodlands of Bahar Szel-Uak a grand kingdom once stood, long before the age of Jaher. The Tremendous Kingdom of Uak, once one of the three pillars of gnollish rule in the Bulwari Age of Monsters, was founded by Uak the Tremendous who ruled from Akaz Uak.\n\nThe Kingdom of Uak was the last of the great gnollish kingdoms to fall to the Xhazobine, yet fall it did, and in her wake the citadel of Akaz Uak was ground to dust. The squatters who dwell there now must be purged from the land, so that Akaz Uak might be reclaimed by its rightful inheritors.* | <li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>550:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>550:</li><ul><li>add devastation = -30</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>change culture = ROOT</li><li>change province name = "Akaz Uak"</li><li>rename capital = "Akaz Uak"</li></ul><li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Birsartansbar Bash](#tluukt_birsartansbar_bash)<br /> |

Its buildings are packed with the refugees of our warpath, its walls lined with the last warriors strong enough to resist us, its citadel housing the last kings who would defy us!\n\nWith its inevitable conquest, our grip over Bulwar and all its people will be ironclad, and the rule of our pack shall endure for a hundred years!* | <li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>538:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier province_razed</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Fall of Azka-Evran](../events/the_fall_of_azka_evran.md) happens</li><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Reclaim Akaz Uak](#tluukt_reclaim_akazuak)<br /> |

| <a name="tluukt_rile_pack">Rile the Pack</a><br />*The packs of the Šad Sur are a disorderly and riotous lot who not so long ago were fierce in their independence. Only the will of Tluukt binds these mountain tribes together into one great pack, but every day threatens the possibility of a tribe valuing its independence over its loyalty to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle].\n\nThese murderous urges are to be celebrated, however! Only the fiercest are fit for Tluukt, and so we must rile the packs into one murderous force, to spill out of the Šad Sur and across the realms of elf and man!* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_monstrous_tribes</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.75</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier tluukt_packs_united for 25 years</li><li>If is enemy is F27:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>the event [Gnoll Pack Rising](../events/gnoll_pack_rising.md) happens</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tluukt_monstrous_alliance">Monstrous Alliance</a><br />*With the ferocity of our pack riled against our foes, we must now go forth into Bulwar and make it our own. Yet enemies abound on every side, elf and man alike arranged against the glory of our future reign. They call us 'monster', but they do not really know what we are capable of.\n\nEven so, we must find for the time being kinship amongst our fellow 'monsters' of Bulwar. Though Zokka's pack is a powerful ally, it would be prudent to stack the odds in our favor, come any... unforeseen developments, and so we must look to others as well.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is enemy is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is enemy is Harpylen</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Harpylen</li></ul><li>F27:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Harpylen</li></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is Zokka</li></ul><li>has country modifier monstrous_nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier tluukt_diplomatic_vulnerabilities for 50 years</li> | [Rile the Pack](#tluukt_rile_pack)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_glass_pirates">The Glass Pirates</a><br />*All across Bulwar our distinguished kind are decried as savage slavers, demonic conquerors hell-bent on destroying everything right and proper! Even if some of these accusations are accurate, it makes the matter of establishing our rule a violent and protracted affair.\n\nYet, hidden amidst the rocky crags of Drolas, there are communes of Bulwari who have grown acclimated to the wisdom of gnollish order - pirate havens ruled by matriarchs who regularly have dealings with gnollish raiders. These nearly gnollish souls chafe under the boorish subjugation of elf-kings, aloof rulers who frown upon their piratical ways! Under our... protection, however, they would be free to raid the Sea of Glass to their heart's content - provided we receive our due share, of course.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Drolakand</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>inner drolas area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>inner drolas area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by PREV or its subjects</li></ul><li>is not subject</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>is not subject</li></ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 40</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>Tluukt</li><li>modifier is root_monstrous</li></ul></ul></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Drolakand</li><li>value is -50</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>Drolakand</li><li>modifier is semi_monstrous</li></ul></ul></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Drolakand</li><li>value is at least 0</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Drolakand</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has F32 is subject; and does not have overlord of is F32:</li><ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>overlord:</li><ul><li>add spy network from:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = -40</li></ul></ul><li>the event [The Blackflag Coup](../events/the_blackflag_coup.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has F32 has exists, and F32 is not subject:</li><ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>the event [An Offer of Protection](../events/an_offer_of_protection.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have exists is F32, and does not have inner drolas area has type is all, and inner drolas area has country or subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>If random known country has inner drolas area has type is all, and inner drolas area has country or subject holds is PREV; and  is not subject:</li><ul><li>add spy network from:</li><ul><li>who = F28</li><li>value = -40</li></ul></ul><li>outer drolas area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>inner drolas area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>sur mountains area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Monstrous Alliance](#tluukt_monstrous_alliance)<br /> |
| <a name="tluukt_gatekeeping">Gatekeeping</a><br />*With the western coastline of the Šad Sur now firmly under our rule, our glorious pack has done more than secure access to the Sea of Glass. We have put into our watchful oversight the confluence of Bulwar and Sarhal - the Salahad Gate.\n\nThese passes have been witness to countless migrations of goods and people, and in particular gnolls. Our forebears first travelled through these valleys to pillage the weakened Bulwari in the Age of Monsters, we were chased through here by the Castanites in their reckless purge, and from here our kind returned once Jaher’s phoenix burned out.\n\nAll very historic moments, to be certain - but no more!

| <a name="tluukt_realm_cleaver">Realm Cleaver</a><br />*In 1443 the great conquests of our glorious pack began in earnest with the subjugation of the city of Bulwar, jewel of the Bulwari. It was there that the mighty Tluukt routed their cowardly elven suzerain with the ferocity and impact of her fiery magic, leaving the city's defenders to the mercy of our rule. With great glee we smashed their walls to dust and seized their wealth as our own - yet this was not nearly enough.\n\nWe should have pursued the craven King Karodir I to the very seat of his rule and made our domination complete with the rendering of his head from his shoulders!

Even further west, more savage gnoll packs such as Viakkoc or Brrtekuh are carving themselves new territory in lands traditionally free of gnolls, finding new wealth in lands thus far unplundered.\n\nAll this to say - we no longer need Zokka.

None live now who still recall those ancient days when Bulwari lived differently, and as such gnollish rule has become a firmly established institution.\n\nWe have steadily eroded any spurious notions of independence, and we are now left with the unenlightened masses who crave the opportunity to surrender their free will for the security and prosperity guaranteed by our reign.

We live now in an age far more enlightened and moderate, however, free of past savagery. Our Bulwari subjects have become wise to the glory of our rule, and with each passing day we begin to see a little of our own greatness in them where before there was nothing.\n\nIndeed, as the spread of our reach expands across the wider world beyond Bulwar, it may now be prudent to relax the hierarchies first scrawled by the great lawgiver Tluukt. These castes were originally established not because we believed the mantle of rule fit only for gnollish shoulders, but because only gnolls had strength enough to seize it!\n\nIf our human subjects can now prove their own strength despite all the amenities afforded by blind subservience, then are they not in many ways akin to true gnolls? All humans too weak, too lacking of this essential gnollishness can still rest easy in the stability of our rule, but those few who can rise above their station may yet join the ranks of a burgeoning new pack, second only to the greatness of our very own!* | <li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 3</li><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of type is tributary_state</li></ul><li>culture is human is yes</li><li>total development is at least 100</li><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = -300</li><li>If does not have government rank is 3:</li><ul><li>set government rank = 3</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add splendor = 200</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li></ul><li>add government reform = tluukt_littlepack_reform</li><li>custom tooltip = tluukt_little_pack_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is human is yes, and  has owner accepted culture:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 20</li></ul><li>If every subject country does not have subject of type is tributary state; and  has culture is human is yes, and  has total development is 100, and does not have liberty desire is 50:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 40</li></ul></ul></ul> | [The Great Pack](#tluukt_great_pack)<br />[Krahraak of Azkabar](#tluukt_krahraak_azkabar)<br /> |

In the days of eld, when the gnollish Bulwari were content to dwell within primitive huts amidst rural crags, we cemented the bonds of blood with great trials of athleticism - a ritual that is not unfamiliar to the human Bulwari, either, though their sports differ in their technical details.
