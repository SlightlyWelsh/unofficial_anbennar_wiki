| <a name="A72_surpass_corvuria">Corvurian Relations</a><br />*Arannen has always had a tumultuous relationship with Corvuria. In some parts of history they had been fast allies sharing similar heritage and ideals standing against the might of an overbearing Anbennar, and in others, superstitious outsiders that threaten the empire's eastern borders.\n\nHistorically, during the Crimson Deluge, Princess Eléanore síl Vivin eloped with the Black Prince of Cestirbridge, Daran síl Arannen "in a love that consumed her". Daran would later unexpectedly inherit the Marquisate of Arannen and wage war for the throne of his beloved: Corvuria.* | <li>310:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>311:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>326:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Corvuria</li></ul><li>total development is Corvuria</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>total development is at least 140</li></ul> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_restore_personal_union</li><li>months = 300</li><li>target = A59</li></ul><li>If dostanor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure the North](#A72_secure_the_north)<br /> |
| <a name="A72_take_over_the_raven">Take over the Raven</a><br />*Daran and Eleanore paraded into Arca Corvur victorious and hand-in-hand.

For Corvuria and Arannen's interest, not Escann or the Empire's.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>senior union with is Corvuria</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Corvuria</li></ul><li>dostanor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is A59:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier arannen_subjugated_corvuria for 25 years</li></ul> | [Corvurian Relations](#A72_surpass_corvuria)<br /> |
| <a name="A72_integrate_the_corvurians">Integrate the Corvurians</a><br />*The Arannese people have always been close culturally to the Corvurians, often being mistaken with them by other people from the Empire.
