| <a name="eord_1_vanbury_guild">Protecting Nature's Sanctity</a><br />*Even from beyond the horizon, the stench of soot irritates us. Defiling Tor Nayyi, the Vanbury Guild has torn down the forests and burned them for fuel for belching furnaces. Worse so, the seasons themselves buckle at their wasteful ways, being perverted into unnatural events.\n\nNo more! Their wanton destruction will end, by our blade and arrow and magic!* | <li>war with is Vanbury Guild</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eor_vanbury_guild_war for 5 years</li> |  |
| <a name="eord_1_rezankand">Extinguish Burning Crusade</a><br />*Far to the south in South Aelantir, the Dawn Elves of Rezankand have carved a blazing path through Taychend and beyond. Our Ruinborn cousins have been robbed and murdered, all in the name of their all-mighty Sun God! Surael, the false god, will be torn down for his mockery of the comforting warmth of Summer!* | <li>war with is Rezankand</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eor_rezankand_war for 5 years</li> |  |
| <a name="eord_1_herbs_pixie_dust">Herbs and Pixie Dust</a><br />*Eordand has long been saturated in magic even from before the tumultous events that destroyed the Precursors long ago. Wondrous flora and fauna are found throughout the land, varying wildly even between hill and dell.\n\nDruids and mages have long prospered from these bountiful reagents, often casting magical spells to wage ware against each other. But now Eordand is united - where once our resources were spent fighting amongst ourselves, now the blessings of the Fey Lords can be used for our prosperity!* | <li>incense is at least 6</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>spices is at least 3</li><li>tobacco is at least 3</li><li>sugar is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier eor_herbs_pixie for 20 years</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_mages</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="eord_1_secure_sarmadfar">Secure the Sarmadfar</a><br />*Gouging into North Aelantir, the Sarmadfar has always glimmered brightly in the Summer's sun and moonlight. A sea of prosperity, sailed by opportunistic merchants, but sought by jealous lords and plundered by the independent Caamasi Merchant Lords.\n\nBy Ealar the Mariner, the sea shall be ridden of these dregs so that commerce may be truly free - under our control!* | <li>murdkather area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>dearktir area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>paskala area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier eord_sarmadfar_tolls for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="eord_1_stargazers">Stargazers</a><br />*Beyond the glare of the Sarmadfar to the south lies a land always seen, but yet never known by Eordan civilization. An arid and hilly land, far from the Domandrod, there has been little reason for the Caamasi to travel to such a location when they could simply sail to thriving ports elsewhere.\n\nDespite this, these lands show promise to Eordand: a great vantage point to watch for greedy foreigners. Unlike how the native Fograc watch the stars of the night sky for reasoning in their meagre lives, we shall bring meaning to this land as a first defense of Eordand from the south.* | <li>trimthir area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>anracmur area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>fogracleak area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>the event [Fate of the Fograc](../events/fate_of_the_fograc.md) happens</li><li>neankabahn area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>drabs cambann area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>gommiochand area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>sild chroolin area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure the Sarmadfar](#eord_1_secure_sarmadfar)<br />[Glorelthir Unity](#eord_2_glorelthir)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_edge_of_world">Over the Edge of the World</a><br />*While Caamasi merchants have sailed south to Alecand for centuries, the western seas have always been a dangerous mystery. Known to us as Murdfaibh, these frothing seas seemed to extend in an endless expanse of blue towards the horizon, until now.\n\nBeyond Lismel, the archipelago of Farsenn and Sardach extend further west than was previously thought. But before searching for where the sun sets, Farsenn and Sardach must be made ours, for with them we find our way back home.* | <li>eorwestislands area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>create explorer:</li><ul><li>tradition = 50</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier eord_explorer for 25 years</li> | [Stargazers](#eord_1_stargazers)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_what_lies_beyond">What Lies Beyond</a><br />*Sailing past Farsenn and Sardach is a world beyond! At first a few small islands, soon a great maelstrom of storms obscuring our path in one direction, and a great land even further past. Met with hostility at first, due to our elven resemblence, our explorers can glean little information from this exotic land.\n\nFinding themselves in the tropical clime of Arawkelin, a city with many half-elves, the Eordan are met with a warmer reception. They tell of lands even farther west and south! What wonders will be found even still?* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>kheionai superregion:</li><ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul><li>asia:</li><ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>country gets the modifier eord_beyond for 25 years</li> | [Over the Edge of the World](#eord_1_edge_of_world)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_restrain_artificers">Restrain the Artificers</a><br />*The Artificers of the Haraf, be they goblin, gnome, or kobold, all have one thing in common: an intellectual ambition that is contrary to the teachings of the Fey Lords. The proper way of Artificery is to respect the art of magic and the laws of nature, working with it instead of bending it to a purpose.\n\nWe cannot allow them to continue their destructive arts: we must teach them our wise ways, by force!* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 25</li><li>region is haraf_region</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Gommoport</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Zurzumexia</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>exists is Mestikardu</li></ul> | <li>zurzumexia area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>pontuzex area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>nauf rondi area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>manguchtec area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>warifyho area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>wili rondi area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>naarleti area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [What Lies Beyond](#eord_1_what_lies_beyond)<br />[Urdea Samrad](#eord_2_urdea_samrad)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_explore_deserts">Exploring the Haraf Desert</a><br />*A dreaded landscape hardly better than the desert to the north, inland Haraf at first glance offers little of value. Were it not for the Precursor relics that are scattered throughout Aelantir, this land would be of little use to Eordand. But search it we must, for the teachings of our ancestors must be retrieved from their earthern vault!\n\nThe Ruinborn of these lands, the Harafe named after their land, cling to ancient waterworks of the Precursors that once brought life to these lands. Only with our expertise can they be restored.* | <li>warifyho area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>wili rondi area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>naarleti area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If haraf region does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier eord_haraf_desert for 35 years</li> | [Restrain the Artificers](#eord_1_restrain_artificers)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_restore_flow">Restoring the Lifeflow</a><br />*Covered in wind-blown sands, the irrigation canals of the Precursors are in long disrepair. Only a few carry but trickles of water that the Harafe treasure more than gold.\n\nBut as we have done so before, so can we do so now: we will bring life back to this land! Comprised of highly complex enchantments, Precursor mechanisms may be understood by our Druids who have long since mastered the ways of nature and artifice. It only takes an investment to bring life back to this dying land.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>years of income is at least 1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>naarleti area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2822:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2823:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2824:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If has years of income is 1, and does not have treasury is 1500:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -1</li></ul><li>Else if has treasury is 1500:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1500</li></ul><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>country gets the modifier eord_repairing_qanats for 10 years</li><li>the event [Ancient Lifeblood of the Haraf](../events/ancient_lifeblood_of_the_haraf.md) happens</li> | [Exploring the Haraf Desert](#eord_1_explore_deserts)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_ruined_circle">Into the Ruined Circle</a><br />*An eternal reminder of the demise of the Ruinborn, and consequently our introduction to the Fey Lords, the great Ruined Circle is edged by sheer cliffs. Within the Ruin relics are sparse and often deep buried beneath the earth, as if all of the Precursors was demolished and buried. Nevertheless, this land is both cursed and blessed: powerful and terrible magic permeates this land.\n\nMany colonies of the eastern invaders are found within the Ruin, founding island and coastal communities from where they fell the woods and steal our legacy. If we are to drive off these invaders, Eordand must establish itself a point of strength from which to gather. Jutting into the sea, a mighty spit weathers the Ruined waves, guarding a harbor within. We must not squander this opportunity that Fate has given us!* | <li>1960:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is reapers_coast_region</li></ul> | <li>1960:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Cinnamgob"</li><li>rename capital = "Aracinnam"</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eord_spit_of_fate</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>dry trickster isle area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>wet trickster isle area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>isles of plenty area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Restoring the Lifeflow](#eord_1_restore_flow)<br />[Isle of Steel and Smoke](#eord_2_isle_steel_smoke)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_bloodstained_altars">Bloodstained Altars</a><br />*While Eordand is sworn to defend Aelantir and the Ruinborn, some have tempted their salvation. Namely, the Cheshoshi of the Reapers Coast have performed barbaric acts in name of their Death Cult. Sacrificing en masse, they have even managed to waste the lives of those slain, not even using their soul or body for magical use, simply left to rot!\n\nThe Reapers Coast must be seized and shown the wisdom of the Fey, for we cannot afford this stain on the reputation of the Ruinborn to persevere!* | <li>cheshosh area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>region is reapers_coast_region</li><li>religion is this nation</li><li>value is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier eord_no_more_sacrifices for 20 years</li><li>If reapers coast region does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>isles of transition area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>unstill waters area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Into the Ruined Circle](#eord_1_ruined_circle)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_center_of_ruin">Center of the Ruin</a><br />*The heart of the Ruined Circle lies deep beneath the ocean, with only rocky islands as the blasted remains of the grand capital of the Precursors. Perched on the rocks like scavengers, but ignorant of what is buried beneath, all manner of thieving pirates and demon-worshipping gnolls desecrate the living tombs of the Precursors.\n\nNo more! Their graves will be guarded by our fleets and protected with our magic, and if they recognize our authority over the Ruined Sea then they may be given a chance to correct the error of their ways.* | <li>mykx isles area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If has 1075 has fort building trigger is yes:</li><ul><li>1075:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = naval_battery</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0.5</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add mercantilism = 5</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier eord_ruined_sea_fleet until otherwise removed</li><li>ruined isles region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>endralliande region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Bloodstained Altars](#eord_1_bloodstained_altars)<br />[Promises of Prosperity](#eord_2_promises_prosperity)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_apprehend_thieves">Apprehend the Thieves</a><br />*Endralliande, strangely deserted of Ruinborn, has become a hive of the foreigners and a springboard for their theft of Aelantir. While the interior woodlands are mostly untouched, it is too late to end their settlements and plantations and the trade that they have established across the seas.\n\nIn our position of strength we must seize the gateway to Aelantir and assert our jurisdiction over Aelantir!* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>region is endralliande_region</li><li>value is at least 10</li></ul><li>1075:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier eor_apprehend_thieves until otherwise removed</li><li>ravenous isle region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>soruin region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Center of the Ruin](#eord_1_center_of_ruin)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_cousins_sun_moon">Cousins of Sun, Moon, and Elm</a><br />*During our reclamation of Aelantir, many denizens claiming to be descendants of the Precursors were found, slender of frame and with pointed ear but from seas apart. Before the appearance of the eastern thieves, the Eordan thought of ourselves as the only survivors of the Precursors, with the other Ruinborn being of further decay from our gloried past. But now - doubt strikes us, for these people live for many times our lifetime and have maintained magical traditions despite the teachings of the Fey!\n\nA wispy peace hangs over Noruin, and many have discussed the true nature of these foreign elves and their relation with us. Divergent theories clash in the lecture halls and symposiums across Eordand, with some declaring friendship with the elves, and others dismissing them as mere pretenders. Calling themselves Venaanists and Aldanists, after great figures of the Precursor Empire, these debates have manifested themselves into ever-feuding political parties. Perhaps it is time to reach out to the Elves from across the sea to learn what they may reveal about our home, so that our home may decide a path instead of bickering.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier elven_administration</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is moon_elf</li><li>primary culture  is sun_elf</li><li>primary culture   is wood_elf</li></ul></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 125</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>has building university</li><li>value is at least 4</li></ul> | <li>the event [Discourse with Distant Family](../events/discourse_with_distant_family.md) happens</li> | [Apprehend the Thieves](#eord_1_apprehend_thieves)<br /> |
| <a name="eord_1_venaan">Venaan's Teachings</a><br />*Ages ago, Venaan founded the first Precursor Empire, breaking free from the crushing grasp of the dragons. The elven race was free at last, and built the wonders and majesty of Aelantir. Spectacular art, floating cities, even rumours of venturing to the stars!\n\nAs the Sons of Venaan, we are all siblings, despite our divergent history after the fall of his empire.

The Sons of Venaan have embraced together, Ruinborn and Elf, working together to rebuild what once was. Laying brick by brick, nurturing seedlings into great trees, restoring ruined arts - only with the children of the Ruin and with the undying ones may we bring back what made our home perfect...\n\nIn the pale moonlight dancing across the parapets, reciting ancient poems to melancholy harp strings until the sun rises again - one can almost dream that our goal is complete...* | <li>stability is at least 3</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 2000</li><li>years of income is at least 2</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has building university</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul> | <li>If has years of income is 2, and does not have treasury is 2000:</li><ul><li>add years of income = -2</li></ul><li>Else if has treasury is 2000:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -2000</li></ul><li>If every owned province does not have elven majority trigger is yes; and has building is university, and has building is mage tower:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>largest increase of elven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>add accepted culture = moon_elf</li><li>add accepted culture = sun_elf</li><li>add accepted culture = wood_elf</li><li>country gets the modifier eord_aelathraithe until otherwise removed</li><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>If has culture is star elf:</li><ul><li>change culture = moon_elf</li></ul><li>If has culture is dawn elf:</li><ul><li>change culture = sun_elf</li></ul></ul> | [Venaan's Teachings](#eord_1_venaan)<br /> |

Shimmering, flickering, shining off the perfectly warm water! The lights reflect off the uncountable leaves, mystifying flowers fill the air! One could stay forever, floating on one of many giant lily pads. Fairies dart in the sky, a wonderful sight!\n\nOne might worry they may be here for malice not pleasure, but everyone knows that in the Valley of a Thousand Lights all are friends!* | <li>domandrod gladeway 3 area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>area is domandrod_gladeway_3_area</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul><li>6556:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>domandrod gladeway 3 area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eord_spring_glade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>6556:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eord_spring_city</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="eord_2_istranar">Misguided Paladins</a><br />*While their intentions may have been noble, the paladins of Istranar threaten all of the Ruinborn. Straying from the true intentions of their firey-haired goddess, they sought to extinguish evil in Aelantir, namely the Dragon Cult of the Rzentur. But they are gravely mistaken, for they only murder and cause misery when all should be diligent to the Fey Lord's will.* | <li>war with is Istranar</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eord_istranar for 5 years</li> |  |
| <a name="eord_2_neratica">Legions of Death</a><br />*A stark contrast to the knights of Istranar, Neratica's legions have always been blackened by evil. Truly outcast from their noble brethren across the seas, these so-called holy warriors have brought battle to the Cheshosh Death Cult.\n\nWhile that faith is detestable, Neratica goes beyond merely defeating evil: they have always disregarded our kind as scum! Should their lord of death exist, they will regret following him, for there is no noble afterlife for the sins they have committed!* | <li>war with is Neratica</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eord_neratica for 5 years</li> |  |
| <a name="eord_2_alchemical_security">Alchemical Security</a><br />*While having a nearly endless supply of reagents is a great boon to the alchemical arts, a standard way of practicing the art is lacking. What good are experiments if each alchemist may prepare theirs with vastly different tools, altering the results of the process?\n\nInspired by a classical spell used to clean food from poisons and toxins, glass and woodenware have been enchanted to be sterile and unreactive.

It is time to risk it all: we will descend the cliffwalls with a series of lifts and bring the fight to them! The backwoods around the cliffwalls may hide our armies, but they will not hide the massive lift structures.

An end to our wars is near!\n\nBut like how the waters of the river do not stop flowing when draining into the ocean, so to will our journey and harships never end.
