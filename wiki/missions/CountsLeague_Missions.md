| <a name="CL_reclamation">Reclamation</a><br />*We are the last remnant of the Kingdom of Castellyr, saved by the wise leadership of Carleon Blacktower and the sheer defensibility of his holdings.

| <a name="CL_ardent_glade">The Ardent Glade</a><br />*While the Oldhaven is an excellent defensive region, it isn't well-suited for growth or trade.

| <a name="CL_developing_the_glade">Developing the Glade</a><br />*With our new interim capital, the Ardent Glade is now the most appealing region for the refugees flocking to us.

| <a name="CL_putting_invaders_to_work">Putting Orcs to Work</a><br />*With the invading orcs defeated, it is best that we put them to work rebuilding the land they destroyed.
