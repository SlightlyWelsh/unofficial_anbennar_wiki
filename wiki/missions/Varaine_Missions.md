| <a name="A99_reaching_out">Reaching Out</a><br />*Our participation in the Lilac Wars as a member of the Rose Party has helped Varainé gather favor with several nations around the empire. We should foster these connections, forging alliances and other friendly relations with our former war companions.* | <li>any ally:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A99_reaching_out_req</li><li>has country flag [lilac_wars_rose_party](../flags/lilac_wars_rose_party.md)</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A99_opinion_of_varaine_150</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "A99_esmari_diplomacy" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A99_dwarves_under_our_rule">Dwarves under our Rule</a><br />*Having conquered Anvilwright and Silverforge Hall, we must now decide how we will treat the dwarves in our lands: Will we try to integrate them into Varainé society as a top-down effort, or allow them to retain their autonomy and wait for integration to come on its own?* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 308</li><li>308:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0</li></ul></ul><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  912</li><li>912:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 0</li></ul></ul> | <li>bennonhill area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Dwarven Integration](../events/dwarven_integration.md) happens</li> | [Secure our Borders](#A99_secure_our_borders)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_small_problems">Small Problems</a><br />*With Bennonhill under our control, we have come to house significant halfling and gnome communities in our lands. Like the dwarves before them, we must decide how we will try to integrate these short-folk into our society.* | <li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>area is bennonhill_area</li></ul> | <li>cann esmar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Small Problems](../events/small_problems.md) happens</li> | [Dwarves under our Rule](#A99_dwarves_under_our_rule)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_dwarves_and_orcs">Dwarves and Orcs</a><br />*The slavery and extermination of orcs in Escann - and their subsequent flight from persecution towards more tolerant places - presents Varainé with an interesting, but difficult decision. On one hand, we could accept these orcs with open arms, though this would be hard to swallow for the majority of our population and for the Dwarves under our rule. On the other hand, we could allow the orcs in our nation as laborers under the Dwarves, risking alienating their race even further, but still giving them better living conditions than as Escanni slaves.* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>prestige is at least 25</li><li>308:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li></ul><li>912:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>the event [Orcish Refugees](../events/orcish_refugees.md) happens</li> | [Small Problems](#A99_small_problems)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_pluralism">Pluralism</a><br />*With the recent expansion of Varainé, our nation has become home to various different cultures and races. It would be in our interest to incorporate these disparaging groups into our society, as our openness to new peoples may reflect well on our rule and help our nation develop in interesting directions.* | <li>num accepted cultures is at least 3</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance halfling race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance gnomish race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance half orcish race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance kobold race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance orcish race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance human race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance gnollish race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance ruinborn race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance goblin race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance harpy race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance troll race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance half elven race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance ogre race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance harimari race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance centaur race trigger is yes</li><li>high tolerance hobgoblin race trigger is yes</li><li>amount is at least 7</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add legitimacy = 10</li><li>custom tooltip = A99_pluralism_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = dwarven</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = elven</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = halfling</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = half_orcish</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = kobold</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = orcish</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = human</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = gnollish</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = ruinborn</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = goblin</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = harpy</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = troll</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = half_elven</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = ogre</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = harimari</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = centaur</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>A99 add minority if tolerated:</li><ul><li>race = hobgoblin</li><li>amount = 2</li><li>high = yes</li></ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>update racial province modifier tolerance = yes</li></ul></ul> | [Dwarves and Orcs](#A99_dwarves_and_orcs)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_multiracial_diplomacy">Multiracial Diplomacy</a><br />*The racial minorities of Varainé are growing steadily, both in terms of rights and population. Some have even reached higher positions in government. This is, of course, all to our advantage as we might just be able to use this fact to sway non-human princes to view us in a more favorable light* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is culture_is_not_human_tt</li><li>culture is human is no</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = A99_multiracial_diplomacy_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every known country has culture is human is no:</li><ul><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>modifier = A99_friendly_with_other_races</li></ul></ul></ul><li>the event [Other races in our Government](../events/other_races_in_our_government.md) happens</li> | [Pluralism](#A99_pluralism)<br /> |

| <a name="A99_present_threats">Present Threats</a><br />*Varainé's current independence is a fickle matter, as many of our neighbors are larger, more powerful, and upset at the outcome of the Lilac Wars. Foremost of these neighbors are Leslinpár, of whom Varainé used to be a domain, and Silverforge, who control the nascents of the Logrodainé. To secure our continued existence as a sovereign nation, we must present a strong face to any would be enemies, especially the dwarves and our former overlords.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is rival is Leslinpar</li><li>is rival  is Silverforge</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "A99_ready_for_war" for 15 years</li><li>high esmar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A99_secure_our_borders">Secure our Borders</a><br />*While our allies and our newfound army may help deter immediate attacks, to ensure Varainé's independence into the future we must start looking outwards. Conquering our immediate surroundings should increase our resources, and give us enough of a buffer, to help protect ourselves further into the future* | <li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>area is high_esmar_area</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owns 902</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li></ul> | <li>If does not have owns is 902:</li><ul><li>the event [A Helping Hand](../events/a_helping_hand.md) happens</li></ul><li>ashfields area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Present Threats](#A99_present_threats)<br />[Reaching Out](#A99_reaching_out)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_past_threats">Past Threats</a><br />*Though we have conquered or cut down in size our most immediate threats, many other dangers still stand between Varainé and its continued independence. Perhaps we can use our previous enemies as a warning to all would-be opponents of our nation, making their submission to our rule an example of our ability to defend ourselves.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Silverforge</li></ul><li>A73:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Leslinpar</li></ul><li>A92:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>all neighbor country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>army size is this nation</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 25</li></ul><li>add legitimacy = 10</li> | [Secure our Borders](#A99_secure_our_borders)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_charcoal_and_powder">Charcoal and Powder</a><br />*While gunpowder has been known and employed by dwarves since before the fall of Aul-Dwarov, only now is gunpowder becoming prevalent in Cannorian warfare. Varainé, having extensive access to sulfur from the Green River and charcoal from its forests, as well as being closely tied to the dwarves who once employed this technology, is in an extremely privileged spot for the production of this substance. We should take advantage of these circumstances, and develop ourselves into the foremost producers of gunpowder in our region* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>has terrain woods</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li><li>manpower is at least 4</li> | <li>country gets the modifier A99_early_gunpowder_production for 15 years</li><li>add manpower = -4</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>artillery = PREV</li><li>artillery = PREV</li><li>artillery = PREV</li><li>artillery = PREV</li></ul></ul> | [Dwarves under our Rule](#A99_dwarves_under_our_rule)<br />[Controlling the Logrodainé](#A99_controlling_the_logrodaine)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_resources_of_mount_havoral">Resources of Mount Havoral</a><br />*When Mount Havoral erupted during the Day of Ashen skies over 1000 years ago, it revealed many valuable deposits of ores and minerals in the mountains surrounding the volcano, such as the Sulfur that characterizes our Green River. If Varainé is to become ever more prosperous, it is vital that we secure these resources.* | <li>owns all provinces:</li><ul><li>area is cann_esmar_area</li></ul><li>cann esmar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>cann esmar area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 25</li></ul><li>high esmar area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 25</li></ul><li>bennonhill area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 25</li></ul><li>hearthswood area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>ryalanar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Small Problems](#A99_small_problems)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_securing_our_place_in_esmaria">Our Place in Esmaria</a><br />*From our humble origins, Varainé has managed to grow into a major power in Esmaria. Nearing complete domination over the region, it is important that all other nations in our path either learn to accept us as a dominant power or be ready to submit.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 25</li><li>region is esmaria_region</li></ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>region is esmaria_region</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>army size is this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A99_opinion_of_varaine_75</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier A99_our_nation_is_safe for 25 years</li> | [Resources of Mount Havoral](#A99_resources_of_mount_havoral)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_gunpowder_purification_process">Gunpowder Purification</a><br />*Though a respectable industry of powder-making has been established in Varainé, there is still much room for improvement. New methods of Saltpetre purification, as well as specialized milling and other techniques could help make our gunpowder ever finer and increase our production, solidifying Varainé as the best and largest producer of the substance in Cannor.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>fortification expert is at least 3</li><li>natural scientist is at least 3</li><li>trader is at least 3</li></ul><li>num of artillery is at least 30</li> | <li>country gets the modifier A99_high_quality_gunpowder for 20 years</li> | [Increasing Concentration](#A99_increasing_concentration)<br /> |

| <a name="A99_elven_communities">Elven Communities</a><br />*Ever since the end of the war of the Sorcerer King, when Varainé was first founded as a holding of the Párian nobility, the county has become home to a sizable population of Elves. While these elves were never discriminated against, not much effort has been done in the centuries since their establishment in our lands to actively integrate them into Varainéy society. It is in our interest to mend this error, and turn these disparate elven communities into active parts of our nation.* | <li>high tolerance elven race trigger is yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture is elven is yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier A99_elven_collaboration for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A99_controlling_the_logrodaine">Controlling the Logrodainé</a><br />*As the source of our Green River and a major tributary of the Esmar, the Logrodainé is a very important river for Varainé and its surrounding counties. Now that we fully control its margins, there is much we can do to help boost its utility to our nation* | <li>high esmar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>high esmar area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A99_controlled_river_flow</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>change innovativeness = 2</li> | [Secure our Borders](#A99_secure_our_borders)<br />[Elven Communities](#A99_elven_communities)<br />[The Green River](#A99_the_green_river_mission)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_soil_enrichment">Soil Enrichment</a><br />*While utilizing supplements to help improve the productivity of the soil is nothing new, we believe that by utilizing the sulfur from the Green River we'd be able to produce fertilizers that'd greatly increase the yield of our farms. The neighboring lands of Ashfield, renowned for their soil's productivity, would work as a wonderful testing ground for this new product.* | <li>ashfields area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>owned by is root</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>has building farm_estate</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has trade goods is grain, and has trade goods is livestock, and has trade goods is wine:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A99_soil_enrichment</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul> | [Controlling the Logrodainé](#A99_controlling_the_logrodaine)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_proper_glassware">Proper Glassware</a><br />*While Varainé has been playing around with alchemy for almost a millenia, if we are to truly turn this into a genuine science then we must have the appropriate tools for the job. Luckily, Varainé and other Esmari cities already have growing glass-making industries, and refining our glassware is a major part of advancing our craft into a proper scientific endeavor.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>owns 266</li></ul><li>266:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 20</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>271:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 20</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>309:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 20</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>271:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 24</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>309:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 24</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>production leader:</li><ul><li>trade goods is glass</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Rule Britannia"</li></ul><li>innovativeness is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has trade goods is glass:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>change innovativeness = 5</li> | [Soil Enrichment](#A99_soil_enrichment)<br />[Charcoal and Powder](#A99_charcoal_and_powder)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_increasing_concentration">Increasing Concentration</a><br />*As the productivity of our lands around the Green River soars, it becomes ever more important for us that the Green River remains a viable source of sulfur and other chemical compounds that we have come to rely on. To that end, our dwarven civil engineers have planned several projects that will help increase the concentration of the river, such as dams to reduce its flow and increased mining activities further upstream to increase seepage of chemicals in the water.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 175</li><li>area is high_esmar_area</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 150</li><li>area is high_esmar_area</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>309:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = A99_green_river_untainted</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A99_green_river_dilute</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Proper Glassware](#A99_proper_glassware)<br />[Resources of Mount Havoral](#A99_resources_of_mount_havoral)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_chemical_synthesis">Chemical Synthesis</a><br />*As Varainéy technology gets more advanced, we discover more and more usages for our chemicals: through the alternating usage of alkaline and acidic compounds, we're now able to greatly accelerate the bleaching process for textiles, generating higher quality clothing in smaller amounts of time, and utilizing special acids designed for metals, we're able to improve the finish on our metal weaponry, making them more resilient to damage (and nicer to look at).* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>has building weapons</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>has building textile</li></ul> | <li>If every owned province has trade goods is iron, and has trade goods is copper, and has trade goods is cloth, and has trade goods is silk, and has trade goods is dyes:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A99_chemical_processing</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul> | [Increasing Concentration](#A99_increasing_concentration)<br /> |

| <a name="A99_increasing_our_production">Increasing our Production</a><br />*While Varainé has in recent times been blessed with prosperity due to the increase of potions sold to the adventurers that are fighting in the Greentide, if we're to remain relevant in the future, we mustn't rest on our laurels and instead further develop our nation's production.* | <li>309:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>309:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A99_gearing_up</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul><li>change innovativeness = 2</li> |  |
| <a name="A99_the_green_river_mission">The Green River</a><br />*Our namesake and greatest pride, the Green River, is the heart of Varainé, and beyond being a stunning natural sight, it is also the starting point of our legacy of potionmaking and alchemy. The sulfur accumulated by the river from deposits in Mount Havoral, which is responsible for its distinctive green-yellow color, is extensively useful for many of our endeavors, and it is imperative that we learn how to best exploit this resource to advance our nation.* | <li>309:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>309:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A99_green_river_untainted</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Increasing our Production](#A99_increasing_our_production)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_recognized_gatherings">Recognized Gatherings</a><br />*Long before Varainé existed as a county, alchemists and herbalists had gathered around the margins of the Green River to share knowledge of alchemy and potioncrafting. Nowadays, with recent developments such as the Greentide and the increasing importance of chemicals, it has become clear to the Varainéy government the potential these congregations represent, and that properly recognizing and supporting these gatherings will surely help boost Varainé's prosperity.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Rule Britannia"</li></ul><li>innovativeness is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier A99_the_academy_recognized_gatherings until otherwise removed</li> | [Potion Seller...](#A99_potion_seller_i_want)<br /> |
| <a name="A99_bellicose_potionmaking">Bellicose Potion Making</a><br />*As adventurers showed during the Greentide, potions were an effective military tool when utilized properly. This experience, combined with inspiration of the extensive use of gnomish technology in this race's armed forces, opens the door to the possibility of increased utilization of potions in the Varainéy, either extensively or for specific elite units.* | <li>high tolerance gnomish race trigger is yes</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Rule Britannia"</li></ul><li>innovativeness is at least 15</li></ul><li>has professionalism equivalent:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 0.15</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Potions for the Army](../events/potions_for_the_army.md) happens</li> | [Recognized Gatherings](#A99_recognized_gatherings)<br />[Controlling the Logrodainé](#A99_controlling_the_logrodaine)<br /> |
