| <a name="irrliam_end_of_an_era">End of An Era</a><br />*Taelarios Irrliazuir is dead. The man who is the responsible for the rise of New Sun Cult and the founder of our nation is no more. While many are still shaken by this tragic loss,[Root.Monarch.GetName] has decreed that a time for a change has come. A time for Irrliam to take its rightful place as the leader of all Sun Elves and end the chaos which has been plaguing Bulwar for decades!* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has ruler "Taelarios I"</li></ul><li>does not have regency</li><li>stability is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier irrliam_newfound_zeal for 15 years</li><li>If sur mountains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="irrliam_control_south_coast">Control Southern Coast</a><br />*Sun Elves from Elizna have long lost the true cause, preying on instead of protecting humans and weakening Kheteratan people for gnolls to enslave. We should deal with them... but not now. Taking southern coast of Bulwar which they control and thus limiting their direct contact with other, more righteous elves would suffice.* | <li>679:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>682:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>680:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>568:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>572:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>num of galley is at least 15</li> | <li>If kuz mountains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If imuluses area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If birsartenslib area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>create admiral:</li><ul><li>tradition = 40</li></ul> | [End of An Era](#irrliam_end_of_an_era)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_control_north_coast">Control Northern Coast</a><br />*Birzartan≈°es has failed the Sun Elven people and the New Sun Cult faithful. They have warred against fellow Elves, allowing pesky goblins to invade and bring ruin to Bahar. They have failed to get rid of old sun cultists, allowing heretical ideas to spread in Bulwar. The people of northern Bulwar cry out for help and we shall answer this call and protect them from darkness like all Sun Elves must.* | <li>kuz mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>imuluses area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>birsartenslib area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>accepted culture is bahari</li> | <li>If bahar szel uak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If aqatbahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If fajabahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If azka evran area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Control Southern Coast](#irrliam_control_south_coast)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_troubled_north">The Troubled North</a><br />*The north has suffered much in recent years. The so-called goblin exodus devastated the region. With Baharkand failing to stop this invasion, some local humans have started thinking that Sun Elves are not fit to rule over them. These wrongful ideas should not be allowed to exist, the time has come for us to help these misguided people by placing them under our protection.* | <li>bahar szel uak area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>aqatbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>fajabahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Marble Head Clan</li><li>exists  is Greysheep Clan</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier irrliam_convert1 for 15 years</li><li>If has exists is U18:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = U18</li><li>type = cb_bulwari_subjugation</li><li>months = 360</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is U17:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = U17</li><li>type = cb_bulwari_subjugation</li><li>months = 360</li></ul></ul><li>If magairous area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If medbahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Control Northern Coast](#irrliam_control_north_coast)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_gates_of_cannor">Gates of Cannor</a><br />*With the conquest of Bahar complete we now control the entirety of Bulwari coast. Our merchants and traders look at the Divenhal sea, towards Cannor and the potential profit which may come from these lands. Trading with the empire would be beneficial for both of us, we should encourage our merchants to exchange goods with Anbennarians.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>U18:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>U17:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier more_merchants for 35 years</li> | [The Troubled North](#irrliam_troubled_north)<br /> |

| <a name="irrliam_drive_back_the_gnolls">Drive Back The Gnolls</a><br />*Gnollish slavers led by Tluukt have gathered up at the lands to the south of Irrliam. It is our duty as children of Surael to bring his holy light to these savages and free all the poor humans that have been enslaved there.* | <li>grixekyr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If jixobix area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If garpix tluukt area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>691:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [End of An Era](#irrliam_end_of_an_era)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_light_of_liberation">Light of Liberation</a><br />*The rich central cities of Bulwar have been raided by gnolls and without proper protection for quite some time. With our success against gnollish menace in the south we should bring the light of liberation to the humans of central Bulwar too. They may not appreciate it at first, but we will surely convince them living under our protection is better.* | <li>jixobix area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>garpix tluukt area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>691:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Golden Century"</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is irrliam_no_slaves_tt</li><li>688:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is slaves</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>religious unity is at least 1</li> | <li>If has exists is F30:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F30</li><li>type = cb_bulwari_subjugation</li><li>months = 360</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If kumarkand area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is F39:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F39</li><li>type = cb_bulwari_subjugation</li><li>months = 360</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>602:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is F36:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F36</li><li>type = cb_bulwari_subjugation</li><li>months = 360</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>612:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>607:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is F41:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F41</li><li>type = cb_bulwari_subjugation</li><li>months = 360</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>611:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>604:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier irrliam_benevolent_liberation for 20 years</li> | [Drive Back The Gnolls](#irrliam_drive_back_the_gnolls)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_ashes_of_the_phoenix">Ashes of the Phoenix</a><br />*Sareyand, the place where Jexis rose from is now a mere shadow of itself. This land is ruled by the weak dynasty which has failed to stop both the gnolls and the desert heretics. In honour of Jexis we should put them out of their misery and supervise Sareyand directly.* | <li>kumarkand area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>612:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>607:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>611:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>602:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>601:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>vassal is at least 4</li> | <li>If traz buranun area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south naza area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If sareyand area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Light of Liberation](#irrliam_light_of_liberation)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_phoenix_rising">Irrliamic Phoenix Rising</a><br />*Failed elven states defeated, humans brought back under control, gnolls and goblins pushed back. A new phoenix is on the rise... our phoenix. Irrliam proved to be upholding the true Sun Elven ways and established near total control over the region. With the help of our loyal subjects, zealous clergy and shrewd merchants we shall forge a new empire and make sure it is eternal.* | <li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is irrliam_phoenix_rising_tt</li><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Country is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>primary culture is sun_elf</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>add mil power = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier irrliam_phoenix_rising until otherwise removed</li><li>increase nsc isolation level = yes</li> | [Ashes of the Phoenix](#irrliam_ashes_of_the_phoenix)<br />[The Troubled North](#irrliam_troubled_north)<br /> |

| <a name="irrliam_vassal_loyalty">Reestablish Vassal Loyalty</a><br />*Lack of initiative coming from Irrliam and vast instability in the rest of Bulwar are among many causes for our vassal disloyalty. We should reinforce our position with them before it is too late.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>all subject country:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier irrliam_vassal_loyalty for 30 years</li><li>568:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>572:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="irrliam_land_route">Land Route to Brasan</a><br />*Our land connection to Brasan currently passes through marsh provinces, making it significantly harder to transfer goods between us and them. The better land route would be going through the lands currently owned by Elizna. Perhaps we could 'convince' them that these provinces would be better under our control?* | <li>568:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>572:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If outer drolas area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has exists is F32:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = F32</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 360</li></ul></ul> | [Reestablish Vassal Loyalty](#irrliam_vassal_loyalty)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_brasan">Bewitching Brasan</a><br />*Brasan is a city of an extreme importance to both humans and sun elves. Named after Brasan the Emancipator, a genie who has freed humans of Bulwar from the djinn. For us the city is important as the place where the treaty was signed, establishing both Irrliam as a state and the New Sun cult as a religion. As an act of good faith between our two races we should establish several development programs in the city. * | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>F24:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F24:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>owns core province 565</li><li>565:</li><ul><li>renaissance is at least 100</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>565:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base tax = 3</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = irrliam_brasan_development</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Land Route to Brasan](#irrliam_land_route)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_bulwar">Blossom of Bulwar</a><br />*Bulwar is definitely the most important city in this region, at least culturally. While they rejected out previous attempts at bringing them into the fold they finally understood their folly and have become our subject. Unfortunately, not all citizens of Bulwar think that. We should construct several administrative building there to better supervise our new vassal.* | <li>treasury is at least 175</li><li>F39:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F39:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul><li>owns core province 601</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -175</li><li>601:</li><ul><li>add base production = 4</li><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul> | [Bewitching Brasan](#irrliam_brasan)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_eastern_development">Eastern Development</a><br />*We have reached the eastern end of Bulwar Proper and the beautiful city of Harklum. The poor state was not treated well in the past and had several cases of gnollish raids and invasions. We will develop Harklum and prove to the locals that the bad days are over now that Irrliam is here.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>F36:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F36:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul></ul><li>harklum area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>harklum area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Blossom of Bulwar](#irrliam_bulwar)<br /> |

| <a name="irrliam_kalib">Goods of Kalib</a><br />*Kalib is a neighbouring state of Bulwar, whom the city often considers rival. Unfortunately, Bulwar has been far more successful than Kalib in terms of population and general prosperity. Despite that, Kalib still produces several goods very important to our merchants. We will invest into these goods production and help our subject even the odds with their rival.* | <li>treasury is at least 50</li><li>F44:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F44:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul><li>owns core province 599</li><li>599:</li><ul><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>owns core province  600</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -50</li><li>599:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li></ul><li>600:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="irrliam_zansap">Zealous Zan≈°ap</a><br />*Humans of Zan≈°ap have long been among our most favourite subjects. Loyal and extremely zealous, the Zan≈°api soldiers often form the bulwark of our human armies. We should make use of this extreme zeal by providing locals more and better opportunities to fight for Irrliam.* | <li>F43:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F43:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul><li>owns core province 596</li><li>owns core province  597</li><li>owns core province   598</li><li>596:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>597:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>598:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>596:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>597:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>598:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="irrliam_drolakand">Dockyards of Drolakand</a><br />*Drolas peninsula has long been wasted by Elizna. They have allowed a place with great potential to lay dormant without a use. Some of our advisors have been suggesting on constructing several dockyards and naval production workshops along the tip of the peninsula to better sponsor our growing navy.* | <li>treasury is at least 50</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type naval_reformer</li><li>advisor  is trader</li></ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F32:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul><li>owns core province 580</li><li>owns core province  582</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -50</li><li>580:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>change trade goods = naval_supplies</li></ul><li>582:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li><li>change trade goods = naval_supplies</li></ul> | [Land Route to Brasan](#irrliam_land_route)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_bahar">Restoring Glory of Bahar</a><br />*With our control spreading to the richest cities of Bahar the time has come to finally undo the decades of devastation. It will be costly but very beneficial to our new subject as it will show Bahari humans that Irrliam is here to save them and restore Bahar's old glory.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>U18:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>U17:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>If has reuyel area has type is all, and reuyel area has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul></ul><li>If has crathanor area has type is all, and crathanor area has country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Dockyards of Drolakand](#irrliam_drolakand)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_kumarkand">New Breadbasket</a><br />*Historically we never had a problem with food supply. Our people and our subjects have been well fed and we do not intend for any of them to hunger. But our recent expansions have started putting food supplies to the limit and we need a new place to provide food from. Our vassals from Kumarkand have suggested expanding their farm. With enough money and time spent we might turn Kumarkand into a new breadbasket of Bulwar. * | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>F30:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F30:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul><li>kumarkand area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>kumarkand area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul> | [Blossom of Bulwar](#irrliam_bulwar)<br /> |

| <a name="irrliam_anzabad">Promote Anzabadi Style</a><br />*Anzabad is important to Irrliam for several reasons - naval routes to Brasan, trade routes across Divenhal, location near our capital and more. But the city is also important for our human subjects as the place which makes beautiful clothing. We should promote Anzabadi style across all of Bulwar. * | <li>treasury is at least 75</li><li>F40:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>F40:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul><li>owns core province 559</li><li>owns core province  560</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Common Sense"</li></ul><li>has divert trade</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -75</li><li>559:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>560:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="irrliam_deals_with_merchants">Deals With Merchants</a><br />*Merchants and traders are among the most loyal and important supporters of the crown, but recently we haven't showed them much favour. Perhaps a few deals here, a couple of favours there would provide better cooperation between us and them?* | <li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 35</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 10</li> |  |
| <a name="irrliam_faith_and_coin">Faith and Coin</a><br />*If we are to be successful in uniting Bulwar under our control we must not just have large sways of land, we must have support of the people. There are two things that helped us strengthen Irrliam's stability before - the faith and the coin. Our zeal and devotion to Surael will inspire others, while our merchants would convince that true prosperity lies with Irrliam.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>temple is at least 15</li><li>cathedral is at least 10</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>marketplace is at least 15</li><li>trade depot is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier irrliam_trade for 20 years</li> | [Deals With Merchants](#irrliam_deals_with_merchants)<br /> |
| <a name="irrliam_establish_total_control">Establish Total Control</a><br />*Our efforts at spreading cultural influence across Bulwar have been successful. Irrliamic traders can be found in almost every town and our churches are full with devout subjects.
