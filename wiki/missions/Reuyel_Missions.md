| <a name="reuyel_osc_1">Faith in Flux</a><br />*As a part of the periphery of not only Bulwar but Bahar as well, the lands that we govern oftentimes finds themselves ignored by the inquisition of the new sun cult. frustrating to those fervent followers of Surael's teachings, but it has led to many smaller cults, preaching the old ways that are seen as heretical to those living in Bulwar proper. These cults flourish and, in certain cases, openly propagate in smaller societies. This, along with recent Jadd missionaries seeing Bahar as a starting ground, may finally bring the light of Surael to the land, forging a place for peaceful cooperation between the races, not just elves. Paradoxically, the aggressive tendencies of the new sun cult has created an environment with an air of tolerance for other interpretations of the one faith. We now face a questioning of whether or not our current religious policy is even the correct one; perhaps the light can be brought to victory through another path?* | <li>always</li> | <li>country gets the modifier U18_flux_faith for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="reuyel_osc_2">Reassure the Secret Societies</a><br />*In a meeting which never took place, in a temple that was long since destroyed, with a society that does not exist, a compromise was made, to ensure that this great lie would not be for naught. For the inquisition greatly exaggerated their accomplishments - they tend to do that - and they proclaimed the old cults dead. But we know better; the old way never died.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>statesman is at least 2</li><li>theologian is at least 2</li><li>philosopher is at least 2</li><li>diplomat is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>the event [Contact with the Cults](../events/contact_with_the_cults.md) happens</li> | [Faith in Flux](#reuyel_osc_1)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_osc_3">Temple of Temples</a><br />*Azka-szel-Azka ("Citadel of Citadels" in common), was for long the secret home for many practitioners of the old way. There in the tunnels dug by Bulwari from ages past, they made a home for themselves to keep their faith. As such it became a centre for worship and a grand temple among the secret sects, with more life than we had ever known. If we are to join their ways and follow Dartaxes in his rebellion, we should probably set up our temple of temples in the citadel of citadels to continue the rebellion.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>522:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier U18_azka_szel_azka_1</li><li>has province modifier  U18_azka_szel_azka_2</li><li>has province modifier   U18_azka_szel_azka_3</li><li>has province modifier    U18_azka_szel_azka_4</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Old Sun Cult Becomes Dominant](../events/old_sun_cult_becomes_dominant.md) happens</li> | [Reassure the Secret Societies](#reuyel_osc_2)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_osc_4">Provide Safe Haven</a><br />*Dartaxes, while a brave man, is under siege, his home open to attack from harpies to the east, elves to the south and north, and goblins to his north as well. His move feels like it was made more out of passion than a strategic mindset. And Dasmatuš, oh, Dasmatuš is too far away, off in the far Salahad, surrounded and subjugated by Gnolls and the endless sands. As such, if anyone is to have a real chance of bringing back the old ways to Bulwar, it is us. Only Re'uyel, situated on the edge of the influence of the inquisition with a glorious future ahead of us, can protect the followers of the old way. Let us open up our arms to any who wish to join us. For this rebellion, this return to the old, needs as many men as possible to keep it safe, praise Surakel.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>legitimacy equivalent is at least 90</li><li>army size is at least 25</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.8</li> | <li>521:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul><li>522:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul><li>523:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier U18_influx_old_believers for 10 years</li> | [Temple of Temples](#reuyel_osc_3)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_osc_5">United in Faith</a><br />*It is now clear to all of Bulwar that Re'uyel will join Dartaxes in bringing back the old ways, and convincing the people of Bahar of the value of these traditions. Let us bring all of Bahar into the true light, following the one true god uncorrupted by Taelarios' lie. So that Bahar may finally know harmony between man and elf, and replace the system of supposed elven divinity, with an equal society for man and elf. If the heathens in Cannor can do it, surely we should be able to as well?* | <li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>religious unity is at least 1</li> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add prestige = 25</li> | [Provide Safe Haven](#reuyel_osc_4)<br /> |

| <a name="reuyel_jadd_2">Invite the Desert Elves</a><br />*With our recent joining of the Jadd, we start something new in Bulwar, as the first of many nations who have found the truth in the Desert elves' teachings.\n\nCurrently, however, our new faith more than anything isolates us, as our heresy makes the nations of Bulwar, especially those of the sun elves, view us with suspicion and anger.\n\nAccordingly, a proper first move would be to bring in our new friends from the desert, to help guide us and bring this new light to the nation. A good home for these elves would be Yametšes, the large and sparsely populated island with sandy beaches would surely be a good home for those who lived in the desert for so long. Once settled, they can help guide our people in their ways, so that we ourselves can help bring the light to Bahar and remove the malevolent dark.* | <li>F46:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>the event [Desert Elves on the Sunset island](../events/desert_elves_on_the_sunset_island.md) happens</li> | [Faith in Flux](#reuyel_jadd_1)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_jadd_3">Sunset Temple</a><br />*Situated on the western shore of Yametšes lies a small cliff no more than ten meters above the sea level, with a perfect view over the sun as it sets on the western horizon. Already, many elves and humans take a stroll there to bask in the beauty of the location, and so a suggestion has come forth from those recent elven settlers. They wish to make the place a proper holy site. The idea proposes the creation of a small village with a port on the shore to host pilgrims from the mainland, and a beautiful temple on the cliff mixing elements of Bulwari and elven architectural styles, with a grand seating for any pilgrim to bask in the last rays of the sunset in the shining paradise of Yametšes.* | <li>581:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>religion is the_jadd</li></ul> | <li>the event [Sunset Temple](../events/sunset_temple.md) happens</li> | [Invite the Desert Elves](#reuyel_jadd_2)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_jadd_4">Expanding the Jadd</a><br />*Jaddari's teachings are ambitious - sometimes maybe a bit too ambitious - but his goals are what separates the Jadd from the elven-dominant sun cult and the old version: a grand tolerant state for all the world to enjoy. The Jadd teaches us that it is not the duty of some future saviour to bring the light, nor that Jaher was Surael reborn and that it is the elves who guard this light, but that we all have the ability and duty to combat against the dark. So as Jaddari brought the bewinged harpies into the light of Surael, we shall bring both the goblins and dwarves into the light, for the more we are, the stronger the light becomes.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>has owner religion</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>culture is exodus_goblin</li><li>has owner religion</li></ul> | <li>the event [Shared Expertise](../events/shared_expertise.md) happens</li> | [Sunset Temple](#reuyel_jadd_3)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_jadd_5">United In Faith</a><br />*With the recent conversion of the dwarves and goblins, our theologians now lock their eyes on grander projects, and many even propose that we spread the light all the way to our wayward brothers in the east, still following the old ways of elven supremacy. This we cannot allow, for all of Bahar needs to know the truth of the Jadd. We must finally bring harmony and unity in the fight against the malevolent dark.* | <li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>religious unity is at least 1</li> | <li>the event [United by the Jadd](../events/united_by_the_jadd.md) happens</li> | [Expanding the Jadd](#reuyel_jadd_4)<br /> |

| <a name="reuyel_nsc_2">Restore Faith in the Cult</a><br />*With the recent catastrophes occurring all over Bulwar, with the emergence of monsters from all over the perimeter of Bulwar - goblins from the Serpentreach, harpies from their hills in the north east, and gnolls from the Salahad - it seems as if there have come a shadow that blots the radiance of the sun. This has made many a man distrustful, suspicious, and angry at the cult, seeing them as the source to blame for this failure. As such, we need to restore faith in the cult through a mix of force and convincing words, to stabilize the country, silence dissidents, and restore faith.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>average unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul> | <li>the event [Return of the Chosen Ones](../events/return_of_the_chosen_ones.md) happens</li> | [Faith in Flux](#reuyel_nsc_1)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_nsc_3">West Bahari Elves</a><br />*As the spiritual descendants of Jaher, and thus the living incarnations of Surael, the Sun Elves are a crucial part of Bulwari society. But western Bahar has very few of these elves, something which our priests believe has historically invited heresy in Re'uyel.\n\nIn order to maintain the true faith and keep this stronghold of worship to the one living god in the frontier of Bulwar, we need to keep our hosts satisfied, and invite more to settle here.* | <li>development in provinces:</li><ul><li>value is at least 30</li><li>culture is sun_elf</li><li>region is bahar_region</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U18_return_of_chosen_ones until otherwise removed</li> | [Restore Faith in the Cult](#reuyel_nsc_2)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_nsc_4">Cleanse Our Homeland</a><br />*Monsters plague the hills near the Serpentreach - the so called Exodus Goblins came flooding out of the mountains like the pus out of a wound, a disgusting excrement that plague what used to be our homes, and a symbol of the malevolent dark trying to snuff out Surael's Light. Further, we find a more ancient threat, the Copper Dwarves, one of Jaher's first enemies as he landed upon these shores. They have for long been our enemy in these lands, and as heathens they cannot be trusted. Even if converted, the dwarven grudge is legendary - and should they betray their grudges, to lie is to aid the Dark. Both of these forces, these allies of the Malevolent Dark, whether willing or not, must be cleansed from Bulwar, and sent back up into the mountains from which they came.* | <li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 526</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>culture  is exodus_goblin</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>culture  is exodus_goblin</li></ul></ul><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>culture  is exodus_goblin</li></ul></ul><li>south overmarch area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>culture  is exodus_goblin</li></ul></ul><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>culture  is exodus_goblin</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [A pure Bahar](../events/a_pure_bahar.md) happens</li> | [West Bahari Elves](#reuyel_nsc_3)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_nsc_5">United In Faith</a><br />*All has been restored - all across Bahar we see the grandness of the restored order. The creatures tainted by and of the malevolent dark have been exiled out of Bulwar, and the land has been returned to the loving and caring hands of the humans and elves. And while the government may be run by humans, the best Maraš knows to ask their local elven priest for guidance, before making any move too great.* | <li>always</li> | <li>the event [United by the Sun Cult](../events/united_by_the_sun_cult.md) happens</li> | [Cleanse Our Homeland](#reuyel_nsc_4)<br /> |

But now, it is time to mend the old wounds; through the universal language of money. Investments in the hold of the copper dwarves will hopefully show them that in the long run, we mean no harm.* | <li>owns core province 526</li><li>526:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li> | <li>526:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul><li>521:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>largest increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = dwarven_race_tolerance_ai</li><li>value = 30</li></ul></ul> | [Dealing with the Dwarves](#reuyel_dwarves)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_dwarves_ironclads">Produce Ironclads</a><br />*The copper dwarves are unique amongst their brethren for their skill as sailors and naval officers. Through their stereotypical stubbornness and ingenuity, they have developed a uniquely dwarven way of fighting on the waves, and with it has come the innovation of the ironclad. A ship whose hull is made of metal instead of wood now floats on the Divenhal. We should look to adopt these new ideas and make these ironclads the core of our new, modern navy.* | <li>owns core province 526</li><li>526:</li><ul><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li> | <li>526:</li><ul><li>add unit construction:</li><ul><li>type = galley</li><li>amount = 10</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0.25</li></ul></ul> | [Invest in Ovdal Tûngr](#reuyel_dwarves_invest)<br /> |

| <a name="reuyel_crimson">Let the Crimson Flow</a><br />*Azkapas, or "Citadel Purple" is a very popular drink all over Bulwar, and even in some courts in Cannor. However, after the Decades of Devastation, the vineyards have been left to wither away, with few tending to them. If we wish to resupply the market and bring much needed coin to our coffers, we should start with restoring the vineyards - first in Azka-szel-Azka, and later the greater Medbahar Valley* | <li>522:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 6</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U18_crimson_wine for 10 years</li> | [Recover from the Devastation](#reuyel_recover_devastation)<br /> |

Its fertile and untouched lands are currently left only to sheep grazing; as such, let us expand the vineyards, and make the Medbahar Valley the wine capital of Bulwar.* | <li>522:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>520:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>520:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = wine</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = U18_terraced_vineyards</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>522:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = U18_terraced_vineyards</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Let the Crimson Flow](#reuyel_crimson)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_sun_elf_tech">Introduce Sun Elf Techniques</a><br />*In Tenkar, the elves, who are known perfectionists, have cultivated vineyards for centuries. There they have adopted a form of terraced vineyards, both elegant and highly effective in producing a large supply of beautiful grapes. Perhaps adopting the same system along the Medbahar Valley would bring us an even more bountiful harvest, providing Azkapas for everyone in the Divenhal!* | <li>owns core province 535</li><li>535:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>535:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = U18_terraced_vineyards_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>522:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = U18_terraced_vineyards</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = U18_terraced_vineyards_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>520:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = U18_terraced_vineyards</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = U18_terraced_vineyards_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Expand the Vineyards](#reuyel_vineyards)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_forges">Fire up the Forges</a><br />*Iron is not only a crucial metal for an army to function, but a rare metal in Bahar. Conveniently, Azka Barzil has a large supply of it, and several mines and forges can be found all across the province. Should we invest in restarting these forges after the Decades of Devastation, our army shall surely prosper.* | <li>owns core province 529</li><li>529:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier U18_forges_of_azka_barzil for 10 years</li><li>country gets the modifier U18_forges_of_azka_barzil_2 until otherwise removed</li> | [Introduce Sun Elf Techniques](#reuyel_sun_elf_tech)<br /> |

| <a name="reuyel_conquer_hold">Conquer the Hold</a><br />*The hold at Ovdal Tûngr has long held a firm grasp over Bahar. Before Jaher, they controlled the collected debts of all of Bahar, and as such effectively acted as the puppeteer of all trade and economic activity throughout the region. But when Jaher landed, and cleared the debts, he forced the dwarves to accept the new status quo.\n\nBut dwarven grudges are legendary, and we already see the plotting and scheming from their hold, best illustrated by their recent support of Crathánor and significant buildup of their fearsome navy. The only dominant power in Bahar should be a Bahari power, and as such, to start our control of the region, we must gain control over the Copper Hold.* | <li>owns core province 525</li><li>owns core province  526</li> | <li>country gets the modifier U18_hold_closed_trade_bonus for 20 years</li> | [Quantity has its Quality](#reuyel_quantity_fleet)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_dwarves">Dealing with the Dwarves</a><br />*Even before the conquest of Ovdal Tûngr, the dwarven question has rested heavily upon the minds of our top officers. Can we truly trust the dwarves to become loyal subjects, or should we perhaps force them into their hold and claim the surface for ourselves?\n\nWhile one side argues that believing the dwarves would forgive old grudges and become loyal subjects is a foolish endeavour, the others believe that if they would be treated as equals, and even had a say in our republic, then maybe, just maybe, they could see Re'uyel as their home.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>accepted culture is copper_dwarf</li><li>has country modifier racial_pop_dwarven_expulsion</li><li>has country modifier  racial_pop_dwarven_purge</li></ul> | <li>If has accepted culture is copper dwarf:</li><ul><li>525:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>526:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>largest increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = dwarven_race_tolerance_ai</li><li>value = 30</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>525:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Modabrana"</li><li>add base manpower = -3</li><li>add base production = -3</li><li>add base tax = -3</li></ul><li>526:</li><ul><li>change province name = "Arzdikeru"</li><li>add base manpower = -8</li><li>add base production = -8</li><li>add base tax = -8</li></ul><li>521:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 5</li><li>add base production = 5</li><li>add base tax = 5</li></ul><li>522:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 3</li><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add base tax = 3</li></ul></ul><li>If has owns core province is 527:</li><ul><li>527:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li><li>change province name = "Šad Uraš"</li></ul></ul> | [Conquer the Hold](#reuyel_conquer_hold)<br /> |
| <a name="reuyel_officers">Rotating the Officers</a><br />*We are finally on the precipice of our ultimate goal - to centralize political power under the republic, ending the rapacious rules of despotic governors and officers. The officers must learn to serve the people, first and foremost; and by doing so, they shall hone new skills in management and logistics for the benefit of the people. Good governance will be a reward in of itself - but shall also yield a fatter pocket, not to mention a stronger reputation for future political advancement.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 70</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_nobles_officer_corp</li><li>total development is at least 350</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add government reform = administrating_officers_reform</li> | [Re'uyel Reborn](#reuyel_rising_republic)<br /> |

Year after year, our crops withered away, broken under the sun - and when the rains finally came, it was far too late, and far too much in too short a time, drowning what few plants had survived the stifling dust and heat.\n\nThen came the glorious light of freedom - a glimpse of Surael's light itself - as we cast off the foreign despot, our officers rising to their duties and proclaiming a commonwealth for us all, without foreign interference.\n\nWar.\n\nThe already-starving farmers were devastated by the ensuing war; villages were burned, already emptied by starvation from drought and now afflicted with famine from war. A new silence fell upon not only Re'uyel, but all of Bahar, for all sides suffered greatly and were ravaged by the pangs of hunger. Despite our success in finally bringing stability to the land, Bahar is still withered away into a desert, not the bountiful garden it once was.\n\nThus, we must rebuild, forging past the lingering effects of the Decades of Devastation - but we should aim to do more than rebuild that which was lost. For every wooden bridge burned in war, we will rebuild one in stone. For every village depopulated, ten more shall be raised.

And most recently, the Crathánori secession bled us dry - and as we were at the verge of collapse, out of the darkness of the Serpentreach came a surprising saviour in the form of the goblin invasion.\n\nWith our enemies distracted, we must turn our attention to reforming our army and officer corps.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>army size percentage is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>If crathanor area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |

The idea is to create an army which excels due to the diversity of the races, rather than in spite of it.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Cradle of Civilization"</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.5</li></ul><li>army reformer is at least 3</li> | <li>country gets the modifier U18_combined_arms until otherwise removed</li> | [Expand Officer Corps](#reuyel_expanded_officers_jadd)<br /> |

But prior to his death, he was able to share some of his newfound knowledge with his disciples, who went on to build the Great Library in Aqatbar, which has survived millennia of catastrophes. While this might lead to a belief that the building is indestructible, it has still been ravaged by the recent chaos of the Goblin Exodus. All over the building, one can find signs of damage from battle; some texts have not been maintained properly and decayed; foundations are broken in certain places due to age; some structures have simply fallen into disrepair.

As the world changes around us and new things are invented all over Halcann - and even in far off Aelantir - we need to get with the times and expand the collection with both new and old documents from other libraries all across the world. We know that there is a great interest from other libraries as well, for we already have had some scholars from the Order of Chroniclers in Anbenncóst pester us about copies to take home.

First, the Kingdom of Birzartanšes, whose rivalry with our enemy Baharkand means they would surely help us if we seek to war upon the latter. Second, the border Kingdom of Ourdia suffered much under the goblins, and would surely be happy to have an ally against the goblins which took so much land from them - should we help them with their reclamation, they might even help us against the Crathánori.
