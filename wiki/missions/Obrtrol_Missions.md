How valley men came and stole what was ours.\n\nThey say what we do now will be a new story to carve in every cave. How the Jartal Agefa drove valley men into the sea to join the bones of the Jötunn. How Trolls took back what was stolen, what was theirs and always had been. Now Trolls will grind the valley men’s cities to dust and take their forts. The blood of the Jötunn watered this land once, now the blood of men will water it once again and make way for the Jartal Agefa!* | <li>fegras area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>kaldrland area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>region is dalr_region</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If olavslund area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If nyrford area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>998:</li><ul><li>change culture = fjord_troll</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add devastation = 20</li></ul><li>969:</li><ul><li>change culture = fjord_troll</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add devastation = 20</li></ul><li>963:</li><ul><li>change culture = fjord_troll</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add devastation = 20</li></ul><li>958:</li><ul><li>change culture = fjord_troll</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add devastation = 20</li></ul><li>medium decrease of human tolerance effect = yes</li> | [Crush the Puny Bear!](#obrtrol_finish_the_small_bear)<br /> |

| <a name="obrtrol_giants_home_reclaimed">Giants Home Reclaimed!</a><br />*It is well known that the far north was in ancient times home to the Giants, colossi from the earliest days of the world who towered over the other races in their dominion until disaster drove them into the northern seas. The Fjord Trolls of the north believe that they are the direct descendants of the giants and as such believe they have an ancestral right of sorts to the old holdings of the giant peoples and especially sites of giant ruins.\n\n"Whether this connection is true or not is rather up for interpretation as the exact origins of the troll people are shrouded in mystery to say the least. In any case much of Fjord Troll culture centres around this idea and many of their leaders have long dreamed of a restoration of the old Giant realms. No other site was more vital to that ambition than the Giants' Manse, arguably their most sacred place, the last city of the giants. Its capture by the Fjord Troll tribes legitimised both their belief in their right to Giant lands and their leaders who now were the undisputed master of the troll domains."\n\n-The Giantkin: An Exploration of the Far North, Chronicler Torwick Aeonflux, 1781* | <li>owns core province 985</li> | <li>add prestige = 30</li><li>If drowned giant isles area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "obrtrol_northen_reclamation" for 50 years</li> | [Take Olavslund](#obrtrol_take_olavslund)<br /> |

The Ice Giants ruled north mountain and valley, built many big cave.\n\nLeader tells of stories and legends Trolls have told for all times. How Great-Fathers left the north to us. To rule. How only Trolls strong enough. Leader tells of the humans weak, but too many. Trolls must come together, make war on many human.\n\nLeader speak of second war, stronger ones come from south, make war against the valley men. Leader say now the time to strike.

| <a name="obrtrol_organize_the_tribes">Organize the Tribes</a><br />*The early consolidation of the Fjord Troll tribes is a fascinating study in the development of trollish civilization. For centuries prior the Trolls of the far north had been organised into an extremely loose confederation of small tribes and individuals led by the strongest member of the race. Groups within this body would often feud and fight each other for power and resources and many Trolls were to be found on their own rather than in Tribal units.\n\n"This made centralizing any actual governmental power next to impossible for much of their history. However the early troll victory over Bjarnrík as well as the threat to the humans of the north started to foster, if not force, a more centralised and cooperative form of government amongst the tribes under the leadership of Svala and her son Barg. One that had never been seen before, and would have dread consequences for all Gerudia."\n\n-The Giantkin: An Exploration of the Far North, Chronicler Torwick Aeonflux, 1781* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>change government reform progress = 15</li><li>country gets the modifier "obrtrol_centralized_advice" for 25 years</li> | [Crush the Puny Bear!](#obrtrol_finish_the_small_bear)<br /> |
| <a name="obrtrol_restore_the_capital">Restore the Capital</a><br />*To call Murtrhol a capital city prior to the consolidations of the troll people by Svala is something of a misconception. Whilst it was certainly the seat of power for the Fjord Troll leaders it was less a city or even a town and more of a tribal gathering ground, a sacred meeting ground atop a giant ruin long since fallen into decay.\n\n"The early years of the new consolidated administration changed all that. A massive influx of trolls as well as captured human slave labour flooded into Murtrhol swelling the settlement's population by nearly three times in the space of a few short years. Whilst it still did not compare to the great cities of the south, this was no 'Northern Bulwar' as some of my more poetic colleagues would put it, it was certainly something of a change compared to the small collections of huts that stood on the same ground a short decade earlier.\n\n"The greatest legacy of this time was the beginning of permanent settlement of Murtrhol, with a series of crude but solidly built stone constructions cropping up, mostly constructed by slave labour. This would prove to be foreshadowing an even greater expansion of the settlement in years to come."\n\n-The Giantkin: An Exploration of the Far North, Chronicler Torwick Aeonflux, 1781* | <li>owns core province 995</li><li>995:</li><ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "obrtrol_mountain_runes_amplified" until otherwise removed</li><li>995:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li></ul> | [Organize the Tribes](#obrtrol_organize_the_tribes)<br />[Draell Labour](#obrtrol_draell_labour)<br /> |
| <a name="obrtrol_secure_our_past">Secure Our Past</a><br />*The old trolls tell many stories of Great-jötunn. Of great ice cities. Of shaping the mountains. Of ancient wars.

Giants long gone. Fortress crumbled into the earth. Halls are empty. Stones are cold. Snow buried the old thrones. The forges are silent. Few stones remain.\n\nWe have taken back great fortress.

| <a name="obrtrol_build_the_zein_market">Build the Zein Market</a><br />*The opening of Zeinazmark marked a historic day for the masses of the south, who at this point saw trollkin as mere barbarians destroying all they touched - a humorous idea coming from the mouths of men. Once, just a mere storehouse for the bones and the wondrous carvings of the trollkin, an enterprising troll, an interesting sort whose life must be given its own footnote, independently came up with the idea to peddle these excess riches. This task was difficult due to it being almost impossible to contact any traders - the few ships that still took to the northern trade routes were advised to avoid the shores of the giantkin - and the general disagreeableness of his simpler companions did not help the matter either.\n\n"The answer came one day to the troll when a few dwarven remnants - the old enemy and tricksters of the giants before - were discovered living near the shoreline, they were nearly executed when he had come in last second, his mind expressing a brilliance that would elude most of his brethren, and struck a deal with the meagre settlement: the dwarves were to live out their measly existence in peace if they were to be the trolls’ middlemen."\n\n -On the Shoulders of Giants: The History of Giantkin and Man, Baroness Ollyria Sursteinn, 1759* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>959:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 600</li><li>959:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -400</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -600</li></ul><li>959:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is ivory:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = ivory</li></ul><li>change province name = "Zeinazmark"</li><li>If has dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 2</li></ul><li>change culture = fjord_troll</li><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "obrtrol_bone_market"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Mammoths in Dalr](#obrtrol_mammoths_in_dalr)<br /> |

For all that the humans and dwarves accused the trolls of was truly the ugliness that they saw within themselves, projected onto a foreign foe. No, the troll has removed the yoke of old injustice from their backs and replaced it with a yoke of common purpose.\n\n"And with the rise of this new empire, so arises a new age of prosperity for the land of the giantkin. Not even during the Jötunnlagen of old was the land so justly ruled. And so, may the rule of the trolls begin. And so, may the Jattelagen begin."\n\n -On the Shoulders of Giants: The History of Giantkin and Man, Baroness Ollyria Sursteinn, 1759* |  | <li>set government rank = 3</li><li>add government reform = agdirvoeda_empire</li> | [The Wonders of the North](#obrtrol_the_wonders_of_the_north)<br />[Greatest Jötunn Palace](#obrtrol_greatest_palace_of_giants)<br />[Until The End Of Days](#obrtrol_until_the_end_of_days)<br /> |

From beyond the eastern gate and towards the Serpentspine we found something incredible: our brother-kin. They were as the fables described them: a race of wise, portly, and like-minded beings second only in strength to us.\n\nMeeting them for the first time felt surreal, but as time went by and our collective wariness melted away we began to interact with them as if they were long-lost siblings, sharing stories, partying, and clubbing each other over the heads just like true kin.* | <li>owns core province 4182</li> | <li>the event [The Mossmouth Plea](../events/the_mossmouth_plea.md) happens</li> | [The North Will Be Ours](#obrtrol_the_north_will_be_ours)<br /> |

What they did not expect was a detailed archive of each and every giant they killed, how they tasted, and which legendary ruler they were consumed by. The ogre delegation, in turn, must have expressed a great deal of surprise when the trolls started brutalizing them, cursing their state, their king, and swearing revenge upon their fallen masters.\n\nTo this day, it remains a grim day to my husband’s people, as it marks the beginning of the bloodiest conflict between brother races in history, known as the glorious Vestrig to the trolls... the profaned Magarikhlog to the Ogres.\n\n-On the Shoulders of Giants: The History of Giantkin and Man, Baroness Ollyria Sursteinn, 1759* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>far moitsa area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>yyl moitsa west area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has exists is I90:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = I90</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>If skurkha kyard area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If ogre mountains region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [The Last Road North](#obrtrol_the_last_road_north)<br /> |
