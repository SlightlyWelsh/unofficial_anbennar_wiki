| <a name="arakeprun_ruins_of_greatness">Ruins of Greatness</a><br />*Arakeprun is a mighty and grand city built upon the bones of Precursors. However, its grandeur falls short upon closer inspection: it is mostly a shanty town of ramshackle buildings built upon the foundations of better men. Arakeprun must be restored to its former glory, and most importantly a new temple to observe the mysteries of the Precursors and the magic of the Fey.* | <li>2007:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>increase legitimacy medium effect = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li> |  |
| <a name="arakeprun_splendor_of_spring_court">Splendor of the Spring Court</a><br />*The Spring Court resides by the Glorelthir and the Milsgelp sea, enjoying the fertility of its lands and the plentiful ruins providing Precursor relic. Arakeprun has long been the beating heart of the Selpheregi and the Spring Court, and with the restoration of the temple complex the redevelopment of the rest of the city can begin.* | <li>2007:</li><ul><li>development is at least 24</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "arakeprun_splendor_of_spring_court" for 15 years</li> | [Tools of the Ancestors](#arakeprun_tools_of_ancestors)<br /> |
| <a name="arakeprun_protector_of_selpheregi">Protector of the Selpheregi</a><br />*Surrounded by the Tuathak, Caamas, and the zealous Peitar, the Selpheregi endure warfare with those jealous of their prime lands.

| <a name="arakeprun_pretenders_of_pelomar">Pretenders of Pelomar</a><br />*Proudly proclaiming in their halls, the Pelomar believe that they are the voice of the Domandrod Fey. Their oath is hollow, their power meaningless, for they are but pretenders. Already the Protector of the Selpheregi, we should put Pelomar out of the misery of their false pretensions, and claim the title for ourselves!* | <li>owns core province 2049</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Pelomar</li></ul> | <li>If drisleak area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If sidmargbal area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [Demands of the Domandrod](../events/demands_of_the_domandrod.md) happens</li> | [Protector of the Selpheregi](#arakeprun_protector_of_selpheregi)<br /> |
| <a name="arakeprun_sidpar_wards_restored">Sidpar Wards Restored</a><br />*Over the years the Sidpar Wards have become neglected, loosening control over the trade with the Peitar and Fey of the Domandrod. With our backing by the Fey, let us rebuild and restrict this important trade to one power: ours.* | <li>owns core province 2041</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Sidpar</li></ul><li>2041:</li><ul><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If murdkather area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If serakriok area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If dearktir area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>2041:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul> | [Pretenders of Pelomar](#arakeprun_pretenders_of_pelomar)<br /> |
| <a name="arakeprun_conquest_of_the_summer_city">Conquer the Summer City</a><br />*The principal city of the Caamas and the Summer Court, Murdkather stands as a threat against our mission of unifying the seasons. Most importantly, it is an important trading port and shipbuilding center. It is time to prove that the Summer Court is inferior to the Spring!* | <li>owns core province 2037</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Murdkather</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>accepted culture is caamas</li><li>government rank is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>2037:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "arakeprun_elarbarc_shipyards"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Sidpar Wards Restored](#arakeprun_sidpar_wards_restored)<br /> |

| <a name="arakeprun_tools_of_ancestors">Tools of the Ancestors</a><br />*Throughout Eordand, countless Precursor ruins dot the landscape, containing valuable relics. The greatest of cities, Arakeprun, was rebuilt using tools from these ruins, but with the revolt of Elchos it has fallen into stagnation. We must correct this by establishing more ruin excavation operations in Varn and Letmener.* | <li>owns core province 2026</li><li>owns core province  2036</li><li>2026:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul><li>2036:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>2007:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = arakeprun_precursor_tool_deprivation</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [eordand_rebuilt_arakeprun](../flags/eordand_rebuilt_arakeprun.md)</li></ul> | [Ruins of Greatness](#arakeprun_ruins_of_greatness)<br />[Treachery of Elchos](#arakeprun_treachery_of_elchos)<br /> |

| <a name="arakeprun_treachery_of_elchos">Treachery of Elchos</a><br />*In the year 1435 Sonad Manaron Goldtree revolted away from Arakeprun, depriving us access to the rich Precursor ruins in their lands. Civil war split the realm, and the Dukad had won in the end by gaining help from the Pelomar pomps.

| <a name="arakeprun_seize_the_autumn_court">Seize the Autumn Court</a><br />*North of Arakeprun on the island of Einnsag the Autumn Court of the Tuathak convenes. Believing in the supremacy of the Autumn over all seasons, they spit in our belief of the Spring. Einnsag is only a short distance from Arakeprun, although it is protected by the waves and the Autumnal navy. Let us end their hold over the waves by proving our superiority, and seize the Autumn Court for ourselves!* | <li>2159:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Einnsag</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "arakeprun_seizure_of_einnsag" for 15 years</li><li>If iadth area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If sglolad area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If raithlos area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Tools of the Ancestors](#arakeprun_tools_of_ancestors)<br /> |
| <a name="arakeprun_foghar_under_arrag">Foghar under Arrag</a><br />*With the seizure of Einnsag, the traditional seat of the Autumn Court is ours. However, the vast majority of the Tuathak lands are still held by the many Dukads and Scarbags. They must be made subservient to our Court on Einnsag.* | <li>iadth area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>sglolad area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>raithlos area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>accepted culture is tuathak</li><li>government rank is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>If tamharcroc area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If fogharbac area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "arakeprun_tuathak_drills" for 15 years</li> | [Seize the Autumn Court](#arakeprun_seize_the_autumn_court)<br /> |
| <a name="arakeprun_borders_of_winter">Borders of Winter</a><br />*The city of Darblath marks the traditional northern border of the Tuathak lands, and serves as a bulwark against the Snecboth forces of Winter. Unfortunately, their hold over the season is weak at best, and they have been unable to continue the Warmth rites. Subjects of us by right, we must make them bow and continue these rituals, by our demand!* | <li>owns core province 1969</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Eighard</li></ul><li>1969:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>base manpower is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "arakeprun_warmth_of_the_last_days" for 15 years</li><li>jhorgashirr area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>gemradcurt area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>medhan area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Foghar under Arrag](#arakeprun_foghar_under_arrag)<br /> |
| <a name="arakeprun_quell_the_blizzard">Quell the Blizzard</a><br />*In the far north of Eordand the Snecboth dwell in cold and miserable lands. And against all logic, they revere the Winter, and cast magic to further the grasp of it on their land and ours. It is time to end their uncontrolled cryomancy, and thaw the land with the warmth of the Spring!* | <li>owns core province 1775</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Gemradcurt</li></ul><li>1775:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>gemradcurt area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "arakeprun_thawing_of_glaciers"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Borders of Winter](#arakeprun_borders_of_winter)<br /> |

Having migrated from their ancestral lands, the Jhorgashirran have battled with the Snecboth for generations. They have denied our call for vassalage under the rightful Autumn Court, we must teach them not to deny us!* | <li>owns core province 1965</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Jhorgashirr</li></ul><li>land forcelimit is at least 30</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "arakeprun_randrunnse_trade" for 15 years</li><li>galbhan area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>trimgarb area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Quell the Blizzard](#arakeprun_quell_the_blizzard)<br /> |

| <a name="arakeprun_prepare_for_southern_eordan_expedition">A Southern Expedition</a><br />*To the south of Eordand lies an arid peninsula inhabited by the Fograc, a people who long ago rejected the Eordellon faith.

| <a name="arakeprun_dawnfires_gambit">Dawnfire's Gambit</a><br />*The lands of the Spring Court have always been fruitful in more than just crops. Countless Precursor ruins dot the landscape, even making up the foundation of Arakeprun city. Surpassing traces of magic, Filnar Dawnfire has detected a source to the south in the rebellious state of Elchos. However, none of the rest of the magisters have been able to confirm this, seeming a fool's quest to some.

Arakeprun is the center of Darhan, a magnificent city, but without its surroundings of Tanan and Virb it would not be possible.

Because of the efforts made into developing the region, the production of these fabrics has expanded, along with the demand. Our government must promote these industries and reprioritize Arakeprun as a center for cloth production rather than the obsolete incense trade.* | <li>2004:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2025:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2004:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "arakeprun_textiles"</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>2025:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "arakeprun_textiles"</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>2007:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "arakeprun_textiles"</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul><li>2007:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = cloth</li></ul> | [Blossoming of Darhan](#arakeprun_darhan_blossoming)<br /> |
