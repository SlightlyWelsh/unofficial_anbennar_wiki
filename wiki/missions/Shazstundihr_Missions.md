| <a name="shaz_harvesting_finest_marble">Harvesting The Finest Marble</a><br />*We, the working and sweating dwarves of the mountains of Serpentreach pride ourselves in our grit and hardiness. While we may be short and rigid, we are tough and resilient. Hence, we dutifully work hard for our pay, be it from trade or from barter. As such, we have been granted an opportunity from our ancestors a grand trade for a simple stone. The low-lying peoples of Bulwar seek our marble, as their grand palaces and structures require the resources of many lands - which includes ours. These elves, humans, whoever may it be, are very resourceful people. They understand the true gift of our hold, hence we must honor their wishes through the promise of marble.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>region is serpentreach_region</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 4</li><li>province group is hold_province</li></ul> | <li>serpentreach region:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If every owned province has region is serpentreach region, and has terrain is dwarven hold, and has terrain is dwarven hold surface:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Outside Of Our Walls](#shaz_outside_our_walls)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_sell_said_marble">To Sell Said Marble</a><br />*Marble is an irresistible stone for many purposes. For any sculptors, a good piece of marble can lead to a spectacular piece of work like Alexandros síl Anbenncost’s ‘Dame de Milo’. For any aspiring architects, a supply of marble can lead to Balgar’s White Walls of Castanor. Fortunately for us, we are the marble hold, known to have the best marble, white as a cloud. Ever since the collapse of our ancient ancestors long ago, there has been a rising demand for marble to which the small mines around the world cannot supply. Their marble is lumpy, found with holes and discrepancies that don’t allow for proficient use of the stone.\n\nNow though? We have returned to provide. To make sure our trade networks are secure and that we can efficiently provide the demand for the stone, we must make sure that Shazstundihr can safely store the marble gained from the serpentreach and deep in its caves, and that it can also ship it out with ease. This may require a bit of expansion to the hold, but it’s nothing we can’t handle. The reward will be far greater than the expenses.* | <li>2942:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>2942:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = shaz_symbol_wealth</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "shaz_marble_trade" for 20 years</li> | [Harvesting The Finest Marble](#shaz_harvesting_finest_marble)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_the_food_basket">The Food Basket</a><br />*With expansion always comes the problem of logistics. We have set our sights on bringing our prosperity to the rest of Bulwar, and for that we need to have the infrastructure to handle a larger population and and army. Ensuring we can provide food for the hungry will require significant investment from the council, because while this isn't the flashy side of expansion, it is needed.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is fur</li><li>trade goods  is grain</li><li>trade goods   is wine</li><li>trade goods    is serpentbloom</li><li>trade goods     is fungi</li><li>trade goods      is fish</li><li>trade goods       is livestock</li></ul><li>development is at least 15</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction any</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has building temple</li></ul></ul> | <li>If random owned province has trade goods is fur, and has trade goods is grain, and has trade goods is wine, and has trade goods is serpentbloom, and has trade goods is fungi, and has trade goods is fish, and has trade goods is livestock; and  has development is 15, and  has production building trigger is yes, and does not have construction is any; and does not have building is temple:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = temple</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is fur, and has trade goods is grain, and has trade goods is wine, and has trade goods is serpentbloom, and has trade goods is fungi, and has trade goods is fish, and has trade goods is livestock; and  has development is 15, and  has production building trigger is yes, and does not have construction is any; and does not have building is temple:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = temple</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is fur, and has trade goods is grain, and has trade goods is wine, and has trade goods is serpentbloom, and has trade goods is fungi, and has trade goods is fish, and has trade goods is livestock; and  has development is 15, and  has production building trigger is yes, and does not have construction is any; and does not have building is temple:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = temple</li><li>speed = 0.5</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> | [To Sell Said Marble](#shaz_sell_said_marble)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_the_marble_road">The Marble Road</a><br />*The Marble Road can only lead us so far. Trade across land is dangerous. After all, we did just expel hundreds of angry goblins from our lands. News of marble robbers have spread across the land, and the resources required to fund the caravans and their journeys has skyrocketed. It is still an option to continue forward with the road, but some of those in the White Stone Council have offered another idea.\n\n’Why not build a navy? Ask some elves and humans to sail across the sea. We can pay them.’\n\nThe prices for building a navy and paying these human and elven traders to set off and sell marble for us without dwarven guidance would be risky, but overall, if we do it well, it comes out as a net gain. The Marble Road can extend to the sea, and the trade would be ludicrous. All that is required now is the execution.* | <li>521:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is Shazstundihr</li><li>share is at least 45</li></ul></ul><li>num of light ship is at least 10</li> | <li>the event [A Proclamation](../events/a_proclamation.md) happens</li> | [The Food Basket](#shaz_the_food_basket)<br />[The Marble Trade](#shaz_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_greatest_little_port">The Greatest Little Port</a><br />*Brasan was an important port, for everything going in and out of Bulwar. There was no point in denying its key strategic value to all forms of trade, including its importance for the Marble Trade. Our ports of Aqatbar and Re’uyel simply cannot compete with the amount of outflowing trade coming from Brasan, even with our work and investments! If we are to secure the marble trade for good, and to assure a stable influx of cash instead of a highly unstable economy, Brasan must be secured.\n\nBrasan, after all, has been under subjugation by many kingdoms now, and has never been able to fully flourish due to mismanagement. Under our control, we suspect a massive increase in trade and importance for the city. Under our guidance, Brasan could become almost equal to the cities of Anbennar like Anbenncost! There are no downsides, at least nothing foreseeable. There are only investments, and they seem like they will return very shortly.* | <li>upper brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>lower brasan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>565:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 65</li></ul></ul> | <li>565:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "shaz_greatest_little_port"</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul></ul> | [The Marble Road](#shaz_the_marble_road)<br />[In Need Of Assistance?](#shaz_in_need_of_assistance)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_new_world_port">New World Port</a><br />*Brasan has become the center of trade in the Divenhal, even outcompeting cities like Anbenncost and Damescrown, who have ruled the trade across Cannor, into Bahar, and across the north shores of Salahad. Brasan now sits atop a golden throne of riches and power, dictating the flow of trade. \n\nTo make sure that Brasan can keep up with these changes, finance is required to be put into the city. Its infrastructure, while not poor, is still lacking for the struggles and maintenance that lay ahead. Brasan’s port must be larger than the rest of the other ports near our shores combined, and its markets must expand so that they can be seen for miles. This will grant us the power we need for Brasan to sit upon a throne of power and wealth, and to become the New World Port.* | <li>565:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>the event [Brasan's Marble Building](../events/brasan_s_marble_building.md) happens</li> | [The Greatest Little Port](#shaz_greatest_little_port)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_legacy_of_marble">The Legacy Of Marble</a><br />*The process of making marble from a beautiful piece of natural rock to a beautiful piece of artwork to line the halls of courts and palaces across the world is long and hard. Starting from the quarries in the Marble Galleries, Shazstundihr, and across lesser quarries in and around the Serpentreach and Bulwar, the stone is harvested in big chunks, cut down to size, and brought down hundreds of miles from mountains to cities. In these cities, the marble is sold in various different forms: from slabs to small cuts and even full sized chunks for those who use it for large construction. Across the world, the marble harvested from any other mines pales in comparison to the ones harvested in the areas around Shazstundihr. Purely white marble, easy to carve, and easy to mine and deliver. Desired by many, controlled by us. We control the marble trade, a true monopoly on an expensive good.\n\nShazstundihri marble can be found everywhere now, for cheap and for plenty. When one now visits a town in the Harpy Hills, or Brasan and Bulwar even, they will not see the weak and ugly stone of before, they will see the strong marble lining the city with art carved into it with care.\n\nThe legacy of marble has become legendary. One may even say it has become more desired than diamonds, mithril, and damestear. The greatest of sculptures and most astounding buildings seem to all now be credited to Shazstundihri marble. We shouldn’t just sell our marble, but celebrate it for what good fortune it has brought us.* | <li>565:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is Shazstundihr</li><li>share is at least 65</li></ul></ul><li>521:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is Shazstundihr</li><li>share is at least 65</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 3</li><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul></ul><li>trade income percentage is at least 0.35</li> | <li>the event [The Divenhal Sees Marble](../events/the_divenhal_sees_marble.md) happens</li> | [New World Port](#shaz_new_world_port)<br />[Redesigning Bal Ourd](#shaz_redesign_bal_ourd)<br /> |

| <a name="shaz_shazstundification">Shazstundification</a><br />*Patrolling these ancient halls, a dwarf is struck by the profound melancholy for all that was lost over millenia of dwarven stagnation and greenskin rampage. But one is also filled with pride - for all the wear of time and malice of orcs in a dozen lifetimes has not been able to sweep away the grandeur of Shazstundihr! We are the children of our Ancestors, and we can see in every stone the ancient glories and shining future of this hold.

| <a name="shaz_outside_our_walls">Outside Of Our Walls</a><br />*What have goblins ever done for us? If we, the working, sweating Dwarven men of Shazstundihr promise peace, bread, and trade with all who gaze upon our gates, why is it that these wretched dirthobbit scoundrel ravage and barbarize our work? It was once said that only a being with the capability to think can differentiate a stone from a gem. If true, then the goblins only think of our marvelous work as nothing short of a trove of loot, for them alone and for no one else's. This grave insult to our ancestors, to our very own livelihood, This cannot go on for long. It must be understood that our task is to eliminate the threat of the goblin scum from our great hold, once and for all.* | <li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If reuyel area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If crathanor area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = shaz_holding_walls</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul><li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = shaz_holding_walls</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul> | [A Guide Into The Light](#shaz_a_guide_into_light)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_great_goblin_banishment">The Great Goblin Banishment</a><br />*Shazstundihr has solidified its position in Bulwar by cleaning out what remains of the Goblin scourge. The clans that once ravaged the lands now either lay in their huts hidden away or have been killed. Unfortunately for us, these goblins cannot be trusted. They scheme, and surely will rise up against us eventually. To avoid the likely consequence of a goblin rebellion due to our obliviosity, it is best to remove our long-time enemies from our lands, whether they like it or not. While this may be cruel, it must be done. Integration would be impossible, our history makes it so. There is no coming to an understanding for us.\n\nThe only option now left is to purge the scourge from Bahar, as an act of cruel mercy.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is marble_goblin_conquest_tt</li><li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li></ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier racial_pop_goblin_purge</li><li>has country modifier  racial_pop_goblin_expulsion</li></ul> | <li>the event [Leftover Treasures](../events/leftover_treasures.md) happens</li> | [Outside Of Our Walls](#shaz_outside_our_walls)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_reconstruction_ryuyel">The Reconstruction of Re'uyel</a><br />*The city of Re'uyel is a touchy subject to deal with. A republic of officers they fought for freedom against oppression, but often simply replaced it with their own. Like all other great cities it shall be built back greater than ever before, but we must decide what it shall be like. It's position as a great port could be built upon to become a hub of all of Bulwar, it's schools and reputation as a melting pot can be leveraged for a great center of learning, or its military history can be drawn upon for a great officer school. This great city shall again rise in white marble, and shall forever be a beacon of freedom in Bulwar.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>521:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>is prosperous</li><li>province trade power is at least 15</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>521:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li><li>province trade power is at least 15</li></ul><li>num of light ship is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Re'uyel's Marble Building](../events/re_uyel_s_marble_building.md) happens</li> | [To Sell Said Marble](#shaz_sell_said_marble)<br />[The Great Goblin Banishment](#shaz_great_goblin_banishment)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_furthest_reaches">The Furthest Reaches</a><br />*Rebuilding Re’uyel as a capital for the far west of Bahar has given us a plausible claim for the surrounding regions, and as such we should consolidate our western borders. If we achieve that, the future of this land looks bright: the Crathanori merchants will trade under our flag while maintaining their beliefs, and the local elves will have their temples and houses built of a stone they have long admired. This is not one great project, but it requires as much commitment – for as part of Shazstundihr, these peoples will enjoy prosperity as they haven’t seen since the decades of devastation left their lands plundered.* | <li>reuyel area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>crathanor area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>521:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>516:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>medium increase of elven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>medium increase of human tolerance effect = yes</li> | [The Reconstruction of Re'uyel](#shaz_reconstruction_ryuyel)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_trade">The Marble Trade</a><br />*While the demand for marble was not particularly high in the past, the reintroduction of this stone in high quantities to the Cannorian and Bulwari elites has increased their interest on our goods. This newfound economic growth has presented its limitations however, as our cities and ports simply cannot handle the amount of marble they need to export. One thing is certain – for now, we have to invest in infrastructure, before reaping the benefits of a trade hegemony on marble.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>area is crathanor_area</li><li>area  is reuyel_area</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>region is bahar_region</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 2</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = treasurer</li><li>name = "Thargor Megyir"</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>culture = marble_dwarf</li><li>religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [The Furthest Reaches](#shaz_furthest_reaches)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_in_need_of_assistance">In Need Of Assistance?</a><br />*Our territory has expanded greatly beyond our hold, and with that comes responsibility for the welfare of its inhabitants. The people of Bulwar have been bathed in violence and neglect for nigh on decades now, and many of those who did not perish have lost their livelihoods and homes. They cry out to us for assistance, and if we are to establish an everlasting edifice in Bulwar then we must answer them and build up their towns and cities.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 30</li><li>development is at least 10</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has terrain dwarven_hold</li><li>has terrain  dwarven_hold_surface</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Assistance Recieved!](../events/assistance_recieved.md) happens</li> | [The Marble Trade](#shaz_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_redesign_bal_ourd">Redesigning Bal Ourd</a><br />*Bal Ourd is the southernmost Castanorian fort that still stands. It is placed in the crossroads between Cannor and Bulwar, and thus is a decisive point for us to hold if we are to defend from any interested Cannorians.\n\nThat is not the only reason for our interest in this fort, for at closer inspection, we see the clear inspiration from our ancestors' architecture. The fort is white and constructed of marble, with clear resemblance to early Shazstundihri architecture. It was also recently discovered through excavation around the area, that the designer of the fort was fond of our ancestors' architecture, and had visited Shazstundihr many times before when our gates remained open. \n\nIt is our job to bring the fort’s full potential out, and to make it shine once more. If we don’t, how can we call ourselves the best builders around? Let us begin the redesigning!* | <li>510:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>south overmarch area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [Strak Brok](../events/strak_brok.md) happens</li> | [The Greatest Little Port](#shaz_greatest_little_port)<br />[The Faux City Of Bulwar](#shaz_faux_city_bulwar)<br /> |

| <a name="shaz_preparation_for_expedition">Expedition Preparations</a><br />*Shazstundihr sits at the southern heights of the Serpentreach, having served as a point of entrance to Bulwar until its fall. As such, it was used by the goblins as a passage into the outside world. If we are to protect our new home from future invasions, we must reach Bulwar – and rid it of such squatters.\n\nWhile we are used to preparing and carrying out expeditions into hostile lands, this one will require much more effort from our part; We must seek to befriend whatever men live there, and we ought to be ready for their response.* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>army size percentage is at least 0.9</li> | <li>custom tooltip = shaz_prep_exped_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="shaz_a_guide_into_light">A Guide Into The Light</a><br />*We are still a long way to restoring the splendor Shazstundihr had before its fall. That did not stop, however, the first foreign delegation to cross the Marble Gate in centuries from gazing in awe at our ongoing works. Halls, tunnels and bridges all clad in white, pink and black tones of our namesake stone, all seemed to greatly relieve the guests as they entered.\n\n“We came to these halls dreading darkness”, one of the diplomats remarked, “it was not our expectation to find a place so fresh and enlightened”. So it happens that part of this hold is within the sunlight’s grasp due to marble’s reflective nature – allowing the creation of a small diplomatic facility for our light-accustomed friends.\n\nA new diplomatic facility will solidify our alliance, in addition to securing guidance for further expeditions into the lands bathed by the Sun.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier monstrous_nation</li></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>religion is goblinic_shamanism</li></ul></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>Country is Ovdal Tungr</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 130</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has F23 has alliance with is ROOT:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>the event [Marble And Copper, Making It Work](../events/marble_and_copper_making_it_work.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>If random ally does not have country modifier is monstrous nation; and does not have tag is F23; and  has capital scope has superregion is bulwar superregion; and  has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 100:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = 15</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier shaz_diplo_guide for 15 years</li> | [Shazstundification](#shaz_shazstundification)<br />[Expedition Preparations](#shaz_preparation_for_expedition)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_reforging_the_council">Reforging The Council</a><br />*As we continue to expand and develop, it’s becoming apparent our current methods of governance won’t suffice. Already our departments are reaching their very limits while bloat prevents the truly talented from rising above the filth that has begun to fester. If we don’t want to collapse on our own weight, then reform is a necessity. But, where to start? Thanks to our scholars, we have an idea.\n\nWhile most records of old Shazstundihr have long been destroyed, we were able to recover a small few which gave us insight on how the hold operated. One institution that came up multiple times is the ‘White Stone Council’, a chamber of government that only allowed the most skilled citizens within the hold’s domain to participate within it, where they advised the monarch in all things that fell under their field of expertise. Not long after this revelation, there has been a vast amount of support from our officials for restoring the Council, and the ruler has little reason to disagree.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li><li>2942:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 4 yes</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is ADM</li><li>culture is marble_dwarf</li></ul> | <li>add government reform = shaz_white_stone_council</li> | [A Guide Into The Light](#shaz_a_guide_into_light)<br /> |

And under the sun, the petty squabbling of the sun elves over a lost legacy offers a poor foundation to build peace in Bulwar from. It is our duty to lay the stones that surround us and restore peace to these lands. However, we admit we are still out of place above ground, and must seek out allies to assist us in our defense. We refuse to be cast out so that elves, goblins, or anyone else can continue their fruitless games at the expense of countless lives. If attacked, we will defend the future we see!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul></ul></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>religion is bulwari_sun_cult</li></ul><li>all ally:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 130</li></ul></ul></ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 0</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>every ally:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>amount = 15</li></ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>value = 20</li></ul><li>add historical friend = ROOT</li></ul> | [Reforging The Council](#shaz_reforging_the_council)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_integrating_elves">Integrating The Elves</a><br />*Relations between the Dwarves and Elves have long been fraught, dating back millennia to a primordial conflict between our Ancestors and the Precursors of the Elves. Modern interactions have also tended toward hostility, with the new elven Sun Cult proclaiming the elves as the divine chosens of Surael, holding dominion and stewardship over the whole of Bulwar.\n\nBut the Elves of Bulwar today are not the lords of the Phoenix Empire of centuries past, and this New Sun Cult is scarcely a generation old to most Elves. Both our peoples have been humbled by internal strife and the ravages of time. It is as strangers to this land that we come to Bulwar, and it is time to put the old enmities to rest.

Over the years, the city has developed a unique taste of Bahari culture, where pillars scrape the skies and buildings are round and dominated by carved domes with depictions of great kings and queens. Some are made of tile and some are made of gilded gold acquired through hardships. The architecture is very unique, to say the least. There is a need though, a need for assistance and renovation still. Much of the cities resources have been used on the conflicts of the Sun Cults.

The main town of course is also very unique, with small buildings built with hard brick walls and tile roofs. The city itself is well protected, but being so high in the mountains, there are bound to be issues. Supplies are scarce, for what wealth the city has is often rationed amongst many different things.

Its recent history, though, has been marred by being subjugated by the gnolls as a small city state with no influence over the politics of the rest of the lands. Many elves could probably still recount their fathers tales of when Bulwar had importance to the land sharing its name. Now though, the city has no real power, no real meaning, even if it is the biggest city in the region.

They uphold their beliefs of power to the highest degree, and while they may say it is simply a practice of religion, one cannot lie that the power that comes alongside these practices must be lustfully intoxicating. They sit in their luxurious villas, where they dictate how society should be run from their comfortable abodes. The humans of the country are barred from any governmental positions, and are often forced into labor in farms run by wealthy oligarchs. There is barely any opportunity for the majority of the land, for they live under the boot of an oppressive, impossibly pious group of aristocrats.\n\nThese ideas of religious superiority will fester, and if left unchecked, could become the direct opposition to our ideas and what we have fought for. The hunger for greed and power in these elves must be abolished, whether by our hand or the next!* | <li>sareyand area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.3</li><li>army size is at least 60</li> | <li>the event [The Aristrocrats](../events/the_aristrocrats.md) happens</li> | [The Faux City Of Bulwar](#shaz_faux_city_bulwar)<br />[Masters In Varamhar](#shaz_masters_in_varamhar)<br /> |

The capital must again become a load-bearing pillar upon which the rest of the region can find stability. Moreover, putting in the effort to rebuild the city will silence naysayers who distrust our intentions, and will be an opportunity to show the strength and power of Shazstundihr - in war, and in peace.* | <li>549:</li><ul><li>base tax is at least 12</li><li>devastation is at least 0</li><li>has state edict edict_centralization_effort</li></ul> | <li>the event [Birsartansbar's Marble Building](../events/birsartansbar_s_marble_building.md) happens</li> | [Shazstundihri Bases](#shaz_shazstundhiri_bases)<br />[Memory Of Birzartanšes](#shaz_memory_bizartanses)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_the_harpy_raiders">The Harpy Raiders</a><br />*Our gaze now turns eastward towards the Harpy Hills. Its avian raiders have long terrorized the people of these lands, stretching back to the Bulwari Age of Monsters. When we emerged from the mountains, we found that us Dwarves were no exception. Our bordering lands have frequently been attacked by Harpy raiders, kidnapping our new citizens and raiding their newfound wealth that stems from our hold.

Therefore, in order to be rid of their attacks and safeguard our cause, we were forced to directly attack the Harpies. Our kidnapped citizens and stolen goods were returned. Unlike the Marblehead Goblins, the Harpies had shown great care to preserve the objects of their Hunt, such as a statuette of Argor Whitebeard himself among other marble artifacts. After debating the issue, we decided that we would speak with Harpy leaders and determine if they could be won over to our cause.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>culture is firanyan_harpy</li></ul><li>660:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [Split Harpies](../events/split_harpies.md) happens</li> | [The Harpy Raiders](#shaz_the_harpy_raiders)<br /> |

Their roosts now stand repaired, with white marble columns, balconies, and arches supporting existing architecture. Below, a newfound market has formed, and with the earth and sky united the Harpies now stand alongside Dwarves, Elves, and Humans in the resplendent marble domain of Shazstundihr.* | <li>harpylen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>660:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 2</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Harpylen's Marble Building](../events/harpylen_s_marble_building.md) happens</li><li>large increase of harpy tolerance effect = yes</li> | [White Infrastructure](#shaz_white_infrastructure)<br />[Ending The Harpy Vandals](#shaz_ending_harpy_vandals)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_masters_in_varamhar">Masters In Varamhar</a><br />*The wise men of Varamhar have proven to be time and time again a stronghold for the beliefs of Bulwar, and not just the bad. History, magic, and science all culminate inside the small city to provide a booming culture surrounding the Magi and the Varamhari state. The Magi especially, provide a point of prowess. If we were to control the Magi, it would help add on to our legitimacy in the public eye. Of course that would put us at odds with the Varamhari state, but the value of being able to cooperate with the Magi to restore Bulwar cannot be understated.\n\nSome of the Magi have already given us the blessing for conquest, but in return, have asked for more freedoms to their spells. There is no problem with allowing the mages more freedom, it would even help us to expand the lacking space of mages in our country. The Magi have told us that the best place to do this would be in the center of magic in the area, a place known as Ulmiš Idiqlat. There have apparently been plans already devoted to the area to begin construction on a large university that we could take advantage of. That though, would require us to control the land.* | <li>traz buranun area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>has adm advisor 3 yes</li><li>has dip advisor 3 yes</li><li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li> | <li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_mages</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul> | [No More Boundaries](#shaz_no_more_boundaries)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_preparing_the_magi">Preparing The Magi</a><br />*Every Bulwari mage was an elf, with humans banned from the practice. But though the Magi have taken their toll in our fighting, they have a place under our rule. And perhaps that place should be Ulmiš Idiqlat: proposed as a center of magical studies. Constructing it from the finest marble will be expensive, but not out of our reach. With this symbolic piece of work put into place, we hope to further our cooperation under the same white and gray banner.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>609:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 35</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier magic_estate_aiding_construction_1</li><li>has country modifier  magic_estate_aiding_construction_2</li><li>has country modifier   magic_estate_aiding_construction_3</li></ul> | <li>add estate influence modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_mages</li><li>desc = EST_SHAZ_MAGES</li><li>influence = 10</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = court_mage</li><li>skill = 3</li><li>culture = marble_dwarf</li><li>religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [Masters In Varamhar](#shaz_masters_in_varamhar)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_construction_grand_uni">Constructing A Grand University</a><br />*Ulmiš Idiqlat has been very well restored, with a thriving community of returning mages now fostering a new culture in the region, one of inquisition and enlightenment. Now, with the stones set in place, comes the process of building them up. The process of creating a grand university has been mentioned before, but we can do better than the old Varamhari government plans. Out of splendid marble, we will build a structure that ensures the Magi thrive, and our country thrives with it. The logistics of shipping stone so far may be challenging, but well worth the price.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>614:</li><ul><li>has building university</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Greatest Minds](../events/the_greatest_minds.md) happens</li><li>add treasury = -1000</li> | [Preparing The Magi](#shaz_preparing_the_magi)<br /> |
| <a name="shaz_shazstunbloth">Shazstunbloth</a><br />*First we will need volunteers: people not interested in power, political gain, wealth, or superiority, who choose righteousness above all else.\n\nNext, we will need thirty-six powerful mages, for they will contain the power needed to continue the plan.\n\nThere are fourteen spells to be kept in mind. Each of the mages will engrave these spells into the floor, and into slabs of marble that shall be placed around the room. What is most necessary is courage, for the volunteers must have the courage to give up their lives momentarily. Then, as their souls are lifted up, they will merge with the spells of the powerful mages, and absorb the energy, along with the marble, as they transform into something utterly new. \n\nWhatever is born will be confused. The mages must guide the creations out of the cave as they regain their former selves.\n\nLastly, we need an appropriate location. Just a small distance away from Varamhar, around five miles north, lay a cave. This is where it shall all take place.\n\nWe must have everything ready, for the New Moon shall mark our deadline.* | <li>manpower is at least 20</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>add mil power = -200</li><li>add manpower = -20</li><li>the event [The Vîhtebloth Arise](../events/the_vihtebloth_arise.md) happens</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_shazstundihr_marbleblood</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Constructing A Grand University](#shaz_construction_grand_uni)<br /> |
