| <a name="g_a_clan_in_the_spiderdens">A Clan in the Spiderdens</a><br />*The Spiderdens are a collection of caves and crevices named for the obscene amount of spiders that populate and call it home. The dangers of these caves is apparent immediately, with one only having to glance up briefly to see massive webs stretching through miles of still cave air, and those are only the ones visible to the darklight eye.\n\nEven here, in this seemingly neverending pit of predators and their hapless victims, we goblins have found a way to thrive, learning to live in a tenuous harmony with the spiders - wild and domesticated alike, creating a society suspended on their iron-hard webs.* | <li>manpower is at least 30</li> | <li>add manpower = -15</li><li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_spider_colonies for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="g_perfecting_venombrew">Perfect Venombrew</a><br />*Where a dwarf has his favorite ale, a goblin has his favorite stimulant.\n\nVenombrew began its history as a common tincture used by goblins and extracted from the fangs of the spiders that live amongst them. Spider venom has a variety of effects depending on the species, but the kind that are dominant within the Spiderdens were known for producing a type of venom with a curious, hallucinogenic side-effect. Goblins of the Spiderdens have always been known for ingesting the substance pure to whip themselves into painless furies for raids, but our clan has come up with a recipe for turning it into a sweet drink and a damn good time.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>quartermaster is at least 1</li><li>natural scientist is at least 1</li><li>spymaster is at least 1</li><li>court mage is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add prestige = 100</li><li>add splendor = 100</li> | [A Clan in the Spiderdens](#g_a_clan_in_the_spiderdens)<br /> |
| <a name="g_uniting_the_spiderlands">Uniting the Spiderlands</a><br />*The Spiderdens have long been a hotbed of conflict between both rival clans of goblins and spider families vying for domination over territory. Now, united under our tattered banner, we have come to rule over this land of predators and their cruel machinations.\n\nWith the thrones of the crushed clans embedded into our boss's own grand throne, and their trusted spider steeds consumed by the boss's personal broodmother, we now rule uncontested over the fangs and webs necessary to ensnare the rest of the Serpentspine.* | <li>travelers refuge area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>westnest area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>eastnest area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_spider_trainers for 25 years</li> | [Perfect Venombrew](#g_perfecting_venombrew)<br /> |
| <a name="g_all_encompassing_ruler">All Encompassing Ruler</a><br />*The ruler of a goblin clan often has somewhat loose control over their subjects, as ruling over a race as unruly as the goblins is a task that comes difficult, even to goblins themselves. However, the dwellers of the Spiderdens have always done things a little differently.\n\nRuling from thrones of iron-hard web, often commandeered by our strongest warriors from absolutely massive broodmothers, our rulers have reigned with a surprising degree of control - as is necessary in a land where one wrong move can often mean the doom of the whole clan.\n\nIt is said that from these thrones of web they can sense even minor disturbances in their territories from the vibrations made through the ever-expanding weave.* | <li>num of cavalry is at least 10</li><li>army tradition is at least 50</li><li>num of cities is at least 20</li><li>has country modifier goblin_military</li> | <li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_spider_khan for 20 years</li><li>define general:</li><ul><li>shock = 6</li><li>fire = 3</li><li>manuever = 4</li><li>siege = 3</li><li>name = "Goblin Kan"</li><li>trait = born_to_the_saddle_personality</li></ul> | [Uniting the Spiderlands](#g_uniting_the_spiderlands)<br /> |
| <a name="g_the_clan_on_spiderback">A Clan on Spiderback</a><br />*The sight of the massive webs and spiders infesting the open air of the Spiderdens has long been a source of fear for its denizens, with poets from the age of the dwarves describing our lands as wild and brutal, to be avoided and prepared for when necessity comes to enter them. Unfortunately for them, our clanboss has decided that the scope of these dens is insufficiently small for the grand imagination of our peoples.\n\nSoon the entire Serpentspine will bear witness to our empire, with the Spiderdens serving as the beating heart for a new Dwarovar of silk and spiders.* | <li>num of cavalry is at least 20</li><li>cavalry fraction is at least 0.6</li><li>army tradition is at least 80</li><li>num of cities is at least 40</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>technology group is tech_goblin</li><li>technology group  is tech_cave_goblin</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_spiderwretch until otherwise removed</li><li>override country name = PAUZKLAN</li> | [All Encompassing Ruler](#g_all_encompassing_ruler)<br /> |
