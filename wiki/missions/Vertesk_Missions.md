| <a name="A23_tower_renovations">Black Tower Renovations</a><br />*Bal Vertesk, the ancient Castanorian Citadel that serves as our namesake has long been the centerpiece of our city, even as numerous flags have come and gone. Once the seat of the dreaded Vertesk Dominion at the time of the War of the Sorcerer King, the tower still bears the scars of this conflict. While no two tellings of history recount the same cause, the tower’s crest was long ago shorn from its height. Merely holding a few administrative offices, a small garrison, and the headquarters of our constabulary, the stories of its old terrors are hardly more than a tale to scare misbehaving children. We will reinforce the crumbling stones, and see that the Black Tower stands renewed and ever-vigilant, cultivate myths and rumours of its terrifying nature.* | <li>216:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction great_project</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 300</li></ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 300</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Leviathan":</li><ul><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -300</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has 216 has great project has type is bal vertesk, and has great project has tier is 0:</li><ul><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_renovations</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_renovations</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_renovations_alt</li><li>duration = 1825</li></ul></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="A23_shadow_of_bal_vertesk">Shadow of Bal Vertesk</a><br />*While we had initially envisioned a simple restoration of the Bal Vertesk’s former majesty, the project has evolved. More than to simply replace its crumbling stones, we’ve worked to see that the tower shall stretch far above the city, casting the shadow of its jagged crenelations and great crest down upon our people, like the maw of a great dragon, and filled its empty chambers with our most zealous sycophants. They shall know that, to step out of line is to be dragged away to Venac's lair, to see that great maw snapping shut upon them.* | <li>216:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction great_project</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 2</li></ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 2</li></ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 5</li><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 5</li><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Leviathan":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = A23_black_tower_1</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have 216 has great project has type is bal vertesk, and has great project has tier is 2; and does not have 216 has great project has type is bal vertesk, and has great project has tier is 3:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -300</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_renovations</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier A23_black_tower_renovations_alt for 5 years</li></ul> | [Black Tower Renovations](#A23_tower_renovations)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_expand_the_surveillance">Expand the Surveillance</a><br />*The great and jagged crest of Bal Vertesk cast in shadow sees that our citizens scamper fearfully from building to building, hardly willing to tarry. We should capitalize on their fear. While the tower’s garrison has largely overlapped with our constabulary, we should see to it that they can better utilize the information procured by our spies. Let us consolidate our foreign and domestic espionage with the efforts of our lawmen. With our security efforts tightly cooperating at every level, we shall have eyes on every troublemaker, no whisper will leave a mouth without reaching our ears.* | <li>216:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction great_project</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 2</li></ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 2</li></ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>dip is at least 5</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>dip is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Leviathan":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add mil power = -200</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>remove province modifier = A23_black_tower_2</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have 216 has great project has type is bal vertesk, and has great project has tier is 2; and does not have 216 has great project has type is bal vertesk, and has great project has tier is 3:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add mil power = -200</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_renovations</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier A23_black_tower_renovations_alt for 5 years</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul></ul> | [Shadow of Bal Vertesk](#A23_shadow_of_bal_vertesk)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_darkest_tower">The Darkest Tower</a><br />*One of our advisors has come to us with a delightfully sinister modification to the Black Tower. They speak of a ‘Panopticon’, a novel idea. While the concept was crafted to keep prisoners in line, it shall more effectively serve to ensure that no skulduggery but that which occurs at our own direction will be permitted on the streets of our city.\n\nWhile our people tremble for the shadow the tower casts in the daylight, they shall scamper in fear from the beams of light that sweep down from it in the darkness, stripping them of their secrets. While our network of spies and informants easily roots out miscreants’ rendezvous, there’s hardly a greater terror, even among the torture inflicted on our prisoners than one of Bal Vertesk’s great beams of light turning night to day, as our watchmen round the corner.* | <li>216:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction great_project</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Leviathan"</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>has great project:</li><ul><li>type is bal_vertesk</li><li>tier is at least 3</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>mil power is at least 300</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 6</li><li>dip is at least 6</li><li>mil is at least 6</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>adm power is at least 300</li><li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>mil power is at least 300</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 6</li><li>dip is at least 6</li><li>mil is at least 6</li></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Leviathan":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>add adm power = -300</li><li>add dip power = -300</li><li>add mil power = -300</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = A23_black_tower_3</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_4</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if does not have 216 has great project has type is bal vertesk, and has great project has tier is 3:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -750</li><li>add adm power = -300</li><li>add dip power = -300</li><li>add mil power = -300</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_black_tower_renovations</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier A23_black_tower_renovations_alt for 5 years</li></ul> | [Expand the Surveillance](#A23_expand_the_surveillance)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_inevitable_confrontation">Inevitable Confrontation</a><br />*The Gawedi have long coveted the city of Vertesk. Quite obviously, our fine city is a shining beacon, in contrast to the ramshackle village of Gaweton. It seems like it was only a matter of time until this claim would be contested. We’ve fought this fight before, and none can say who started this round, but we’re damn well going to end it, and take back what they’ve stolen!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is in war:</li><ul><li>attackers is Gawed</li></ul><li>is in war:</li><ul><li>defenders is Gawed</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Gawed</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "thriving_arms_industry" for 5 years</li><li>add army tradition = 5</li> |  |
| <a name="A23_beat_gawed">Retake Northern Lands</a><br />*From our peak as the Vertesk Dominion, dread vassal of Black Castanor, we’ve fallen far. Tenbury and Greenley, our de jure land sits mouldering in the grubby fingers of Gawed’s pretender-kings! We shall reunite with our kin, only separated by some coercive, long-forgotten treaty. This affront to our republic and the Empire itself cannot stand! We’ll show them the might of the truest Alenics, and rush over them like a flood cresting the banks of our furious river!* | <li>vertesk area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>floodmarches area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If dragonhills area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lorentish approach area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Inevitable Confrontation](#A23_inevitable_confrontation)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_contact_reachmen">Gathering Allies</a><br />*The Gawedi are on the back foot. We’ve recaptured our territory, and seen to it that they recognize us as their equal brethren. Even if we’re part of the Empire, we’ve not been softened by the elves, as they so often murmur. In fact, Lorent still owes us a few favours for our aid in the dismantling of Dameria, a nation that was toppled as easily as Venac toppled the Silmunas’ namesake.\n\nWe could stand back and laugh, as we watch the dainty knights of Lorent make them eat their words. Or, we might call upon our many squabbling little siblings in the Reach. Though the Blue Reachmen are far from us in land, we share a common brother, and a common enemy in Gawed. Long has the elder brother pushed his siblings about. Whether from their rival, or our fractured brothers to the north, we’ll easily hold the numbers to topple Gawed’s hegemony over the Alen.* | <li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>primary culture is blue_reachman</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Vertesk</li><li>value is at least 120</li></ul><li>is not vassal</li></ul> | <li>If every country has primary culture is blue reachman, and  has opinion has who is A23, and has opinion has value is 120; and  is not vassal:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = A23</li><li>value = 30</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul><li>add dip power = -300</li><li>the event [An Offer](../events/an_offer.md) happens</li> | [Retake Northern Lands](#A23_beat_gawed)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_brothers_war">The Brothers War</a><br />*All Alenics are brothers, but sadly siblings are prone to conflict. At least this is how we tend to justify our rivalry with Gawed. Nevertheless, the time for action has come. Our armies are strong and our allies are numerous and with that we will finally deal a crippling blow to Gawed, shattering their hopes of Alenic dominance.* | <li>lorentish approach area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is Gawed</li></ul></ul><li>dragonhills area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is Gawed</li></ul></ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Gawed</li><li>value is at least 0.6</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Lorent</li><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>primary culture is blue_reachman</li></ul></ul> | <li>221:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If south alen area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Gathering Allies](#A23_contact_reachmen)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_dominion_of_gawed">Dominion of Gaweton</a><br />*Delicious irony! Vertesk has reclaimed its rightful place at the head of the Alen. While we’ve always held this honoured seat as our land, we can now claim it in the vastness of our rule! The kings of Gawed spent long enough languishing in our halls, it’s time that we paint theirs in our blue banners, washing their petty tyrants away like the waters of the Alen. We’ll take their precious little city, and reshape it in our image.* | <li>south alen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>221:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add power projection:</li><ul><li>type = mission_rewards_power_projection</li><li>amount = 20</li></ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A13</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 480</li></ul> | [The Brothers War](#A23_brothers_war)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_secure_west">Secure the West</a><br />*The Moormen are a wild and untamed folk, a scattered and rowdy menace upon their desolate land. While most would overlook their domain as our ancestors in the Dominion did, our investments in the Floodmarshes have proven how much value detestable swamps such as theirs can hold. In taking these, we can proudly say we’ve surpassed Black Castanor’s old vassal. We’re ready to stretch beyond those ancient borders, subjugate our most uncivilized, wildest brethren.* | <li>europe:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is Westmoors</li></ul></ul><li>accepted culture is moorman</li><li>beronmoor area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>moorhills area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>westmoor proper area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>coddorran heights area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = 200</li><li>If mawriver area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If serpentshead area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Begin the Consolidation](#A23_are_we_the_baddies)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_lords_of_gerudia">Lords of Gerudia</a><br />*While Gawed is ours, we mustn’t rest easy. Bjarnrík, and other Gerudian nations look upon the Reach with hunger, just as the Gawedi eyed our own lands not long ago. Whether they wish to contest us in conquest or commerce, we shall not be put down by some pitiful barbarians! Our spies and merchants will work double time to cripple their efforts. We’ll take any measure. Undercutting their merchants, laying bare the scandalous secrets of their nobles.\n\nThe loose hand they keep on their commoners empowers the sort of delinquents that would languish in the Black Tower’s bowels in our own land. We’ll set anyone we can buy or blackmail to slandering their goods, slitting throats, stirring up trouble with the trolls. No tactic is too low or too simple to frustrate their efforts, and turn them from the reach.* | <li>exists is Bjarnrik</li><li>full idea group is spy_ideas</li><li>full idea group  is trade_ideas</li><li>Z08:</li><ul><li>trade embargo by is Vertesk</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul> | <li>Z08:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier A23_debuff_4 for 20 years</li><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = A23</li><li>modifier = vertesker_sabotage</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Z08</li><li>value = -100</li></ul></ul> | [Secure the West](#A23_secure_west)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_head_crown">The Head and the Crown</a><br />*No longer shall Vertesk be sneered at by our southern neighbors. We’ve seen to it that all of Cannor clamors for the trusted mark of the Black Tower upon their goods. While there may be some protest over a few curious accidents and disappearances of competing merchants, none can deny that we loom over the trade of The Dameshead just as Bal Vertesk looms over our city.\n\nFurthermore, thanks to our efforts in the north, the Serpentshead bows just as low. From the White Harbor to the rough streets of Revrhavn, there’s hardly a soul who can contest the prices and quality of our goods. Or at least none so unwise as to do so in the open.* | <li>mercantilism is at least 65</li><li>num of light ship is at least 50</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>696:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier A23_head_crown_mod for 35 years</li> | [Establish Northarbour](#A23_northarbour)<br /> |

| <a name="A23_halflings">Halfling Citizenship</a><br />*We have a little problem in our city. It’s hard to say when they first appeared, but for as long as anyone can remember, some of the ragamuffins on our streets have remained about half the size they should be for the full course of their lives. While we’ve long thought them to be a source of trouble, we could stand to benefit from extending the full privileges of citizenship to Halflings.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>adm is at least 4</li> | <li>the event [Halfling Citizenship](../events/halfling_citizenship.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="A23_settle_marshes">Settle the Floodmarshes</a><br />*The Floodmarshes have long defined perception of our realm, having been our largest stretch of land as Gawed forced us to cling to the edges of the coast. Historians could talk your ear off about them being some fertile grassland before the Day of Ashen Skies, when the waters came, severing the Dameshead, and drowning many of Cannor’s coasts. However, we have a practical eye. Even if the salty marshes will never again be some fertile heartland, we can find something to do with the land.\n\nIt’s easy enough to make an example of troublemakers, whether shedding their blood in the bowels of our tower, or casting them down from the top to make a show of things. However, we could devise yet another punishment to put in our arsenal. The particular unpleasantness of life in the turgid muck should serve as plenty of deterrent. We’ll send some of our troublemakers and rivals out to the salt marshes, and even make a bit of money from their exile.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>215:</li><ul><li>development is at least 7</li></ul><li>214:</li><ul><li>development is at least 7</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>215:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>214:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Halfling Citizenship](#A23_halflings)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_establish_spy_network">Establish Spy Networks</a><br />*To invest in ourselves will only advance our efforts so far. It’s time we fall back on our old ways. Using the extensive network of shady contacts that allow us to leverage the harsh control we keep over Vertesk and our other holdings, we can reach out to their contacts around the Dameshead. With their aid, every whisper shall reach our ear. More than simply allowing us to snuff out any plots that would hamper our efforts, these spies should allow us to actively impede the efforts of our competitors. * | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>has idea group spy_ideas</li><li>spy ideas is at least 1</li><li>Have an advisor of type spymaster</li><li>A23:</li><ul><li>any rival country:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>A23:</li><ul><li>any rival country:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier A23_spy_network_mod for 25 years</li> | [Settle the Floodmarshes](#A23_settle_marshes)<br />[Expand the Harbour](#A23_expand_harbour)<br /> |

With the staunch isolationism of the Uelairey so often turning our ships from their ports at the slightest excuse, we’ve often found our goods shut out of potentially lucrative markets.

Gawed seemed inevitable, the hegemon of the Alen. Damescrown held a monopoly on the Empire’s trade. But, even with the odds stacked against us, Vertesk prospered, finding opportunity in every tragedy and threat. Since those days, our people have been united by a common goal. We’ve sought to reclaim our old glory, and to forge a realm worthy of the name we now take.

Currently they have no goal but to earn some quick coin and move away from us, but our traders believe there is some use for them.

Colonies in Aelantir are full of orcs, and a large part of them remember seeing Black Tower as they passed through the city chained together.

Regardless of their grudges, it is time for Vertesk to change and move past slavery. With the support of the guilds, we will return Vertesk to the days of old from before chained orcs walked towards the harbour.

And we were right, there were no orcs who chose to stay in Vertesk, as that choice was made by their owners staying in Vertesk. And thus, a small population of orcs stayed in Vertesk and kept expanding until the slave trade was banned. Currently the recently freed orcs live in the worst parts of the city, even worse than where the Halflings are. In the recent meeting in Vertesk the question of orcs was brought up and a curious idea was born - calling the slave trade a mistake and giving orcs citizenship.\n\nWhile some laughed at a mere proposition, most decided that using actually putting orcs to use - albeit without chains - would be beneficial to Vertesk. By improving their living conditions and generally trying to atone for our previous misdeed against orcs we might get new useful hands in the city, large and green hands which will surely find use in Vertesk.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type diplomat</li><li>advisor  is statesman</li></ul><li>stability is at least 1</li> | <li>add stability = -1</li><li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>floodmarches area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>251:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>medium increase of orcish tolerance effect = yes</li> | [The Old Way](#A23_old_way)<br /> |

The need for a third tower has become plain and obvious, thanks to the many disputes and rebellions from the ever-squabbling Reachmen. Let us raise this monument to our grandeur in the city of Bayvic, our most vital and volatile holding in the reach. Furthermore, it will allow us to keep an eye on the goblins of the city.\n\nWith this we shall finally have a northern hub for our administration, and see that the Reach is as thoroughly cleansed of dissent as our nearer holdings. The tower’s perch near the city’s harbour will allow great displays of beneficence and justify our surveillance, as its great searchlights illuminate not only the doings of ne’er-do-wells, but the risky rocks in the Bayvic’s harbour, giving our merchants safe passage.* | <li>treasury is at least 3500</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>owns core province 723</li><li>723:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building trade_depot</li><li>has building  stock_exchange</li></ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -3500</li><li>add adm power = -200</li><li>add mil power = -200</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>723:</li><ul><li>change culture = vertesker</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = A23_grey_tower</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Secure the East](#A23_secure_east)<br /> |

It’s time we give some proper care to those lands.\n\nWe’ll support the Old Alenics in taming their forests, the Reachmen and Westmoors in exploiting the teeming shoals of the Giants’ Grave.

While its modern existence has been rather uneventful, save a few peculiar incidents such as a pivotal role in sparking the Great Fire of 1422, a disaster that came about as a consequence of an ill-fated attempt to bring Esmari river parties onto the Alen. While the harbour’s rather modest state isn’t a great shame upon our city, if we claim to have serious naval ambitions, it would be irresponsible not to invest in our navy’s central hub. In building it up, and modernising Vertesk’s harbour, we have the opportunity to expand our fleet, and truly rule the waves of the Dameshead.* | <li>216:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>221:</li><ul><li>is strongest trade power is this nation</li></ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building trade_depot</li><li>has building  stock_exchange</li></ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>has building drydock</li><li>has building  naval_battery</li><li>base manpower is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier A23_the_arsenal until otherwise removed</li> | [Dominate Northern Trade](#A23_dominate_north_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_seagulls">The Black Seagulls</a><br />*The Black Seagulls, a name shared between our boarding parties, and the dark-feathered, ill-tempered birds of our harbour. Perfectly exemplifying the vicious opportunism of both, the name has come to mean, our most ruthless, cunning sailors are experts in manning smaller vessels that deftly swoop into the fiercest of battles and snatch prize after prize to add to our fleet. After all, what’s better than a ship commissioned on someone else’s coin?\n\nWhile previously, these specialists have often been mercenaries, common fishermen, or even merchants looking to turn quick profit, it’s time we formalise these agreements, and institutionalise the tactics that have given such great success to the Black Seagulls.* | <li>num of galley is at least 40</li><li>galley fraction is at least 0.75</li><li>num of admirals with traits is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier A23_fleet_capture for 25 years</li> | [Expand Vertesk Arsenal](#A23_expand_arsenal)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_source">Directly from the Source</a><br />*Despite Dookanson being defeated by Corin marking the end of the orcish invasion for most of Cannor some smaller orcish tribes managed to survive. The existence of free orcs trying to establish themselves a home in Escann would not bode well for our slave trade. Thus, we have devised a mission for adventurers which involves doing a small expedition into those tribes to capture some of them and sell to us.\n\nThe adventurer captain however stated that he would require more support from us than usual. We don't tend to get our hands dirty, at least not obviously, but this idea seems promising to many in our government. Striking fear into orcish hearts and letting them know that they will have to face the Black Tower one day or other sounds like something we want our future trade goods to think.* | <li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is orcish</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 90</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>add army tradition = 10</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Rewards for Adventurers](#A23_reward_adventurers)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_goblins">Goblin Entrepreneurs</a><br />*The Floodmarshes, despite our attempts at settling and developing the area, have remained an embarrassing part of Vertesk. With the rise of orcish slave trade some locals of the marshes have proposed using orcs as tools for development. While we certainly are the best at selling orcs this much cannot be said about us using orcish labour. But we know someone who does. Goblins, another type of creature originating from the mountains, have broken free from orcish yoke and switched the roles, using them as slaves now. Perhaps we can contact them and learn how to actually use orcs as slaves more efficiently?* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Vertesk</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 80</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>floodmarches area:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Contacts in Escann](#A23_contacts)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_half_orcs">Half-Orcish Connections</a><br />*Our employment of half-orcs as adventurers and guards for orcish slaves has proven mutually beneficial. Many half-orcs chose to settle in Vertesk and became somewhat influential among our adventurer guilds. As we could always make use of more half-orcs the decision was made to seek out half-orcs who have settled elsewhere to give them employment opportunities and places to live in Vertesk. While some in our country are opposed to giving half-orcs too much influence, the government isn't worried.

While Vertesk is known for our commercial use of orcs, dwarves are the experts at fighting them. Every now and then we have some unruly orcs who for some reason really dislike the idea of going to Aelantir and try freeing themselves. This cannot stand and those slaves must be put in their place. A proposal has been made to send a diplomatic mission to one of those dwarven states and learn from them what exactly makes an orc obedient.* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>region is west_dwarovar_region</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Vertesk</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>216:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>floodmarches area:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add orcish minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Increase the Numbers](#A23_increase_numbers)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_underground_trade">Underground Slave Trade</a><br />*The slave trade has brought prosperity to Vertesk, and we are not going to let go our hegemony over orcish slaves that easily. They may ban the slave trade and prevent us from parading the chained orcs around the city but they cannot force us to stop the trade for good. By contacting the colonies in need of new workers and avoiding the Cannorian overlords directly we would be able to establish an underground network of slave trade, far away from the prying eyes of those lawmakers who are jealous of our wealth.* | <li>216:</li><ul><li>trade goods is slaves</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Vertesk</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul><li>is colonial nation</li></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>add years of income = 1.5</li><li>complete mission = A23_old_way</li><li>complete mission = A23_mistakes_of_past</li> | [Green Trade Hegemony](#A23_green_trade_hegemony)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_outside_cannor">Outside Cannor</a><br />*As much as we hate to admit it, we cannot keep the slave trade on the same scale as we did before. Vertesk can no longer act as a city of chains and a main port for slaves... but it also doesn't have too. While the ban has ended the slave trade in Cannor, it says nothing about Cannorian powers moving slaves from outside of Cannor to Aelantir. By establishing a new slave trade center elsewhere, we would be able to continue our extremely profitable trade. How would the slaves get there from Escann? Well, nobody should care about such details anyway.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>base production is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier A23_outside_cannor for 50 years</li><li>If random owned province does not have superregion is western cannor superregion, and does not have superregion is escann superregion; and  has base production is 15:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = slaves</li></ul> | [Underground Slave Trade](#A23_underground_trade)<br /> |

Much as Venac rebuked Munas, the Old Alenic folk had no need of even a great leader, for some common Woodsman was the bane of Ianren of Arbaran. Tales of werewolves and great beasts have always spilled from the lips of our rivermen.\n\nNearly as thick and mystical as the Deepwoods, we find ourselves laughing when the Gawedi cry in fear for the Redglades, a little thicket that could hardly stand up to those in the lands of our own people. Regardless of these tales, the one certain truth of the region is the scourge of banditry that hampers our trade. If we truly want a link to Escann, and to style ourselves as lords of the Alen, we must hold the east in our grasp.* | <li>accepted culture is old_alenic</li><li>europe:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is Greatmarch</li></ul></ul><li>alenvord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>balvord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>jonsway area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 200</li><li>If west chillsbay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If drowned giant isles area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Begin the Consolidation](#A23_are_we_the_baddies)<br /> |
| <a name="A23_east_reach">Gray Usurpers</a><br />*While old Vertesk Dominion claimed the western Alenic Reach, our fellow subjects of Castanor in Vrorenmarch did so in the eastern Reach. And now, they are gone. Concurrent to the Greentide, the former lands of Vrorenmarch faced the Graytide and were utterly defeated, replaced by the Gray Orcs. Since then the orcs have formed Grombar, a country whose interests in the north conflict with ours.\n\nLucky for us, many merchants in the Reach are still human and would be more likely to trade with us than those gray usurpers. Using this newfound influence, we should disrupt Grombari trade routes across the Reach and Gerudia, which will surely undermine their efforts in the region.* | <li>exists is Grombar</li><li>full idea group is spy_ideas</li><li>full idea group  is trade_ideas</li><li>Z50:</li><ul><li>trade embargo by is Vertesk</li><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul> | <li>Z50:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier A23_debuff_4 for 20 years</li><li>add opinion:</li><ul><li>who = A23</li><li>modifier = vertesker_sabotage</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>add spy network in:</li><ul><li>who = Z50</li><li>value = -100</li></ul></ul> | [Secure the East](#A23_secure_east)<br /> |
