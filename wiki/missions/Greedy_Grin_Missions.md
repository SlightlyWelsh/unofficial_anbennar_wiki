| <a name="greedy_grin_create_vault">Create a Great Vault</a><br />*Every goblin in Greedy Grin knows that a large coin collection will bring them luck. But the great vaults of Verkal Gulan have shown us just how big a collection can get.\n\nWe will improve upon the dwarves' designs to create a coin vault that will span an entire province and bless us one and al with luck once it is filled.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>4085:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>4086:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>4087:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>4087:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4085:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>4086:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = greedy_grin_small_coinvault</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Expand into the Caverns](#greedy_grin_expand_into_caverns)<br /> |
| <a name="greedy_grin_create_vault_guard">Create the Vault Guard</a><br />*The coin vault was hardly finished when errant goblins first attempted to pilfer some coins. So far, each attempt has been successfully thwarted -- we built plenty of watch-posts into the dwarven foundations --  but it is clear that we should invest in creating a vault guard to protect the coin vault from any inventive thief. And, of course, we need extremely strict requirements for these vault guards, so that they don't take anything home themselves.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>manpower is at least 15</li><li>4087:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has building ramparts</li></ul><li>4085:</li><ul><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has building ramparts</li></ul> | <li>add manpower = -15</li><li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>4085:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = greedy_grin_vault_guard</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4087:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = greedy_grin_vault_guard</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_vault_guard</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Create a Great Vault](#greedy_grin_create_vault)<br /> |
| <a name="greedy_grin_fill_vault">Fill the Vault</a><br />*The  vault is built. It is secured.

| <a name="greedy_grin_expand_vault_guard">Expand the Vault Guard</a><br />*More coins in the vault means more thieves after those coins, and the recent increase has gone beyond our treasurers’ expectations.\n\nWe must expand the Vault Guard in turn, though with their numbers getting high, perhaps a few can be tasked to protect other important areas as well.* | <li>manpower is at least 30</li><li>army tradition is at least 40</li><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>4087:</li><ul><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li></ul><li>4085:</li><ul><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li></ul><li>any hired mercenary company:</li><ul><li>template is merc_vault_guard</li></ul> | <li>add manpower = -30</li><li>add army tradition = -10</li><li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>4085:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = greedy_grin_vault_guard</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = greedy_grin_expanded_vault_guard</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4087:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = greedy_grin_vault_guard</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = greedy_grin_expanded_vault_guard</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Fill the Vault](#greedy_grin_fill_vault)<br /> |
| <a name="greedy_grin_vault_worthy">A Worthy Vault</a><br />*Every day more and more wealth is being produced and our clan is thriving more than ever, no doubt thanks to the coinvault we built and filled with 20,000 crowns, but this is still not enough and we should spend another 40,000 crowns, to fill the coinvault with mountains of pure gold coins, to further our prosperity and allow every goblin in our clan a further increase in luck.\n\n It will be truly marvelous.* | <li>treasury is at least 40000</li><li>stability is at least 3</li> | <li>add treasury = -40000</li><li>4086:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = greedy_grin_coinvault</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = greedy_grin_great_coinvault</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>change trade goods = gold</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier greedy_grin_coinluck until otherwise removed</li><li>the event [A Lucky Find](../events/a_lucky_find.md) happens</li> | [Expand the Vault Guard](#greedy_grin_expand_vault_guard)<br /> |

| <a name="greedy_grin_second_capital">A Second Capital</a><br />*Our conquest in the Tree of Stone and against the Command has expanded our nation by quite a bit and stretched our government.

| <a name="greedy_grin_hold_of_gold">A Hold of Gold</a><br />*We have information about a dwarven hold that is said to be made entirely of gold.

| <a name="greedy_grin_mountain_of_gold">A Mountain of Gold</a><br />*The rumor was true! Well, the entire hold is not made of gold, but between the amount of gold found in the vaults and the amount yet to be mined is enough to build an unimaginably huge mountain of gold.\n\nWe have found a Paradise. But gold is not the only think that sparkles bright, and we hear to the west, there is a gem-rich Hold ripe for the plunder.* | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>set capital = 2914</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gold</li></ul><li>the event [A Mountain of Gold](../events/a_mountain_of_gold.md) happens</li><li>seghdihr area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>4124:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier greedy_grin_colonization_focus_1 for 50 years</li> | [A Hold of Gold](#greedy_grin_hold_of_gold)<br /> |

Now it is time to invest our wealth and take control of the surrounding caves teeming with other goblins to increase the power of our nation.\n\nTo the east lies the  the Tree of Stone, teeming with our brethren, and Gor Ozumbrog will act as our stepping stone into there.* | <li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>4124:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier greedy_grin_colonization_focus_2 for 50 years</li><li>create conquistador:</li><ul><li>tradition = 50</li></ul><li>4078:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4218:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Plunder Seghdihr](#greedy_grin_plunder_seghdihr)<br /> |

That is where our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] places most of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] attention… but alas, the chief advisor cannot be denied when she points to our ever-growing population and its ever-growing needs.

One current problem, however, is the right to plunder: an idea we introduced when we reformed war taxes, but which often causes problems as some goblins grow rich from war, whiel others merely lose their land or limbs. If we eliminate the right to plunder and instead increase access to food for all goblins fighting as levies in our army and their families during war, not only will most goblins be happy, but the number of goblins we can raise and support will increase in turn.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army organiser is at least 3</li><li>army reformer is at least 3</li><li>recruitmaster is at least 3</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>government reform progress is at least 100</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>change government reform progress = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier greedy_grin_army_reforms until otherwise removed</li><li>remove country modifier = greedy_grin_war_tax_reform</li><li>remove country modifier = greedy_grin_system_feed_millions</li> | [Prosperity Through Peace](#greedy_grin_peace_time_prosperity)<br /> |

| <a name="greedy_grin_establish_levy_system">Establish the Levy System</a><br />*Other nations pay their armies to sit around and get drunk all day in peacetime - a complete waste of money that no Greedy Grin Clan goblin will ever allow.\n\nInstead, we will implement a levy system that will allow us to quickly raise an army for war and disband it afterwards to continue working in our mines and fields - this will be a great boon in times of peace, yet ensure we still have an effective army in times of war.* | <li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>add treasury = -300</li><li>2914:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = greedy_grin_peace_time_1</li><li>add province triggered modifier = greedy_grin_war_time_1</li></ul><li>set country flag [greedy_grin_levy_system_1](../flags/greedy_grin_levy_system_1.md)</li> | [Feeding a Nation](#greedy_grin_feeding_nation)<br /> |
| <a name="greedy_grin_war_tax_reform">War Tax Reform</a><br />*War taxes are a common idea in our clan, yet it takes effort to get people to actually pay them. By allowing our soldiers more of the loot, we can ensure that war taxes are paid less by our subjects -- and more by our conquests -- and make both our soldiers and our people happier.* | <li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>government reform progress is at least 50</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>treasurer is at least 3</li><li>philosopher is at least 3</li><li>master of mint is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -50</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>change government reform progress = -50</li><li>country gets the modifier greedy_grin_war_tax_reform until otherwise removed</li> | [Establish the Levy System](#greedy_grin_establish_levy_system)<br /> |
| <a name="greedy_grin_local_levy_stations">Local Levy Stations</a><br />*When we collect our levies, we often have to rely on the word of the locals that the number of troops they send is the right one. But thanks to our food system, we now have a clearer picture of any area’s actual population based on its food consumption.\n\nSince many goblins are not fulfilling their duty to fight for us as levies, we will be setting up local levy stations that, along with the food system, will determine the number of levies each province must send. This should give us much larger reserves in war and, since only registered goblins will have access to the food system, an easier time replenishing and reinforcing our troops while being cheaper overall.* | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 8</li><li>has building soldier_households</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 16</li><li>has building training_fields</li></ul><li>is at war</li> | <li>the event [War Time Demands New Innovation](../events/war_time_demands_new_innovation.md) happens</li> | [War Tax Reform](#greedy_grin_war_tax_reform)<br />[How To Feed Millions?](#greedy_grin_system_feed_millions)<br /> |
