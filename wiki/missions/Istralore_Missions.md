| <a name="A45_remove_wexonard_emperor">No Wexonard Emperor</a><br />*At the start of the Fourth Lilac War, much of the empire betrayed Grand Duke of Dameria and rightful emperor Adénn Skylance. An illegitimate election was held by the Rose Party, electing Lothane síl Wex as the emperor before Adénn could return from war, then ambushing him on his return.\n\nAs emperor, Lothane síl Wex destroyed the Grand Duchy of Dameria, partitioning it amongst himself and his conspirators. He would obviously oppose our ambitions to retake Dameria, and he'll be nearly untouchable while still emperor. Even if it means electing somebody else we don't want, the dukes of Wex are the worst choice in the empire.* | <li>A30:</li><ul><li>is not the emperor</li></ul> | <li>If damerian dales area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If the commons area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A45_reclaim_damerian_dales">Reclaim the Dales</a><br />*The Damerian Dales was the heart of our Lords, but was ripped from their body by the Wexonard Emperors after the Great Betrayal. That land is not theirs for the taking, and as the Regents of Dameria, it will once again belong to the Loyal.* | <li>damerian dales area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is istralore_silvelar_tooltip</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>the commons area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 281</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  910</li><li>328:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has reform free_city</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>5:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>2:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [No Wexonard Emperor](#A45_remove_wexonard_emperor)<br /> |
| <a name="A45_conquer_east_damesear">The Dame's East Ear</a><br />*The Ear was once home of the Damerians, but the Lilac wars finally shattered it. With the Silmuna gone and Dameria just a memory, control of the region should be up to whoever takes it. Wex controls it now. But that does not need to always be the case.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 2</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  5</li> | <li>If west damesear area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Reclaim the Dales](#A45_reclaim_damerian_dales)<br /> |
| <a name="A45_west_damesear">Control the Ear</a><br />*It is of paramount importance that the Damesear be rendered compliant and safe for imperial politics. A helpful Magisterium would do wonders for stability in the region, and is our preferred choice, but we must always consider their support of Wex in the last Imperial Election, and be aware that an allied Mage's Tower may not be possible.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is istralore_west_damesear_tooltip</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 3</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  6</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of   168</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Magisterium</li><li>A85:</li><ul><li>preferred emperor is Istralore</li></ul><li>3:</li><ul><li>owned by is Magisterium</li></ul><li>6:</li><ul><li>owned by is Magisterium</li></ul><li>168:</li><ul><li>owned by is Magisterium</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If wesdam area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If windtower area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>11:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [The Dame's East Ear](#A45_conquer_east_damesear)<br /> |
| <a name="A45_traitor_wesdam">Kinslayer's Sword</a><br />*Despite being led by the Silmuna dynasty, Wesdam betrayed Dameria in the Lilac Wars and fought with Lorent. The last duke of Dameria, Adénn Skylance was slain by a Erlan of Wesdam, a member of the house of Silmuna. Any dynastic claim they have is irrelevant, loyalty is what matters.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 11</li><li>wesdam area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If eastern winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If carneteria area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tretunica area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Control the Ear](#A45_west_damesear)<br /> |

| <a name="A45_traitorous_cestirande">Traitorous Cestirande</a><br />*Cestirande used to be a fellow vassal of the Grand Duchy of Dameria. During that time, their knightly orders would constantly compete with ours and we competed for dominance in Dameria's military.\n\nBut that was before the infamously dishonorable Vincen II síl Cestir saw the Fourth Lilac War disadvantaged Dameria, and betrayed us like the support Silmunas showed them meant nothing. In the aftermath of the war they gained control of the Heartlands, which had previously been part of the duchy of Istralore. Cutting us off from lands on the Luna river.\n\nTheir dishonorable approach to war has given them their snake-like borders. A clear sign of their treachery.* | <li>heartlands area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If middle luna area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>906:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Moonhaven](#A45_historical_ally)<br /> |
| <a name="A45_retake_middle_luna">Retake Middle Luna</a><br />*The Middle Luna was a part of the Grand Duchy of Dameria before the Lilac Wars. After Dameria's dissolution, it was mostly split into free cities.

It must return to the Damerian Regents and Anbennar, or we could maybe strike a deal with the Mages themselves, if certain conditions could be met.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>upper luna area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is istralore_magisterium_tooltip</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 298</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  327</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A85:</li><ul><li>owns core province 299</li></ul><li>owns core province 299</li></ul><li>alliance with is Magisterium</li><li>A85:</li><ul><li>owns core province 898</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If wexhills area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Retake Middle Luna](#A45_retake_middle_luna)<br /> |

These reforms to the imperial army will allow benefits for all of Anbennar.* | <li>277:</li><ul><li>has building training_fields</li><li>has building  university</li></ul><li>278:</li><ul><li>has building training_fields</li></ul><li>29:</li><ul><li>has building training_fields</li></ul><li>899:</li><ul><li>has building training_fields</li></ul><li>37:</li><ul><li>has building training_fields</li></ul><li>training fields is at least 10</li><li>university is at least 3</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "istralari_commanders_istralore" until otherwise removed</li><li>custom tooltip = istralore_istralari_commanders_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>every known country:</li><ul><li>If is part of hre, and does not have tag is A45:</li><ul><li>the event [Istralari Commanders](../events/istralari_commanders.md) happens</li></ul></ul></ul> | [A Legion for an Emperor](#A45_imperial_army)<br /> |

| Mission | Completion requirements | Effects | Prerequisites |
| ----- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| <a name="A45_imperial_liberation">Imperial Liberation</a><br />*Few will bother to fight when princes of the empire are attacked. Many will just leave their land to the attackers, and not press it more than a simple request. But not us, we will liberate the princes that have been conquered unjustly!* | <li>is in war:</li><ul><li>attacker leader is this nation</li><li>casus belli is cb_hre_attacked</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier "istralore_imperial_liberation" for 15 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A45_ally_silverforge">Ally the Forge</a><br />*Silverforge and Moonhaven are the only other electors that stayed loyal to Dameria in the Lilac Wars. They're a valuable imperial ally, not just for their influence, but also for their fine craftsmanship. Cheaper dwarven-made equipment will benefit our army.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Silverforge</li><li>Country is Empire of Anbennar</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "istralore_dwarven_deals" for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A45_protect_dameshead">Guard the Damesneck</a><br />*The Damesneck is the only entrance into the Dameshead, and control of it can keep out unwanted traffic, such as Gnollish pirates, and Lorenti Privateers. While we can not outright blockade the Rosen ports within the Dameshead, a large and powerful defensive fleet in the Neck should limit any unsavory actions taken against the Princes of the Realm. * | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of galley is at least 10</li> | <li>If damespearl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If eastneck area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A45_prepare_navy">The Sealion Proclamation</a><br />*Istralore's navy has been an afterthought of the country for too long. The old galleys are no longer relevant in global power. But Istralania was the captain of the Migrant Ship Estádha, and her symbol was a sealion. It is time to rebuild our fleet to proper standards. The first step is building shipyards for the fleet. Then we can issue an extra draft for sailors to run our ships.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Country is Istralore</li></ul><li>A45 ideas is at least 7</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>drydock is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "istralore_extra_sailors" for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A45_lease_forests">Forests of Moonhaven</a><br />*Istralore does not have quite the amount of timber needed to build a fleet, so until we can build up our own reserves it would be a good idea to perhaps lease some timber forests from our ally Moonhaven. This would give us time to grow our own timber fields as well as potentially deepen our bond with our ally.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Moonhaven</li><li>A31:</li><ul><li>owns core province 55</li></ul></ul><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 55</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 150</li> | <li>If has alliance with is A31, and has tag is Z01, and has A31 is subject of is A45:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier "istralore_moonhaven_forests" for 15 years</li><li>add treasury = -150</li><li>A31:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 150</li></ul></ul> | [The Sealion Proclamation](#A45_prepare_navy)<br /> |
| <a name="A45_moonhaven_admiral">Moonhaven Admiral</a><br />*Until our own officer corps upon the sea is sufficient, we require foreign aid to lead our vessels. We should request an admiral from our fellow elector of Moonhaven, to both lead our navy as well as glean tactics and knowledge of sea going expertise from them.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Moonhaven</li><li>A31:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Istralore</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li></ul><li>A31:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has A31 has exists; and has tag is Z01:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>the event [Moonhaven Admiral](../events/moonhaven_admiral.md) happens</li><li>A31:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul></ul> | [Forests of Moonhaven](#A45_lease_forests)<br /> |
| <a name="A45_construct_sealion_navy">The Estádha's Return</a><br />*To lead this great navy, we'll build a replica of the Migrant Ship Estádha, the ship Istralania herself was the captain of before The Landing. Historians and shipbuilders are studying what remains of it in Anbenncóst's Elvendocks district, and figuring out how it could be remade in a fashion functional with modern technology. Such a ship in our fleet would be an incredible symbol of Istralore, of Dameria, of Anbennar! First, we must construct ships until we can be sure our shipwrights are experienced enough for the task.* | <li>num of light ship is at least 30</li><li>num of heavy ship is at least 20</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "naval_enthusiasm_mission" for 25 years</li><li>custom tooltip = istralore_estadha_mission_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [istralore_remade_estadha](../flags/istralore_remade_estadha.md)</li> | [Moonhaven Admiral](#A45_moonhaven_admiral)<br /> |
