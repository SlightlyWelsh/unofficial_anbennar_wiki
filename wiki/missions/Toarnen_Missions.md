Then, we will fund Roilsardi professors to teach the administration and the nobility. After some years, most of those savages will need to speak Roilsardi to do any simple task in their lives. But it don't suffice, after they start speaking the Roilsardi dialect perfectly, we have to ban the Wexonard dialect on the pretense that it is incomprehensible to us - which I mean, isn't true, but it might as well be!* | <li>920:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>culture is roilsardi</li></ul><li>902:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>culture is roilsardi</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>920:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>902:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul> | [Barbaric Alenics](#A57_barbaric_alenics)<br /> |

We can't allow this weak-minded Arannese culture to thrive in another country after all those efforts! But we like elves, their legends are as glorious as the Crusade and most of our nobility and Roilsard's is composed of "half-elves". Thus, we will just borrow Téinmas. The Elves strangely asked we borrow it for four hundred years and that we pay half of it now and half of it at the end of the deal, with inflation included : As the past seems to be more glorious than the future in Anbennar, we have no reason to refuse.* | <li>320:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>311:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>total development is Ibevar</li><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>314:</li><ul><li>owned by is Ibevar</li></ul><li>A32:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 175</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>A32:</li><ul><li>the event [Toarnen propose to borrow Téinmas](../events/toarnen_propose_to_borrow_teinmas.md) happens</li></ul> | [North of Arannen](#A57_northern_aranneses)<br /> |
