| <a name="seghdihr_axe_for_sword">An Axe for a Sword</a><br />*The time has come, though many never thought they would see the day. We have thrown open the gates to the Seghrod and sent the first of many bands of dwarves out to reclaim our ancient realm. We have weathered the storm, though not without aid. The Surani have always been our stalwart allies and now, more than ever, their aid has been appreciated. New tactics and ideas permeate the human lands along the Suran and we should make use of them in our reclaiming of the Dwarovar. But nothing is given freely, least of all military assistance. We shall propose an exchange of military minds with the Akal of Azka-Sur. Given our history, there is no doubt they will accept.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li><li>treasury is at least 25</li><li>U20:</li><ul><li>trust:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 70</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -25</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = commandant</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = surani</li><li>religion = bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>U20:</li><ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = commandant</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = citrine_dwarf</li><li>religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul></ul> | [Side by Side with a Friend](#seghdihr_side_by_side)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_honor_ancestors_jaher">Honouring Sun and Stone</a><br />*For many years, the Surani had their God-Kings and, in time, their god of the sun, Surakel. Then came Jaher and the Sun Elves. Many proclaimed him their god reborn and so he began to forge his great Phoenix Empire. Though the Surani came to preach of their reborn god, now called Surael, we humoured them, but no god of men or elves could make us turn from honouring our ancestors as we have since time immemorial. Whether or not Jaher was Surael reborn or not, we had an excellent arrangement with him. We funded his blockade of Ovdal Tungr and provided him the service of the Seg Band for his personal guard. In exchange, we became the foremost and most trusted source of Dwarven expertise across Bulwar and the burgeoning Phoenix Empire. This simple, effective arrangement allowed Jaher to focus his expansion eastwards, towards Rahen and beyond. A pity that his daughter, Jexis, did not have his wisdom and instead she turned the Seg Band against their own kin.* | <li>4124:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul><li>U20:</li><ul><li>exists</li><li>is not subject</li></ul><li>643:</li><ul><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add legitimacy = 15</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = U20</li><li>value = 10</li></ul><li>U20:</li><ul><li>add legitimacy = 15</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = H78</li><li>value = 10</li></ul></ul> | [An Axe for a Sword](#seghdihr_axe_for_sword)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_coward_attack">A Coward's Attack</a><br />*Bulwar is gripped by fear, terror, and hatreds that simmered unseen for hundreds of years. All this chaos has been unleashed by an explosion at the Samartal Palace during a great gathering of the ruling elites of Bulwar. No Bulwari ruling family was spared the consequences of the attack, not even our neighbours Azka-Sur. Yet, they stand accused of being the perpetrators of the attack! Such dishonesty and insult cannot stand: An attack on Azka-Sur's honour is an attack on our own. Such is the depths of our friendship and we will not abandon our ally. Though this affair is ultimately between men and elves, we shall send volunteers south to assist Azka-Sur.* | <li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>U20:</li><ul><li>is incident active is incident_summit_of_samartal</li><li>is in war:</li><ul><li>defender leader is Azka-Sur</li><li>casus belli is cb_nsc_investigation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = -50</li><li>add manpower = -5</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add army tradition = 5</li><li>U20:</li><ul><li>add manpower = 5</li><li>define general:</li><ul><li>fire = 1</li><li>shock = 4</li><li>manuever = 2</li></ul></ul> | [Honouring Sun and Stone](#seghdihr_honor_ancestors_jaher)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_clear_infestation">Clear the Infestation</a><br />*After Gor Vazumbrog fell, there was no bastion left standing between the goblin hordes and the Inventor's Hold of Hehodovar, the heart of the Segbandal.While grinding years of warfare, bloodshed, and war slowed the invaders' advance, eventually the great hold of Hehogrim the Diligent was put to siege and overrun. Now, where scholars studied, engineers invented, and proud artisans worked, there is only a hollow shell. Squatting within are the creatures that defiled the holy works of Hehogrim.\n\nOne faction within Seghdihr has long argued that the reclamation of Hehodovar must be our foremost task if we ever hope to ensure the safety of our hold. With our renewed strength and focus on reclaiming the middle dwarovar, the time to fulfill this request has finally come. We will expel the goblins within the ruins of Hehogrim's Hold and restore it to its former glory!* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Hehodovar</li></ul><li>I15:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>hehos legacy area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Hehodovar</li><li>is city</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>hehos legacy area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>4078:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier damaged_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier    infested_hold</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = 50</li><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>add mil power = 50</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>hehos legacy area:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove core = ROOT</li><li>add core = I15</li></ul><li>cede province = I15</li></ul><li>If does not have I15 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>vassalize = I15</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>I15:</li><ul><li>If does not have capital is 4078:</li><ul><li>set capital = 4078</li></ul><li>If does not have primary culture is pyrite dwarf:</li><ul><li>change primary culture = citrine_dwarf</li><li>set ruler culture = citrine_dwarf</li></ul><li>change religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>set ruler religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>largest decrease of goblin tolerance effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = goblin_race_tolerance_ai</li><li>value = -20</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [An Alliance of Holds](#seghdihr_alliance_holds)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_broaden_minds">Broaden our Minds</a><br />*With Hehodovar reclaimed and the upper stories stabilised, the settlers who have returned to Hehogrim's Hold have begun the task of combing through the ruins for any treasure or knowledge left from before the fall. Hehodovar is far from its glory days, so much has been lost, but preliminary surveys of the old institutes of scholarship and invention indicate that they remain somewhat intact. Some of these places that were spared absolute destruction may still hold remnants of ancient knowledge. We should restore the workshops, laboratories, and schools of the Engineer's Hold and encourage our brightest minds to teach and work here. Who knows what they will achieve when they walk the same halls as the greatest inventors in the history of our people once did.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>natural scientist is at least 2</li><li>philosopher is at least 2</li><li>artist is at least 2</li></ul><li>4078:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is gold</li></ul></ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>If has dlc is "Rule Britannia":</li><ul><li>change innovativeness = 5</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 15</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_spark for 20 years</li> | [Clear the Infestation](#seghdihr_clear_infestation)<br /> |

| <a name="seghdihr_candle_lit">Keep the Candle Lit</a><br />* 'Azka-Sur and Seghdihr, regardless of the administration, have always been intertwined in our fates, many of our successes have been the successes of the Surani, and a number of yours, ours as well. It is with that then, on behalf of Seghdihr, and our ruler in particular, this pair of candles, rune-crafted to burn forever once lit, a symbol of not only the light of your Surael, but to symbolise the ever burning friendship the Dwarves of Seghdihr and the realm of Azka-Sur shall share until the mountains are naught but dust in the wind.' -Angdrim Fireforge, presenting the Candles of Azka-Sur and Seghdihr.* | <li>U20:</li><ul><li>exists</li><li>is not subject</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is neighbor of is Zokka</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>is neighbor of is Jaddari</li></ul></ul><li>total development is at least 200</li></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>If has dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>add splendor = 50</li></ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = U20</li><li>amount = 20</li></ul><li>U20:</li><ul><li>add favors:</li><ul><li>who = H78</li><li>amount = 20</li></ul></ul> | [An Axe for a Sword](#seghdihr_axe_for_sword)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_friends_gates">Friends at the Gates</a><br />*There are two gates from the Middle Dwarovar into Bulwar. The most famous is Seghdihr, which opens near the headwaters of the Suran, allowing us access to the wealth of Bulwar, and from there, beyond to Brasan and the Divenhal. The second gate in the time of the Segbandal was the Hero's Gate of Verkal Gulan. Though rarely opened after the end of the original Segbandal, it lies at the far edge of the Salahad, in territory that once belonged to harpykind and desert tribes. Now, our allies in Azka-Sur control the territory in front of both gates, and we control the territory within the mountains. Finally, traders may make safe usage of both Verkal Gulan and Seghdihr, let us invest in the local defences in Azka-Sur and the region outside of Hero's Vale to assure traders and visitors of the safety at our gates.* | <li>U20:</li><ul><li>exists</li><li>is not subject</li></ul><li>2915:</li><ul><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>643:</li><ul><li>Is held by Azka-Sur or its subjects</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2916:</li><ul><li>Is held by Azka-Sur or its subjects</li></ul><li>2917:</li><ul><li>Is held by Azka-Sur or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_safe_mountain until otherwise removed</li><li>643:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = seghdihr_dwarven_fortifications</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2916:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = seghdihr_dwarven_fortifications</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2917:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = seghdihr_dwarven_fortifications</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Keep the Candle Lit](#seghdihr_candle_lit)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_stronger_together">Stronger Together</a><br />*For centuries our doors have been sealed tight against the darkness pervading the Dwarovar. Suspicion, bitterness, and festering old rivalries kept us from reuniting with our once-allies in Verkal Gulan. When the Segbandal broke it was not solely due to the machinations of Jexis, our divisions had been growing for years and instead of reaching out and working with the gold dwarves, we spent the past centuries nursing grudges and hiding in our holds.\n\nThough we've always known the truth, our stubbornness blinded us and kept us from being honest: Our holds are stronger together. Our pettiness and suspicion damaged our alliance and our individual holds have never been as mighty or as prosperous as we were when we stood united. Our strengths compliment each other: We provide longstanding trade and diplomatic relations with the Surani people and access to the riches of Bulwar while easily acquirable and seemingly endless gold pours forth from the mines and refineries of Verkal Gulan. We cannot let internal divisions bring us to ruin again, let us foster a spirit of cooperation with the gold dwarves to remind them of the many benefits we enjoy when striving towards common goals.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Gold Citadel</li></ul></ul><li>verkal gulan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>2915:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>F47:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 50</li></ul><li>owns 2914</li></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have exists is F47:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>add mil power = 50</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>verkal gulan area:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove core = ROOT</li><li>add core = F47</li></ul><li>cede province = F47</li></ul><li>2915:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove core = ROOT</li><li>add core = F47</li></ul><li>cede province = F47</li></ul><li>vassalize = F47</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>F47:</li><ul><li>If does not have capital is 2914:</li><ul><li>set capital = 2914</li></ul><li>If does not have primary culture is gold dwarf:</li><ul><li>change primary culture = citrine_dwarf</li><li>set ruler culture = citrine_dwarf</li></ul><li>change religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>set ruler religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>largest decrease of goblin tolerance effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = goblin_race_tolerance_ai</li><li>value = -20</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>2914:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = seghdihr_gulan_investment</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_gulan_return for 25 years</li> | [An Alliance of Holds](#seghdihr_alliance_holds)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_hero_welcome">A Hero's Welcome</a><br />*Verkal Gulan, the Golden Citadel, guarded by the Hero's Gate, is known for two things: fabulous wealth and a deep distrust of outsiders.This was not always the case - once trade flowed freely into Verkal Gulan from both the other holds of the Middle Dwarovar and from the desert tribes beyond the Hero's Vale. The Gold Dwarves sealed themselves in their hold when the Segbandal was broken three hundred years ago and they have remained shut off from the world, their golden fortunes gathering dust in the innumerable vaults within their city.\n\nWith the rebirth of our alliance and improved security along renewed trade routes, the paranoia and isolation of the Gold Dwarves is becoming harder for them to justify. Now is the time to reconnect the Golden Citadel with the outside world, reopen the Hero's Gate, and welcome the world's traders and merchants back. Soon, the markets of Verkal Gulan will be filled with exotic, foreign goods and people once again. The roads and routes will be guarded by stalwart warriors who can fend off attacks by harpies and bandits. The Golden Citadel will grease the wheels of commerce with its wealth, rather than keeping it locked away in the darkness.* | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>owned by is Gold Citadel</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>province trade power is at least 25</li></ul><li>2915:</li><ul><li>owned by is Gold Citadel</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2914:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul> | [Stronger Together](#seghdihr_stronger_together)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_greatest_regret">Our Greatest Regret</a><br />*Gor Ozumbrog. The name tolls like a bell in the deep, deadening any conversation that utters it and leaving the speakers overwhelmed by regret and sorrow. The desires of Gor Ozumbrog to reclaim its lost twin hold were deferred for many years, and there were always justified reasons for the delay, until the Jexisian occupation. During that time Ozumbrog's last king, Ombrindal, demanded that the resources of the overdwellers be used to aid in the reclaiming of the lost hold. The leaders of the Seg Band disagreed.\nWhat occurred in the closed halls of government that day have been lost to time but the results were dire. Gor Ozumbrog broke with the Segbandal, the Seg Band, and by extension Seghdihr. The mercenaries strong-armed Seghdihr, Verkal Gulan, and Hehodovar into a punitive expedition that went farther than it ever should have. While it was the Seg Band who issued the orders in the end, it was we who followed, and it was Gor Ozumbrog which paid the deepest price.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Gor Ozumbrog</li></ul><li>I17:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li><li>ozumbrog area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is Gor Ozumbrog</li><li>is city</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>ozumbrog area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>4218:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier damaged_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier    infested_hold</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add adm power = 50</li><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>add mil power = 50</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>ozumbrog area:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove core = owner</li><li>add core = I17</li></ul><li>cede province = I17</li></ul><li>If does not have I17 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>vassalize = I17</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>I17:</li><ul><li>If does not have capital is 4218:</li><ul><li>set capital = 4218</li></ul><li>If does not have primary culture is topaz dwarf:</li><ul><li>change primary culture = citrine_dwarf</li><li>set ruler culture = citrine_dwarf</li></ul><li>change religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>set ruler religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>largest decrease of goblin tolerance effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = goblin_race_tolerance_ai</li><li>value = -20</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>ozumbrog area:</li><ul><li>remove claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Scars of the Past](#seghdihr_scars_past)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_honoring_dead">Honouring the Dead</a><br />*The Topaz Dwarves of Gor Ozumbrog are dead and their home is ruined. Nothing can change their fate and our wishes will not return them to us or change the course of their end. But we can remember them, the sacrifices they made for the Segbandal, and the culpability of our ancestors in helping to send Gor Ozumbrog to its slaughter. Let us honour their memories and set forward to exceed the Segbandal of old, rather than merely restoring it.* | <li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>4218:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has construction building</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has construction culture</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has construction missionary</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>has construction colonist</li></ul></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>influence is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>4218:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = cathedral</li><li>speed = 2</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_mourning for 5 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [A Dark Day](../events/a_dark_day.md) happens</li></ul><li>If does not have dlc is "Cradle of Civilization":</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = seghdihr_honoring_dead_tooltip</li></ul> | [Our Greatest Regret](#seghdihr_greatest_regret)<br /> |

| <a name="seghdihr_side_by_side">Side by Side with a Friend</a><br />*Just beyond the gates of our hold a river springs, burbling and flowing, to form the headwaters of the greatest river in Bulwar: the mighty Suran. Upon its riverbanks was once Logrod-Tungr, the River Harbour. In time, Logrod-Tungr changed,  becoming home to the human tribes who would become the Surani. In time, we aided their ascension into the Kingdom of Azka-Sur and entwined our fates with theirs. With the fall of Aul-Dwarov, we relied on the Surani for food and supplies we could not produce ourselves. Together, our two kingdoms have suffered greatly since the fall of the Segbandal and the Jaherian conquests. Now the world is quickly changing: The orcs have withdrawn for now, but gnolls are coming and the zealous are marching, but together we shall stand against them all!* | <li>U20:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_time_to_wake for 30 years</li><li>custom tooltip = seghdihr_side_by_side_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = awakeningReact</li><li>value = -30</li></ul><li>If is not controlled by the AI, and  has H74 has exists, and H74 is controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>H74:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_chaingrasper_no_die for 40 years</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If does not have dlc is "Cradle of Civilization":</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = seghdihr_side_by_side_tooltip2</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="seghdihr_back_mountain">Back into the Mountain</a><br />*Dwarven control over the Dwarovar has so long been in decline that we have been reduced to nothing but our own hold.

There are some organized tribes that may threaten our expeditions into the Dwarovar. Their squatting upon our roads and caverns must come to an end!

| <a name="seghdihr_alliance_holds">An Alliance of Holds</a><br />*The Segbandal, the centuries-old alliance between the five great holds of the middle dwarovar, is no more. It was shattered by threats from both without and within, weakened not only by goblin blades and elven scheming, but also by internecine bickering. Where once five holds stood united, three now lay in ruins and two stand apart, isolated and unfriendly towards each other. If we are to rebuild the Segbandal, we must start by reestablishing relations with Verkal Gulan, our surviving Sister Hold. Let us put aside our past rivalry and offer our hand in peace and friendship. We must also begin the reclamation of the fallen holds - starting with the nearest and most strategically located hold: Hehodovar. Bringing the Inventor's Hold back into the light of dwarven civilization will be vital to future restoration efforts.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Gold Citadel</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Gold Citadel</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>legitimacy is at least 90</li><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_leader until otherwise removed</li><li>If has exists is F47:</li><ul><li>F47:</li><ul><li>the event [The Old Alliance](../events/the_old_alliance.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>2914:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>2915:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>hehos legacy area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has exists is I15:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>target = I15</li><li>months = 600</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>hehos legacy area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Long Overdue](#seghdihr_long_overdue)<br />[The Seg Band](#seghdihr_seg_band)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_kings_dilemma">The King's Dilemma</a><br />*The Seg Band has been instrumental in our recovery, but their presence still causes unease among our population.

This was done via a series of vaults and tombs, the latter for individuals deemed too dangerous to be allowed freedom, and the former for items, magical and mundane.

In time, he learned that Ovdal Kanzad still stood, and so King Ombrindal went forth with the majority of the hold's forces to clear the Iron Road, the section of the Dwarovrod that stretched from Gor Ozumbrog to Ovdal Kanzad, and seal an alliance with the Amber Dwarves. Unfortunately, the treacherous Seg Band (backed by the Jexisian occupation of Seghdihr) took the opportunity to force the rest of the Segbandal into sacking Gor Ozumbrog and greatly weakened its defences. Without a secure Hold, King Ombrindal was forced to fall back from his quest to prevent Gor Ozumbrog's fall. He failed, and in time, so did the Segbandal.

Our famed trade network brings ever more merchants flocking to our gates, each craving a chance to taste of the Far East without needing to mount dangerous, difficult, months-long expeditions.* | <li>mercantilism is at least 50</li><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>amount is at least 2</li><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is silk</li><li>country has this</li></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is chinaware</li><li>country has this</li></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is spices</li><li>country has this</li></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is incense</li><li>country has this</li></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is tea</li><li>country has this</li></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is dyes</li><li>country has this</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 30</li><li>1350:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 50</li><li>key = SEGHDIHR_EASTERN_MONOPOLY</li></ul></ul><li>1361:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 50</li><li>key = SEGHDIHR_EASTERN_MONOPOLY</li></ul></ul> | [A Disturbed Land](#seghdihr_disturbed_land)<br /> |

| <a name="seghdihr_force_open">Force Open the Market</a><br />*Sramaya is the largest port in Rahen and in the mind of some of its inhabitants it is the only port in Rahen. Of course, if we wish to go further into Haless, we will need to visit other ports, but not before dealing with the greedy Bhuvauri who rule the Pearl of the Kharunyana. The consent of these slaves turned into slavers, either explicit or implied, is all that stands in the way of the SGC reaching into the markets of the Far East. Unfortunately, they are very protective of their monopolies.\nFortunately, we have no qualms about breaking these monopolies. The Far East will be opened to us, one way or another. * | <li>is not at war</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>1350:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 30</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Bhuvauri</li><li>1361:</li><ul><li>strongest trade power:</li><ul><li>Country is Bhuvauri</li></ul></ul></ul><li>R38:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is scornfully_insulted</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>1361:</li><ul><li>strongest trade power:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is scornfully_insulted</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>1361:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = 7300</li><li>power = 50</li><li>key = SEGHDIHR_OPENING_MARKET</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is R38, and  has 1361 has strongest trade power has tag is R38:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_trade_war</li><li>target = R38</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>1361:</li><ul><li>strongest trade power:</li><ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_trade_war</li><li>target = PREV</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [The Syndicates](#seghdihr_the_syndicates)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_everyone_benefits">Everyone Benefits</a><br />*Despite their reluctance the Bhuvauri are slowly changing their minds. We will show them how trade will benefit us both. It has taken both time and effort to make the Bhuvauri understand that relaxing restrictions to allow the SGC to operate with impunity in the Gulf of Rahen will only be mutually beneficial. With the great merchant interests based out of Sramaya broken and the Bhuvauri's consent, we can finally begin investing properly into the region to expand the SGC's influence and thus reap even greater benefits.* | <li>has estate privilege estate_burghers_sgc_foreign_power</li><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 60</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Bhuvauri</li><li>1361:</li><ul><li>strongest trade power:</li><ul><li>Country is Bhuvauri</li></ul></ul></ul><li>R38:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>is rival is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>1361:</li><ul><li>strongest trade power:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul><li>is rival is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = seghdihr_everyone_benefits_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [sgc_gulf_fullaccess](../flags/sgc_gulf_fullaccess.md)</li> | [Force Open the Market](#seghdihr_force_open)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_honorable_combat">Honourable Combat</a><br />*The Lands of the Xia are filled with men that constantly strive for martial perfection, something we greatly relate to. If we are to trade, we must earn the respect of their leader. The Land of the Xiaken. Home to great warriors and martial artists who dedicate their lives to perfecting martial mastery over innumerable methods and means of combat both lethal and not. No matter who rules in the lands of the Xia, there is only truly one thing these people respect above anything else: martial prowess.* | <li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>diplomat is at least 5</li><li>army professionalism is at least 0.5</li><li>does not have regency</li><li>4559:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul><li>is rival is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -200</li><li>the event [The King and Master](../events/the_king_and_master.md) happens</li> | [Everyone Benefits](#seghdihr_everyone_benefits)<br /> |
| <a name="seghdihr_center_world">Centre of Halann</a><br />*The Segbandal lies at the center of Halann. Both geographically, at the crossroads between south of Sarhal, the west from Cannor, and the east of Haless. They say the great city of Anbenncost is the heart of the world, Bah! Let them. Seghdihr and the Segbandal is the true heart of the world. Wealth the world over flows into our gates,  whether from the Serpentspine or the surface. Be it whale oil for the lamps from Uelos' lament, Kanzadi explosives, or silk ropes from Haless intended for adventurers, if you can purchase it, it is yours for the buying, and we always have a way to make our cut.* | <li>4124:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is highest value trade node</li><li>trade node value is at least 250</li></ul></ul><li>num of trading bonuses is at least 7</li> | <li>country gets the modifier seghdihr_center_world_modifier until otherwise removed</li> | [A Disturbed Land](#seghdihr_disturbed_land)<br />[Honourable Combat](#seghdihr_honorable_combat)<br /> |
