| <a name="A12_petition_the_emperor">Petition the Emperor</a><br />*Beepeck is the electorate representing the halflings of the empire. However, there are imperial halfling lands across our border in Orston. Orston is a de jure part of Exwes, and has been since before the Lilac Wars, but our right to represent the halflings of the empire should give us claims to this land. We can petition the emperor to cede these lands to us. Improving their opinion, and sending a bribe or maybe even allying the emperor will make them more likely to support us.* | <li>emperor:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>Beepeck</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>is an elector</li> | <li>If does not have owns is 157; and  has dlc is "Emperor":</li><ul><li>the event [Beepeck's Halfling Claims](../events/beepeck_s_halfling_claims.md) happens</li></ul><li>If does not have owns is 157; and does not have dlc is "Emperor":</li><ul><li>emperor:</li><ul><li>the event [Claims of the Halfling Elector](../events/claims_of_the_halfling_elector.md) happens</li></ul></ul> |  |

| <a name="A12_alliance_of_opportunity">Alliance of Opportunity</a><br />*Gawed and Lorent have been fighting over the Small Country for hundreds of years now. After the Viswall rebellion in 1423, they entered a bit of an agreement for a while to split the Small Country in half. However neither side is content with leaving their rival with half the Small Country. Allying one of these two kingdoms will give us the best opportunity to take Small Country land away from the other. Even if they want it for themselves, they'd definitely be happy with our help getting it away from their rival, even if we keep it for ourselves.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Lorent</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Gawed</li></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Gawed</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Lorent</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = alliance_of_opportunity_tooltip</li><li>If has alliance with is A01:</li><ul><li>If lorentish approach area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If norley area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>66:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has alliance with is A13:</li><ul><li>If the borders area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If thomsbridge area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>63:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul> | [The Halfling Electorate](#A12_halfling_elector)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_liberate_small_country">Liberate the Small Country</a><br />*The Small Country has been under control of foreign human kingdoms for too long. We are the only powerful independent halfling country, so as the representative of halflings in the empire, we shall liberate the halflings and represent them as one Small Country.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>lorentish approach area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>norley area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>the borders area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>thomsbridge area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier "army_enthusiasm" for 25 years</li> | [Alliance of Opportunity](#A12_alliance_of_opportunity)<br /> |

| <a name="A12_heavy_ships">Heavy Ships</a><br />*Halflings are too small to properly operate galleys that many humans in the Dameshead sea use for combat.

| <a name="A12_conquer_uelaire">Conquer Uelaire</a><br />*Orston was the most egregious case of unrepresented halflings, but to the north, all through the duchy of Uelaire there is a significant halfling population. There may be a majority Uelairey, but the large presence of halflings is enough to justify a conquest of the land.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 207</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  209</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of   347</li> | <li>If exwes area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Halfling Electorate](#A12_halfling_elector)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_conquer_exwes">Conquer Exwes</a><br />*Exwes' unrightful halfling county of Orston may be ours, but a notable halfling population was present in the rest of the duchy. We must continue to strive to unite the halflings of the empire. For this just cause, we will make any sacrifice, even the burden of controlling more wealthy land.* | <li>exwes area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add manpower = 5</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li> | [Conquer Uelaire](#A12_conquer_uelaire)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_colonial_endralliande">Colonize Endralliande</a><br />*Beepeck is somewhat overcrowded, and many halflings would like the opportunity to start a proper farm on their own land. Additionally, the benefits of bringing trade from Aelantir over to Cannor are not lost on us.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A12_colonial_endralliande_tooltip</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is this nation</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_endralliande</li></ul><li>num of cities is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "colonial_enthusiasm" for 25 years</li> | [Anbenncóst Trade](#A12_anbenncost_trade)<br /> |

| <a name="A12_light_ships">Trade Ships</a><br />*The position as top trade power of the Damescrown is a heavily contested one.

| <a name="A12_trade_league">Form a Trade League</a><br />*A popular practice among the merchant republics in the Damescrown is forming a league of smaller countries of mutual defense and trade cooperation.

| <a name="A12_anbenncost_trade">Anbenncóst Trade</a><br />*A major source of goods entering the Damescrown is ships entering from the south, passing by Anbenncóst. Direct control of this trade won't be possible without conquering too far away, but methods such as trade ships, and expanding our newly formed trade league will give us greater influence on the goods entering the Damesneck.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is Beepeck</li><li>share is at least 15</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 3</li><li>country gets the modifier "beepeck_anbenncost_value" for 25 years</li> | [Form a Trade League](#A12_trade_league)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_viswall_trade">Small Country Trade</a><br />*Beepeck's position as the primary route for traders from the Small Country to reach the Dameshead is very valuable.

| <a name="A12_utilize_the_estuary">Utilize the Estuary</a><br />*The Widderoy estuary flowing through the Saltmarshes is key to Beepeck's position as controller of the trade from the Small Country. By constructing markets along the river we will use this to its full advantage.* | <li>60:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>155:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 3</li><li>country gets the modifier "beepeck_new_market" for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A12_honey_bacon">Honey Bacon</a><br />*The halflings of the Strip have been farming pigs to supply Beepeck with food for ages now, and the Saltmarshes have always been valuable for the preservation of food. Some methods of preservation have a value beyond just lasting longer though. Salt-curing strips of pork creates a delicious food. Greater production from the Strip allows more to be brought to Beepeck, and for experiments in new tastes. Honey glazed bacon will be a brand new delicacy, attracting traders to Beepeck over other ports for a chance to try it.* | <li>60:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>205:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>205:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = beepeck_producing_bacon</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>151:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = beepeck_selling_bacon</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "beepeck_new_market" for 20 years</li> | [Utilize the Estuary](#A12_utilize_the_estuary)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_the_honeycomb">The Honeycomb</a><br />*The Honeycomb is the name of the Beepeck City Treasury. Keeping a backup supply of gold is valuable in case of emergency, and can help mitigate inflation.* | <li>treasury is at least 2000</li> | <li>the event [A Treasurer](../events/a_treasurer.md) happens</li><li>country gets the modifier "strong_treasury" for 25 years</li> | [Honey Bacon](#A12_honey_bacon)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_house_stacking">House Stacking</a><br />*Halfling house stacking is a famous architecture technique created in Viswall after the Viswall Rebellion. The partition of the city into two halves, and defined borders eliminated the ability for the city to grow further outwards. So instead they grew their city upwards. It's not literally full houses stacked on top of each other, but rather multi-floor buildings with different houses on each floor. Beepeck's peninsula is getting crowded, so introducing this technique will allow for easier growth.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>151:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = beepeck_house_stacking</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Honeycomb](#A12_the_honeycomb)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_largest_small_city">The Largest Small City</a><br />*Beepeck has held the nickname of Largest Small City for a while now, but in truth, a united Viswall would be significantly bigger. Truly surpassing Viswall as the Biggest Small City in every respect will greatly increase our power and reach.* | <li>151:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 52</li><li>province trade power is at least 120</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "beepeck_merchant" until otherwise removed</li><li>151:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 2</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>If area has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "growth_of_capital"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul></ul> | [House Stacking](#A12_house_stacking)<br /> |
| <a name="A12_settle_newacre">Settle Newacre</a><br />*Newacre is a sparsely populated part of the duchy of Uelaire with a notable halfling population. It's also good farmland that many more halflings would love to settle on. Simply encouraging more halflings to move in will tip the scale from a Uelairey majority to a halfling majority.* | <li>347:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>num of times improved by owner is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "integrating_new_halflings" for 25 years</li><li>347:</li><ul><li>change culture = imperial_halfling</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A12_exwes_mead">Mead Brewery</a><br />*While it was always a possibility, the honey produced from Beepeck has never been used for large scale mead production. This is a missed business opportunity, with the nearest source of mead being all the way in Gerudia. Making it difficult, and therefore expensive to get mead in the Damescrown. With newly available space for our halflings to set up honey farms and mead breweries, we can properly take advantage of this business opportunity.* | <li>156:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>156:</li><ul><li>culture is imperial_halfling</li></ul><li>accepted culture is exwesser</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "beepeck_new_market" for 20 years</li><li>156:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = wine</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = beepeck_halfling_mead</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
