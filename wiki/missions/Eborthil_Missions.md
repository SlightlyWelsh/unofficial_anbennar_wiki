| <a name="eborthil_prepare_busilari_campaign">The Busilari Threat</a><br />*The Busilari and their ruling Silnara have always been our greatest enemy and while we have a superior navy which keeps our islands safe, their army outnumbers ours by a significant margin.

| <a name="eborthil_the_bronze_hill_of_busilar">The Bronze Hill of Busilar</a><br />*The historical capital of Busilar was once one of the few holdouts against gnollish dominion over the region but as the country grew and eventually fell into a civil war, it was forsaken for more fertile lands. If its own people have abandoned it, they certainly wouldn't mind us looting it a bit, right?* | <li>367:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 50</li><li>367:</li><ul><li>add devastation = 50</li><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -3</li><li>add base manpower = -2</li></ul><li>380:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>369:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>35:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 1</li></ul><li>379:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>36:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = eborthil_looting_of_busilar</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has culture is busilari:</li><ul><li>add unrest = 2</li></ul></ul> | [Press Advantage](#eborthil_press_advantage)<br /> |

| <a name="eborthil_the_gnoll_threat">The Gnoll Threat</a><br />*The gnolls are a recent threat in Akan, but that does not mean they are not dangerous. In 1442 a great gnollish invasion swept through most of the region and among the many who perished was the King of Deshak. In their time of desperation they came to us for help and, since then, we have secured their existence. We should continue to foster our bonds for the future of both nations.* | <li>U06:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul> | <li>If akan mountains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If middle akan area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |

| <a name="eborthil_the_final_push">The Final Push</a><br />*We have cleared the lands of the bulk of the gnollish armies but one volatile element remains: Ekha. Rather than stand their ground, they chose to submit to the Viakkoc scourge, allowing them free reign over coast and letting them raid much of southern Cannor. It's time for repayment.* | <li>ekha area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>akarat area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>akan isles area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Submission of Faith](../events/the_submission_of_faith.md) happens</li> | [Akani Liberation](#eborthil_akani_liberation)<br /> |

This will be a bloody affair, but it must be done.* | <li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>treasury is at least 500</li> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>add treasury = -500</li><li>custom tooltip = eborthil_gnolls_purge</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>U06:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is akan region, and  has culture is west sandfang gnoll:</li><ul><li>add devastation = 50</li><li>change culture = desha</li><li>change religion = PREV</li></ul></ul><li>A47:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is akan region, and  has culture is west sandfang gnoll:</li><ul><li>add devastation = 50</li><li>change culture = desha</li><li>change religion = PREV</li></ul></ul></ul> | [The Final Push](#eborthil_the_final_push)<br /> |

| <a name="eborthil_exploit_the_mother">Exploit the Mother</a><br />*As it turns out these mountains have been traditionally held as a holy site for the native populace, which means that so far it had gone largely unexploited.

| <a name="eborthil_islands_of_the_flooded_coast">Islands of the Flooded Coast</a><br />*Off the bay of Flooded Coast can be found some of the most valuable island in the Sea. Gemisle, notorious for it's sapphire mines; and Nathalaire a city which became rich thanks to pirates, slavers and contrabandists. If we seize them their riches could be quite useful for us.* | <li>451:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>452:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier eborthil_profits_from_swamp_islands for 10 years</li> | [Build Up Naval Force](#eborthil_build_up_naval_force)<br /> |
| <a name="eborthil_dealing_with_the_pirates">Dealing with the Pirates</a><br />*As we work towards dismantling most institutions that do no fit our nation and taking much of the confiscated riches to our home, one fact has come to our attention: among the population of Nathalaire many skilled navigators, traders and even artisans can be found! If rather than executing them, we gave them a chance to move to Eborthíl and act legally, this could perhaps turn out to be an economic boom to us. Though the merchant class is unlikely to appreciate new competition.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has estate estate_burghers</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 50</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li></ul> | <li>If has estate is estate burghers:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty = -10</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -200</li></ul><li>451:</li><ul><li>add devastation = 50</li><li>add base tax = -6</li><li>add base production = -6</li><li>add base manpower = -6</li></ul><li>379:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>isle of tef area:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul> | [Islands of the Flooded Coast](#eborthil_islands_of_the_flooded_coast)<br /> |
| <a name="eborthil_the_banks_and_the_arts">The Banks and the Arts</a><br />*Unlike most of the continent, Eborthíl possesses a significant number of human noble houses that have become wealthy through banking. They are often locked in societal clash with the mercantile class, with both sides spending lavish amounts of wealth in funding projects of all kinds, from paintings to fashion and architecture. This indirectly has led to a rich cultural expression inside of Eborthíl.* | <li>is institution enabled is renaissance</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has institution renaissance</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li></ul> | <li>If does not have institution is renaissance:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>isle of tef area:</li><ul><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = renaissance</li><li>value = 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>380:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eborthil_banks_invest_in_the_arts</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Dealing with the Pirates](#eborthil_dealing_with_the_pirates)<br /> |
| <a name="eborthil_invest_in_a_trade_fleet">Invest in a Trade Fleet</a><br />*With the pirates of Nathalaire dealt with, the eastern Divenhal has become significantly safer, so much so that it would probably be worth it for us to help finance more merchant adventures.* | <li>num of light ship is at least 20</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eborthil_trade_fleet for 50 years</li> | [The Banks and the Arts](#eborthil_the_banks_and_the_arts)<br /> |
| <a name="eborthil_rein_in_the_banks">Rein in the Banks</a><br />*An immense portion of the wealth that can be found in Eborthíl is in the hand of the banks, typically owned by nobility. While they tend to positively impact our economy, we could benefit from a more direct interference from governmental authorities, the bank owners however will not be too happy about it.* | <li>379:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>isle of tef area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eborthil_centralized_investments</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = 200</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty = -15</li></ul> | [Invest in a Trade Fleet](#eborthil_invest_in_a_trade_fleet)<br />[Naval Saboteurs](#eborthil_naval_saboteurs)<br /> |
