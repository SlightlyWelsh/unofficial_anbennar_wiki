| <a name="elchos_legacy_of_goldtree_rebellion">Legacy of the Goldtree</a><br />*With the heroic leadership of the young Manaron Goldtree, Elchos broke free from the repressive regime of Arakeprun in 1435. Gathering support from the frustrated nobles of the realm and from Pelomar, Manaron fought the clergy of Arakeprun to break free of theocratic control and assert leadership of the nobility. It has been four years since this war, and with every passing year Arakeprun has recovered its strength, lead by the powerful mage Filnar Dawnfire after their humiliating defeat. Elchos must be ready to defend its sovereignty if we are to hold off the clergy.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 1</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.8</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type army_organiser</li><li>advisor  is army_reformer</li><li>advisor   is commandant</li><li>advisor    is grand_captain</li><li>advisor     is recruitmaster</li><li>advisor      is fortification_expert</li><li>advisor       is quartermaster</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "elchos_legacy_of_goldtree" for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="elchos_elchosi_war_of_supremacy">Liberation of Arakeprun</a><br />*During the Goldtree rebellion, Manaron sought to overthrow the theocracy of Arakeprun. Crossing north of the Arrag river into Darhan was a disastrous campaign, as the Elchosi and Pelomaran armies were driven back by resistance lead by Filnar Dawnfire. We must follow through and accomplish Manaron Goldtree's mission and defeat the Arakepruni theocracy!* | <li>2008:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Arakeprun</li></ul> | <li>2007:</li><ul><li>add core = ROOT</li></ul><li>2007:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -1</li><li>add base production = -1</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li></ul><li>add years of income = 2</li><li>2008:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty = 15</li></ul><li>add estate influence modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>influence = 10</li></ul><li>reduce estate church loyalty effect = yes</li><li>add estate influence modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_church</li><li>influence = -10</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier "elchos_reign_goldtree" for 25 years</li> | [Legacy of the Goldtree](#elchos_legacy_of_goldtree_rebellion)<br /> |
