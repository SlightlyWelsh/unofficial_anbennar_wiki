| <a name="orlghelovar_recruit_great_minds">Recruit Great Minds</a><br />*While we have managed to refound Orlghelovar, we are now facing a new issue: surface-dwarves from across Halann are reluctant to join our new hold, and we have a lack of forward-thinking people. Extensive planning is needed for us to become a major power in and beyond the Serpentreach, and for that, we need the sharpest dwarven minds we can get. If they are not coming of their own volition, we must pay to hire them directly.* | <li>has mil advisor 2 yes</li><li>has adm advisor 2 yes</li><li>has dip advisor 2 yes</li> | <li>country gets the modifier orlghelovar_early_growth for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="orlghelovar_expand_production">Expand Production</a><br />*With the natural resources, old equipment, and strategic position of Orlghelovar we have elected to follow the steps of our predecessors by focusing on the manufacture and trade of glass. At present, we are little more than a pioneer settlement in the Serpentreach; if we are to establish a commercial empire, the first step would be to increase our manufacturing base. * | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If random owned province has building is workshop:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>If random owned province has building is workshop:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>If random owned province has building is workshop:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>If random owned province has building is workshop:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul><li>If random owned province has building is workshop:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li></ul> | [Recruit Great Minds](#orlghelovar_recruit_great_minds)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_not_so_britle_anymore">Not so Brittle Anymore</a><br />*Our position as a surface hold is advantageous, giving us easy access to lucrative surface trade routes. But our vulnerability to outside invasions makes our beautiful new hold as fragile as a fine crystal goblet. We must fortify Orlghelovar to ensure only commerce, not foreign invaders, may pass through our gates.* | <li>4238:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>development is at least 40</li><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = fortification_expert</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = cobalt_dwarf</li><li>religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [Expand Production](#orlghelovar_expand_production)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_restore_the_glassworks">Restore the Glassworks</a><br />*With our domestic economy flourishing and our new hold secured, we can finally focus on our speciality: glassmaking. In the days of Aul-Dwarov, Orlghelovar was known far and wide for its great wealth, all stemming from the glass trade. We must expand and reclaim the old depths of this hold if we are to start producing a fraction of what our ancestors achieved.* | <li>4238:</li><ul><li>has dwarven hold 3 yes</li></ul> | <li>4238:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_glasslords1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>set province flag [orlghelovar_glass_hold](../flags/orlghelovar_glass_hold.md)</li><li>If does not have trade goods is glass:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = glass</li></ul></ul> | [Not so Brittle Anymore](#orlghelovar_not_so_britle_anymore)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_cobalt_not_only_in_name">Cobalt not only in Name</a><br />*During our reclamations, we discovered the remains of a vast mining operation in the caverns close to the hold, excavating deposits still rich with cobalt ore. This must be the ancient deposit that gave the old dwarven citizens of Orlghelovar their name. Our advisors have recommended restarting mining in these caverns as soon as possible.* | <li>2939:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>2939:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_early_cobalt_mining</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Expand Production](#orlghelovar_expand_production)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_combinations_of_glass">Combinations of Glass</a><br />*Now that we have obtained a supply of the same cobalt ores used by our ancestors, it should be possible to recreate the trademark fine blue glassware of Orlghelovar. Without the right equipment, however, it is proving difficult to reproduce. Perhaps if we can secure a source of diamonds, we can build harder, sharper tools to work the glass with.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 1</li><li>trade goods is glass</li><li>base production is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>the event [Cobalt Glass](../events/cobalt_glass.md) happens</li> | [Cobalt not only in Name](#orlghelovar_cobalt_not_only_in_name)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_crystal_experts">Crystal Experts</a><br />*Old maps indicate that Arg-Ôrdstun is close by. It is a hold known for its defiance against Aul-Dwarov and its gigantic mines. Reclaiming it in our name would be a prestigious act and would also give us access to new possibilities within the Serpentreach.* | <li>4093:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>If shazstundihr area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4093:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="orlghelovar_marble_experts">Marble Experts</a><br />*South of Orlghelovar lies another abandoned hold: Shazstundihr, once famous for its stunning marble architecture. While these architectural techniques are likely lost to time, reclaiming the hold itself would solidify our control of the western regions of Serpentreach and give our merchants easier access into northern Bulwar.* | <li>2942:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add dip power = 50</li> | [Crystal Experts](#orlghelovar_crystal_experts)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_stabilze_our_reign">Stabilize our Reign</a><br />*To our surprise, Arg-Ôrdstun still lives! The stubborn diamond dwarves defied the greentide just as they once defied the authority of Aul-Dwarov. Decades of isolation deep within the Serpentreach, however, have left the once grand hold in a decrepit state. We may be able to use this to our advantage: if we can show our generous support in rebuilding their home, they may be grateful enough to accept our reign over them.* | <li>4093:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>development is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add adm power = 50</li> | [Marble Experts](#orlghelovar_marble_experts)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_new_trading_partners">New Trading Partners</a><br />*With Shazstundhir and Arg-Ôrdstun secured and reclaimed, we can now begin looking outside the Serpentreach to the trading partners of old Orlghelovar. Fine cobalt-blue Orlghelovaric glass can still be seen in many old palaces and temples in Bulwar, but the kingdoms that once purchased our glass to build these structures are now long-gone. Today, Bulwar is a fractured mess of human-elven infighting. We should avoid involving ourselves with the politics of the region, and instead establish friendly trade with both sides, to ensure we may continue to profit.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>has country modifier human_administration</li></ul></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>has country modifier human_administration</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is vassal</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 80</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>has country modifier elven_administration</li></ul></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>has country modifier elven_administration</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is vassal</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 80</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>1312:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 25</li><li>key = ORLGHELOVAR_TRADE_AGREEMENTS</li></ul></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = trader</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = bahari</li><li>religion = bulwari_sun_cult</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = orlghelovar_bulwar_discovery_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every known country has capital scope has superregion is bulwar superregion:</li><ul><li>4238:</li><ul><li>discover country = PREV</li></ul><li>2942:</li><ul><li>discover country = PREV</li></ul></ul><li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>1312:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Stabilize our Reign](#orlghelovar_stabilze_our_reign)<br />[Reclaiming our Name](#orlghelovar_reclaiming_our_name)<br />[First Steps](#orlghelovar_first_steps)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_first_steps">First Steps</a><br />*With the reclamation of Shazstundhir complete, we have secured a western gateway from the Serpentspine directly into Bulwar. We should begin building up our own trade posts close to the existing Bahari ports and land routes, to begin profiting from our access to this new market.* | <li>2942:</li><ul><li>has building marketplace</li><li>development is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier orlghelovar_first_steps for 25 years</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = diplomat</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = cobalt_dwarf</li><li>religion = ancestor_worship</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>bahar region:</li><ul><li>discover country = I12</li></ul> | [Marble Experts](#orlghelovar_marble_experts)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_impress_bulwar_thinkers">Impress Bulwar</a><br />*Although constantly embroiled in war and religious instability, Bulwar is rich with opportunity. Conflicts can forge brilliant minds, and some Bulwari elves have lived long enough to gather truly impressive amounts of knowledge. Now our traders are established in Bulwar, we can make connections with some of these figures, and perhaps impress them enough to gain their support.* | <li>has estate privilege estate_burghers_patronage_of_the_arts</li><li>prestige is at least 50</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>the event [Old Bulwar Glass](../events/old_bulwar_glass.md) happens</li> | [First Steps](#orlghelovar_first_steps)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_reclaiming_our_name">Reclaiming our Name</a><br />*Our reclamation efforts are increasing in pace, and we have already come far from our humble beginnings as an adventurer band wandering the abandoned tunnels of the Serpentreach. Our new home is growing by the day, and we need more space for our new citizens, and a proper military to protect us from the dangers still lurking in the dark.* | <li>num of provinces in states is at least 15</li><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier orlghelovar_reclaiming_our_name for 20 years</li><li>add treasury = 150</li> |  |
| <a name="orlghelovar_resurgence_of_a_legacy">Resurgence of a Legacy</a><br />*Through our great efforts, we have succeeded in drawing dwarves across Halann to build a new nation in the Serpentreach. Our hold has been secured, our glassworks have been established, and our merchants have begun trade with the cities of Bulwar. The opening chapter of our nation’s story has ended, but Orlghelovar has only just begun!* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier racial_pop_goblin_purge</li><li>has country modifier  racial_pop_goblin_expulsion</li></ul><li>any ally:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier goblin_administration</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Open the Outside Markets](../events/open_the_outside_markets.md) happens</li> | [Combinations of Glass](#orlghelovar_combinations_of_glass)<br />[Restore the Glassworks](#orlghelovar_restore_the_glassworks)<br />[New Trading Partners](#orlghelovar_new_trading_partners)<br />[Impress Bulwar](#orlghelovar_impress_bulwar_thinkers)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_diamonds_and_glass">Diamonds and Glass</a><br />*The hardness of glass makes it difficult to work with. We may have mastered the craft of glassmaking, but that does not mean we should stop searching for new methods and tools. Diamonds are harder than glass, and might be the key to developing better tools for cutting and engraving our wares. Perhaps the dwarves in Arg-Ôrdstun can assist us?* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 1000</li></ul><li>4093:</li><ul><li>development is at least 50</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Dharma"</li></ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Dharma":</li><ul><li>add treasury = -1000</li></ul><li>the event [Diamond Tools](../events/diamond_tools.md) happens</li> | [Resurgence of a Legacy](#orlghelovar_resurgence_of_a_legacy)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_increase_demand_for_diamonds">Diamond Demand</a><br />*While glass may be our main trade, we should not neglect the manufacturing of other goods. Our recently developed diamond cutting tools are useful, but frustratingly low in supply. The diamond mines near Arg-Ôrdstun are not producing enough raw materials to meet our demands, and so we must increase our diamond-mining efforts to meet the needs of our glassworkers!* | <li>2950:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>2948:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>2947:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>2950:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_incentivised_strip_mining</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2948:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_incentivised_strip_mining</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2947:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_incentivised_strip_mining</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Diamonds and Glass](#orlghelovar_diamonds_and_glass)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_diamond_quarry">The Diamond Quarry</a><br />*The Diamond Quarry is, as its name suggests, famous for its vast, seemingly never-ending deposits of diamonds. Since our adoption of diamond tools, demand for these gems has increased quite significantly. We should invest in the quarry and expand it to prevent shortages.* | <li>2948:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 450</li> | <li>2948:</li><ul><li>If does not have trade goods is gold, and does not have trade goods is mithril:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li><li>add building = mills</li></ul><li>Else if has trade goods is gold:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_golden_diamond_quarry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has trade goods is mithril:</li><ul><li>add building = weapons</li></ul></ul><li>add treasury = -450</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Rumors of a Volcano](../events/rumors_of_a_volcano.md) happens</li></ul> | [Diamond Demand](#orlghelovar_increase_demand_for_diamonds)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_integrate_baharkandis_ways">Integrate Baharkandi</a><br />*Right outside Shazstundihr’s gates lies the realm of Baharkand. This region was once known as the ‘Gulf of Glass’, both for its dazzling beauty and its glassmaking industry, although following the recent Goblin invasions it is a little worse for wear. The glass workshops here owe their beginnings to techniques developed by our own Orlghelovaric ancestors, and while we are happy to see the legacy of our forebears  still alive and well, they now represent serious commercial rivals for our hold. We must take control of the region’s production if we want to dominate the Bulwari glass market* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>base production is at least 12</li><li>trade goods is glass</li><li>region is bahar_region</li></ul><li>1312:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 60</li></ul></ul> | <li>536:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_baharkandi_glass_trade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>530:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = orlghelovar_baharkandi_glass_trade</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = "orlghelovar_glasslords_upgrade_tt"</li><li>orlghelovar glasslords upgrade = yes</li> | [Resurgence of a Legacy](#orlghelovar_resurgence_of_a_legacy)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_make_partners_depended">Make Partners Dependant</a><br />*The dwarves of Ovdal Túngir have proven themselves reliable and very trusting trade partners. Our merchant spies have so much access to information on the Túngeric government and economy that we have been able to identify the major firms underpinning their state. With enough funds, we could purchase these firms and make Ovdal Túngir financially dependent on our own economy, a client state in all but name.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Ovdal Tungr</li></ul><li>has spy network in:</li><ul><li>Ovdal Tungr</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 2500</li></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Ovdal Tungr</li><li>is vassal</li></ul><li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>magairous area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>medbahar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>tungr mountains area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has F23 has exists, and F23 is not vassal:</li><ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = vassal</li><li>subject = F23</li></ul><li>add treasury = -2500</li><li>If bahar region does not have core is F23; and does not have owned by is F23:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = F23</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If bahar region does not have core is I12; and does not have owned by is I12:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = I12</li></ul></ul> | [Integrate Baharkandi](#orlghelovar_integrate_baharkandis_ways)<br />[Trading Knowledge](#orlghelovar_with_trade_comes_knowledge)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_warding_gate">The Warding Gate</a><br />*The hold of Verkal Skomdihr was once well-known both for their mystical crafts and their key geographical location, bordering a dense forest full of capricious and devious Fey spirits. The enchanted Warding Gate of the hold once prevented the incursion of the Fey or their magic into Aul-Dwarov, but since the fall of Verkal Skomdihr, we fear the gate is wrongly maintained, or has failed completely. Even if the knowledge needed to restore the gate is already lost, we should take control of the hold and secure this point of access into the Serpentreach.* | <li>4100:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>hold condition:</li><ul><li>Repaired is yes</li></ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 75</li><li>add mil power = 75</li> | [Three Hold Consolidation](#orlghelovar_three_hold_consolidation)<br /> |

We have heard word of elven nations within the forest who are fighting against orcs and goblins, just like we have! We should establish diplomatic relations with one of these elf-realms. Perhaps we can lend a hand, and come to a mutually profitable arrangement?* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is deepwoods_superregion</li></ul><li>primary culture is wood_elf</li></ul></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is deepwoods_superregion</li></ul><li>primary culture is wood_elf</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>num of allies is at least 4</li></ul> | <li>If has any known country has primary culture is wood elf:</li><ul><li>If random known country has primary culture is wood elf, and  has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 100:</li><ul><li>the event [Orlghelovar Sends an Expedition](../events/orlghelovar_sends_an_expedition.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul> | [The Warding Gate](#orlghelovar_warding_gate)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_gain_new_partners">Gain New Partners</a><br />*Now that we have secured our diplomatic relations with surface nations, we can begin looking for allies within the Serpentspine. We are not the only dwarves under these mountains: other pioneering adventurer bands and remnant holds that survived the fall control some caverns and isolated holds. All present opportunities for beneficial partnerships that might strengthen our position within and beyond Serpentreach.* | <li>any ally:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>primary culture is wood_elf</li></ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>modifier is sent_gift</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier orlghelovar_dwarven_caravan until otherwise removed</li> | [An Unexplored Wilderness](#orlghelovar_unexplored_wilderness)<br /> |
| <a name="orlghelovar_with_trade_comes_knowledge">Trading Knowledge</a><br />*When we asked ourselves what we could do to impress the gnomes, we came to the conclusion to impress them through innovations and a strong state. But how could we create such a state in the first place? Cobalt Dwarves all over Orlghelovar argued about that and after a considerable amount of time a solution was found. The Glasshammer fair shows innovations in glassmaking from all over the world. So if we would use our vast network of trading partners and traders all over Cannor and Bulwar, we could use specialists as spies. For that we need to elevate merchants all over Orlghelovar into high ranks to encourage a beneficial position for our state and for them and ensure their loyalty to us.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 80</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_burghers_commercial_board_of_advice</li><li>has estate privilege  estate_burghers_exclusive_trade_rights</li> | <li>set country flag [orlghelovar_merchant_spies](../flags/orlghelovar_merchant_spies.md)</li><li>set estate privilege = estate_burghers_merchant_spies</li> | [Gain New Partners](#orlghelovar_gain_new_partners)<br />[Normal sized Geniuses](#orlghelovar_normal_sized_geniuses)<br /> |

| <a name="orlghelovar_taking_revenge">Taking Revenge</a><br />*Dwarves are well-known for holding grudges, and we will always hold a special place of hatred in our hearts for the ruin the orcs and goblins wrought on our people. The grasslands of Ourdia on the doorstep of our hold are infested with goblins, and it will be a pleasure to pay the goblins back in kind. Establishing safe routes for surface trade is, of course, an important secondary concern.* | <li>east overmarch area:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul><li>west overmarch area:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is goblin</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If ourdia region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Resurgence of a Legacy](#orlghelovar_resurgence_of_a_legacy)<br /> |

Thankfully we have obtained the secrets of ‘black damestear’, or Korrashi, which can neutralize magical explosions. This material is invaluable for constructing the machine, and isolating certain components which should not interact with one another. However, the amount we are using is placing a heavy toll on our Korrashi production facility. We will need to expand our production and our understanding of Korrashi if this device is to become a reality.* | <li>2942:</li><ul><li>development is at least 90</li><li>has building university</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>4238:</li><ul><li>is prosperous</li><li>has multiple manufactory trigger:</li><ul><li>VAL is at least 2</li></ul><li>has dwarven hold 9 yes</li></ul> | <li>the event [Black Box](../events/black_box.md) happens</li> | [Leap into the Future](#orlghelovar_leap_into_future)<br /> |

The hold of Mithradhûm, in the Western Serpentspine, was well-renowned for its supplies of mithril ore and equipment. We should seek out this city, not only for its natural resources but also for its technical knowledge of mithril-working.

We would need to modernize our army, as otherwise it would only make sense to outfit our most elite troops in this armor. Still, we can begin mass-production immediately: rendering even a handful of our best soldiers bulletproof could make all the difference in battle.* | <li>2973:</li><ul><li>development is at least 70</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has forcelimit building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = orlghelovar_shatterproof_armor_tt</li><li>set country flag [orlghelovar_shatterproof_armor](../flags/orlghelovar_shatterproof_armor.md)</li><li>set country flag [orlghelovar_armour_protection_done](../flags/orlghelovar_armour_protection_done.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = orlghelovar_finished_research_arc_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Future of Science](../events/the_future_of_science.md) happens</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has country flag is [orlghelovar_magical_bullets_research_done](../flags/orlghelovar_magical_bullets_research_done.md):</li><ul><li>the event [Army Reform](../events/army_reform.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [Apprentice's Thought](#orlghelovar_apprentices_thought)<br /> |
