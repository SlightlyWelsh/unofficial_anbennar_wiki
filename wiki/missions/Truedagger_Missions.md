The courtiers' partial control of the Shadow Daggers, in particular, is putting us in a difficult position. We must curtail their influence and ensure their loyalty, to re-establish complete control over our elite spies and assassins.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_artificers</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>influence is at least 70</li></ul></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_church</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_burghers</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_artificers</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country flag [banned_magic](../flags/banned_magic.md)</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 40</li></ul></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_nobles_courtiers_shadow_daggers</li> | <li>country gets the modifier truedagger_eternal_service until otherwise removed</li> | [Find Their Homes](#H85_find_their_homes)<br /> |

| <a name="H85_the_goblin_village">The Goblin Village</a><br />* In the capital of the conquered ogres of the Serpent's Vale, we found something peculiar: a village of goblins, living in coexistence with the giantkin. While their relationship with the Mire Maw clan was mostly benign, they were still forced to adapt to living outside of the safety of the Serpentspine.\n\nMany of them resorted to the cloak-and-dagger - some could even best our most skilled assassins!

| <a name="H85_new_operations">New Operations</a><br />*The Shadow Daggers performed admirably when taking Er-Natvir, but there is always more to be done. Perhaps their next target should be more... personal.\n\n A hostile ruler, maybe?
