| <a name="azkare_gather_advisors">Gather Advisors</a><br />*Hiderion was born to a small family of elven farmers in Azkare 75 years ago. Ever since reaching  adulthood (by human standards) he has served the Prakuong family, as both a valued advisor and personal retainer. He has risen through the ranks through dedication and skill, eventually being adopted and earning the name Hiderion Tonanzuir.\n\nHis journey from peasant to Lord inspires many in our township, and the locals are eager to show their aptitude and become advisors to Hiderion. We must gather these men and women and use them to improve our court.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is ADM</li><li>culture is sikai</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is DIP</li><li>culture is sikai</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is MIL</li><li>culture is sikai</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Sons of Azkare](../events/sons_of_azkare.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="azkare_tour_the_towns">Tour the Towns</a><br />*When the people of Azkare elected Hiderion they did so based on a promise of glory and prosperity, and that is what Hiderion gave them. In 1441 he started a campaign of expansion against the neighbouring states of Lo Ngoen and Khao Elnak. The decisive blow came at the battle of Lektonmai, in which both leaders of Khao Elnak and Lo Ngoen were slain during a charge of the Shining Lancers, after which Hiderion was able to quadruple the size of Azkare.\n\nHowever, the newly conquered towns do not trust Hiderion: the fear that Jaher left behind is still strong in much of Haless, and people are wary of elves. He will personally tour the newly annexed towns, and make sure that their loyalty does not falter.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>the event [Touring the New Towns](../events/touring_the_new_towns.md) happens</li> | [Gather Advisors](#azkare_gather_advisors)<br /> |
| <a name="azkare_hiderions_contemplation">Hiderion's Contemplation</a><br />*His name has already grown both within and outside of Azkare, but surely there is more to be done?\n\nHiderion has seen three human generations come and go in his time here, while he himself would still be considered an adolescent had he lived in Bulwar. There is so much to achieve; It is time to contemplate our ambitions and where they will take us.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>country gets the modifier azkare_modifier_hiderions_contemplation_modifier for 3 years</li><li>add treasury = -50</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>the event [Hiderion's Contemplation](../events/hiderion_s_contemplation.md) happens</li> | [Tour the Towns](#azkare_tour_the_towns)<br /> |

| <a name="azkare_integrate_new_towns">Integrate New Towns</a><br />*After the battle of Lektonmai in 1441, Azkare annexed many new towns. While taxes have come in steadily, they are less than we expected and not nearly enough recruits are joining our ever-growing army.\n\nWe will give them a chance to join the Shining Lancers, our prestigious core of heavy shock cavalry, a legacy of the Phoenix Legions. This both gains their loyalty as well as preparing for further expansion of Azkare.* | <li>is year is at least 1446</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>the event [New Recruits](../events/new_recruits.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="azkare_conquer_khao_elnak">Conquer Khao Elnak</a><br />*The township of Khao Elnak is still in disarray after our victory in 1441. They elected Lady Mya Saetae to be their leader, the daughter of a strong Dauloph in Lot Dekkhang, who according to some has ties all across the continent.\n\nWe should eliminate this threat before it grows into something bigger. Not only that, Khao Elnak is home to the Sikai Purebred, the fastest breed of horse in all of Thidinkai, and a perfect addition to our Shining Lancers.* | <li>phakphon area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>kaiden area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li> | [Integrate New Towns](#azkare_integrate_new_towns)<br /> |

Hiderion saw something truly great in Mya during the peace negotiations, and the lord has been increasingly absent  from court...* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Khao Elnak</li></ul><li>owns core province 4792</li><li>owns core province  4788</li><li>owns core province   4791</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>num of mercenaries is at least 4</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>the event [The Lady Mya Saetae](../events/the_lady_mya_saetae.md) happens</li> | [Conquer Khao Elnak](#azkare_conquer_khao_elnak)<br /> |

| <a name="azkare_towards_the_future">Towards the Future</a><br />*Three years ago, on the fields near Lektonmai, the Shining Lancers earned a decisive victory with a glorious charge, and set Azkare on a new path towards a new destiny. If we want to exploit and repeat this success, we need a mighty army. The Shining Lancers must be drilled into perfection, and the units that support them expanded.* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li><li>4789:</li><ul><li>cavalry in province is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>ngoen area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="azkare_finish_lo_ngoen">Finish Lo Ngoen</a><br />*Lo Ngoen is the township to our northeast, smaller than Azkare but rich despite it. It is upstream on the Telebei, with easy access to trade from the dwarves of Verkal Ozovar and the Hinphat. The lords of Ngoen also control a significant gold mine -- all of these will be better used under Hiderion’s oversight.* | <li>ngoen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li> | [Towards the Future](#azkare_towards_the_future)<br /> |
| <a name="azkare_the_lord">The Lord</a><br />*The Lord Rama Buakae was leader of Lo Ngoen until we conquered them, while most other Lords would have executed him to ensure they would not rise up in the future, Hiderion knows better. Rama will be recruited to serve as a loyal advisor of Hiderion, and will lead our armies to further conquests.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y60</li></ul><li>owns core province 4777</li><li>owns core province  4940</li><li>owns core province   4781</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_nobles_right_of_counsel</li><li>has estate privilege  estate_nobles_advisors</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -50</li><li>the event [The Lord Rama Buakae](../events/the_lord_rama_buakae.md) happens</li> | [Finish Lo Ngoen](#azkare_finish_lo_ngoen)<br /> |
| <a name="azkare_guardian_of_the_townships">Guardian of the Townships</a><br />*The first steps of Hiderion’s vision have been fulfilled. The foundations have been laid for the oncoming centuries, and greatness will be built upon them -- The townships, for the first time since Harimar, stand united under one ruler.\n\nHiderion has shown himself not to be just another warlord, but a ruler that truly cares about the wellbeing and unity of his people. Were it not for him, these townships would still have been squabbling statelets, too busy with their own conflicts to see the greater picture. Not just the Sikai, but all of Haless needs the guidance of the elves, and it is Hiderion that will enlighten them.* | <li>ngoen area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>kaiden area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>phakphon area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>thirabnir area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier azkare_modifier_guardian_of_the_townships for 10 years</li><li>the event [Further Ambitions](../events/further_ambitions.md) happens</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>azkare parliament setup = yes</li></ul><li>add government reform = azkare_court</li> | [Hiderion's Contemplation](#azkare_hiderions_contemplation)<br />[The Lord](#azkare_the_lord)<br />[The Lady](#azkare_the_lady)<br />[The Brothers](#azkare_the_brothers)<br />[A Flourishing Economy](#azkare_a_flourishing_economy)<br /> |

| <a name="azkare_visiting_an_old_friend">Visiting an Old Friend</a><br />*Lord Narai Chaiya of Thirabnir grew up with Hiderion, both serving the Lord Tonan Prakuong as retainers in their youth and having kept in contact ever since and they remain as close friends. And while Hiderion’s life has only just begun, Narai’s life nears its end.\n\nWe will pay our friend one last visit, and pay our dues.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Y59:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Y86</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Y86</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y59</li></ul></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>Y59:</li><ul><li>the event [The Death of Lord Narai Chaiya](../events/the_death_of_lord_narai_chaiya.md) happens</li></ul> |  |

After much convincing and after some long evening talks with the brothers, they have seen the light of Hiderion’s vision, and have decided to join us in our cause. They see beyond the townships, and will assist us however they can in a new, bright future of Haless.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Y59:</li><ul><li>is subject of is Y86</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y59</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier azkare_modifier_a_dream_shared for 20 years</li> | [Visiting an Old Friend](#azkare_visiting_an_old_friend)<br /> |
| <a name="azkare_the_brothers">The Brothers</a><br />*The Chaiya Brothers, much like their grandfather, are unequivocally skilled in their respective fields. Sevinay has become a brilliant orator, touring the countryside of our and neighbouring realms, and spreading the word of Hiderion’s vision. Kiyokat has proven to be a skilled field commander and has quickly risen through the ranks of the Shining Lancers becoming its general.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Y59</li></ul><li>thirabnir area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>the event [The Brothers Chaiya](../events/the_brothers_chaiya.md) happens</li> | [A Shared Dream](#azkare_a_shared_dream)<br /> |

| <a name="azkare_khanvuphaim_industry">Khanvuphaim Industry</a><br />*is the name of a fabric made exclusively in Azkare from the feathers of a rare breed of bird found in the jungles of Thidinkai. Weaving them together without damage takes centuries to learn, but with the proper technique it becomes strong as steel yet as light as silk.\n\nThere are only a few elven masters which have mastered this craft and remain dedicated to it, yet our demand for it is much greater than the supply. We will encourage the old masters to take apprentices, and to write down their wealth of knowledge, so that future generations may continue this century old craft.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is natural_scientist</li></ul></ul><li>4789:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4789:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -50</li><li>4789:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azkare_modifier_khanvuphaim_industry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="azkare_sikai_purebreds">Sikai Purebreds</a><br />*The Sikai Purebred is a breed of horse originating in the township of Khao Elnak, and is famed for its speed and tenacity. These steeds would be perfect for our Shining Lancers.\n\nWhile previously a closely guarded breed, with our conquest of Khao Elnak we can expand their pastures and ensure a steady stock of fresh horses to our Lancers.* | <li>owns core province 4790</li><li>4790:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li><li>cavalry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province  4791</li><li>4791:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li><li>cavalry in province is this nation</li></ul><li>owns core province   4792</li><li>4792:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>base manpower is at least 3</li><li>cavalry in province is this nation</li></ul> | <li>4790:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = cavalry</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul><li>4791:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = cavalry</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul><li>4792:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = cavalry</li><li>amount = 1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier azkare_modifier_sikai_purebred until otherwise removed</li> | [Khanvuphaim Industry](#azkare_khanvuphaim_industry)<br /> |

For us, however, It remains a shining beacon of hope, and our capital should reflect our ever-expanding ambitions. Thicken the walls, erect new towers with beautiful gold-plated roofs, and expand the central keep that functions as both our court and bastion!* | <li>4789:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 6</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is azkare_citadel_tooltip</li><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is fortification_expert</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has employed advisor has culture is sunrise elf, and employed advisor has type is fortification expert:</li><ul><li>4789:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = azkare_modifier_citadel_of_dawn_azkare</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azkare_modifier_citadel_of_dawn_azkare_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4789:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = azkare_modifier_citadel_of_dawn_azkare</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = azkare_modifier_citadel_of_dawn_azkare_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [A Flourishing Economy](#azkare_a_flourishing_economy)<br /> |

Many now see the elves as ruthless invaders who do nothing but pillage and plunder, but we Sunrise Elves are a different breed. One that knows compassion, honour, and respect.* | <li>prestige is at least 50</li><li>stability is at least 2</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>corruption is at least 1</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is statesman</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>type is philosopher</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier azkare_modifier_elven_reputation for 20 years</li><li>4789:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add institution embracement:</li><ul><li>which = renaissance</li><li>value = 25</li></ul></ul> | [A Flourishing Economy](#azkare_a_flourishing_economy)<br /> |

The elves who shun those practices have found a place in Lektonmai.\n\nIts lush forests full of game along with a rather empty countryside has made it the perfect place for those who seek some tranquillity, and many have taken up the art of hunting and bowmanship, learned from the Xia masters to the north.* | <li>4787:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 6</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>4787:</li><ul><li>add elven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Elves of Lektonmai](../events/the_elves_of_lektonmai.md) happens</li></ul> | [Sending the Call](#azkare_sending_the_call)<br /> |

The Kelino that dominate their realm see the value in combining the best of several cultures, and they stayed behind in Haless when all the Sun Elves abandoned Haless\n\nThrough diplomacy or war, they will join our growing state.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul><li>diplomatic reputation is at least 3</li><li>Y65:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>full idea group is influence_ideas</li><li>full idea group  is diplomatic_ideas</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>mil power is at least 200</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>adm power is at least 400</li><li>dip power is at least 400</li><li>mil power is at least 400</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li> | <li>the event [Our Southern Brothers](../events/our_southern_brothers.md) happens</li> |  |
