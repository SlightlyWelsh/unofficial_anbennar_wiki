| <a name="A05_prepare_first_kobold_incursion">Prepare Kobold War</a><br />*Our border with the kobolds is a volatile one; diplomacy with these monstrous lizards is implausible.

| <a name="A05_A_New_Capital">A New Capital</a><br />*With Drekiríki firmly in our grasp, it has become even more evident what a true marvel of architecture this stone city is compared to our wooden lodgings in [Root.Capital.GetName]. It is also much more defendable against both the Lencori and the Alenics. Let us drive the kobolds out of the province and resettle it to prepare the city as our new capital.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>177:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has owner culture</li><li>culture group is gnomish</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>177:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [A New capital!](../events/a_new_capital.md) happens</li> | [Reclaim Drekiríki](#A05_Reclaim_Drekiriki)<br /> |

| <a name="A05_develop_the_dragonpoint_countryside">Develop Dragonpoint</a><br />*If the people of Drekiríki are to thrive, there needs to be a steady supply of goods flowing into the city from the surrounding countryside.

| <a name="A05_defending_the_capital">Defending Our Lands</a><br />*We have taken the first steps towards the settling of this land, however people are hesitant to truly invest into our new lands due to fear of foreign conquest. If we want to make the nobility feel safe enough to build estates and the people to feel safe enough to claim land in the rest of the newly acquired areas, we need to build proper defenses in our capital and in Royvibobb and Moorbobb.* | <li>capital is at least 177</li><li>177:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul><li>owns core province 167</li><li>167:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul><li>owns core province  184</li><li>184:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li></ul><li>owns core province   169</li> | <li>add estate loyalty modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>desc = reveria_defended_the_dragon_coast</li><li>loyalty = 10</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul> | [Develop Dragonpoint](#A05_develop_the_dragonpoint_countryside)<br /> |
| <a name="A05_attract_gnomish_industry">Gnomish Industry</a><br />*Before we took this city the Redscales used this great stone city built by the gnomes for fishing, a complete waste of potential according to our Cliff Gnomish advisors. They have drafted plans to repair some industrial buildings which have been gathering dust and kobold feces since the Kobold Rising in 404. The gem processing industry seems particularly promising.

| <a name="A05_grant_artificers_privileges">Satisfy Artificers</a><br />*Recently, not a day goes by that a Cliff Gnome has not appeared before [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] during court hours, asking for more legislation on a certain matter or for less legislation on another. Let us formulate proper legislation to ensure the Artificers both thrive and behave properly in our realm.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_artificers</li><li>loyalty is at least 45</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_artificers</li><li>influence is at least 35</li></ul> | <li>the event [But we don't have Darkvision!](../events/but_we_don_t_have_darkvision.md) happens</li><li>change innovativeness = 1</li> | [Gnomish Industry](#A05_attract_gnomish_industry)<br /> |
| <a name="A05_gnome_mines_secured">Secure the Gnome Mines</a><br />*The time has come for [Root.GetName] to conquer the Kobold Caves and send word to gnomes and dwarves alike to start preparing for a new frontier of mining. We must push the Kobolds to the end of their hovel and then push them some more.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>dragonheights area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>dragondepth area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add years of income = -1</li><li>4646:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li><li>If has trade goods is fungi:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul></ul><li>4645:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li><li>If has trade goods is fungi:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4644:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li><li>If has trade goods is wool:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gems</li></ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>189:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4643:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>185:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li></ul><li>186:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li></ul><li>187:</li><ul><li>change culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change religion = the_thought</li></ul><li>173:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li><li>add base production = 3</li></ul><li>177:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>mission reward artifice points 4 = yes</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_artificers</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul> | [Satisfy Artificers](#A05_grant_artificers_privileges)<br /> |
| <a name="A05_damestear_demands">Damestear Demands</a><br />*The same gnomish interest groups who were proponents of conquering the Kobold Caves are now complaining that the damestear supply cannot meet internal demands and that we must develop the industry of Baycodds or seek more sources of damestear elsewhere. If they say it is of vital economic interest, it probably is, and the mages seem to agree.* | <li>production leader:</li><ul><li>trade goods is damestear</li></ul><li>owns core province 146</li><li>146:</li><ul><li>has building tradecompany</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_artificers</li><li>influence is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>mission reward artifice points 1 = yes</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_artificers</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_mages</li><li>loyalty = 10</li></ul><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = natural_scientist</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = creek_gnome</li><li>religion = regent_court</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> | [Secure the Gnome Mines](#A05_gnome_mines_secured)<br /> |

| <a name="A05_reconquer_the_gnomish_pass">Reconquer Gnomish Pass</a><br />*We have held these lands for centuries, but in 1396 A.A. it was unlawfully wrested from our control by the Cliff Gnomes of Nimscodd who were at the time being assisted by the Gawedis. Now both the Reverian minorities in the region and wise local Cliffs still loyal to the rightful rulers of the Gnomish Pass are being oppressed by the Nimscodd Hierarchy, who wrongly claim to represent all Cliff Gnomes. We should reconquer the Gnomish Pass and show all of gnomekind, but especially those damn Nimscodds that the gnomes are our subjects as well.* | <li>owns core province 145</li><li>owns core province  167</li><li>owns core province   148</li> | <li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>146:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>169:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>126:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If storm isles area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add accepted culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>change innovativeness = 1</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>add manpower = 1.5</li> |  |

It would allow us to rake in taxes and trade, further legitimize our rule over the gnomes and help us defend ourselves against the Lencori.

| <a name="A05_the_thought_tolerance_campaign">Tolerance Campaign</a><br />*With the integration of the Creeks in our realm, it has become painfully obvious that the Cliffs are less accepted than their Portnammer brethren.

They are already drafting new designs, and they look expensive and... incomprehensible.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier gnomish_military</li></ul><li>mil tech is at least 7</li><li>mil power is at least 400</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>169:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is reveria_gnomes_in_the_army1_tt</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is reveria_gnomes_in_the_army2_tt</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is gnomish</li><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>culture is this nation</li><li>has gnomish minority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is reveria_gnomes_in_the_army1_tt</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add mil power = -400</li><li>country gets the modifier "reveria_gnomish_army" until otherwise removed</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = army_reformer</li><li>skill = 2</li><li>culture = cliff_gnome</li><li>religion = the_thought</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_nomsgaetir</li></ul> | [Citizenship for Gnomes](#A05_grant_guild_rights_and_citzenship_to_gnomes)<br /> |

They now stand before [Root.GetRulerTitleAndNameOrRegencyCap] emphasizing the need for them to get out of the stranglehold of Magnate supervision and forced guild fees for privileges not used. They ask to form their own Guild, or Gommo as they call it, The Gommo of Artificers.

It's the largest paper source west of the Dameshead, and, with the onset of the Renaissance, both its demand for paper and its production of paper have increased tenfold.
