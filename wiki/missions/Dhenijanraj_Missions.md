| <a name="R51_subdue_the_south">Subdue the South</a><br />*The Mercantile cities of the Gulf of Rahen have long defied the Lotus Throne. From the time when their alliance slew Ramapalar II at the Bloody Gate of Shenral in 1333, the quarrelling cities of the South have always managed to present a united front against our attempts to subdue them.\n\nThe many indecisive wars we have fought with them in the past century end now - from Davharral to Sardika, the Coast shall kneel to the Raja.* | <li>4367:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>4380:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>avhavubhiya area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>sarkhashabid area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>4369:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>4372:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>2913:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_dockyards_southern_coast for 25 years</li><li>2913:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4380:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>the event [Revenge for the Azure Falcon](../events/revenge_for_the_azure_falcon.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="R51_dockyards_of_southern_rahen">Dockyards of the Coast</a><br />*The Raj has been without a royal navy since the Great Slave Revolt of 1355 AA, when the Tiger Fleet was burned and the harbor of Sramaya was lost to us. Those few ships that sail from the ports of Rabaghekhur and Tujgal will never suffice to challenge the Bhuvauri navy, and so we must build an armada of our own if we are ever to reclaim the Delta.\n\nThe dockyards of the recently conquered southern ports shall be put to work building us mighty warships to dominate the waters of the Gulf of Rahen, and with this new fleet we will end the humiliation of this 100-year slave rebellion.* | <li>naval forcelimit is at least 20</li><li>navy size percentage is at least 0.9</li><li>num of admirals is at least 1</li><li>1350:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 25</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_burgeoning_navy for 25 years</li><li>If dhenbasana estuary area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If kharunyana estuary area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4389:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Subdue the South](#R51_subdue_the_south)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_retake_kharunyana_delta">Retake the Kharunyana</a><br />*Born out of the Great Slave Revolt, the Republic of Bhuvauri is the greatest symbol of the Raj’s impotence - Shurapalar the Radiant could not reconquer the land with deft generalship and pragmatism, nor could Amanapurna I the Bloody subdue it with ruthlessness and slaughter. No, the Slaves-turned-slavers have retained their independence and dominated the Delta for a century, triumphant over our armies an embarrassing number of times - but that embarrassment shall end now. The Raj is no longer weak, and we will prove it once and for all by reclaiming the Kharunyana Delta from the Bhuvauri.* | <li>dhenbasana estuary area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>kharunyana estuary area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>4389:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>4420:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -3</li><li>add base production = -3</li><li>add base manpower = -3</li><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>If li btei area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If reanthung area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lower telebei area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If cmor krueng area does not have permanent claim is ROOT; and does not have core is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Dockyards of the Coast](#R51_dockyards_of_southern_rahen)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_end_bhuvauri_republic">End the Bhuvauri</a><br />*Sramaya, the Pearl of Rahen, is finally ours, and all of the eastern Kharunyana delta has fallen before our conquering armies. Despite the crushing defeat that we have dealt the Bhuvauri, however, we cannot rest upon our laurels. The history of the Harimraj is filled with overconfident leaders brought low by their own complacency, and we may yet be undone if we do not press the advantage.\n\nIt is time to tear down the Bronze Dragon’s Flag - we must cross into Bomdan and end the last remnants of the Republic of Bhuvauri that persist there.* | <li>li btei area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>reanthung area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>lower telebei area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>cmor krueng area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_trade_dominance_kharunyana for 25 years</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_dhenijanraj_sramaya_pearlglaives</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Retake the Kharunyana](#R51_retake_kharunyana_delta)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_expand_raheni_slave_plantations">Expand Slave Plantations</a><br />*Slavery has been an integral part of the economy of southern Rahen for thousands of years. Silk and cotton plantations are worked by prisoners of war, debt slaves, and Sarhali captives alike, their forced labor providing the backbone of these dominant industries.\n\nThe great influx of slaves taken in the Kharunyana campaign has the potential to reinvigorate the southern economy - let us put the Bhuvauri back where they belong, toiling for the glory of the Raja.* | <li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>trade goods is slaves</li><li>has building tradecompany</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>trade goods is spices</li><li>has building tradecompany</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>trade goods is silk</li><li>has building textile</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>trade goods is cotton</li><li>has building plantations</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 2</li><li>country gets the modifier R51_slave_plantations for 25 years</li> | [End the Bhuvauri](#R51_end_bhuvauri_republic)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_raj_cannorian_relations">Cannorian Relations</a><br />*The recent arrival of Cannorian merchants and mercenaries has begun to alter the balance of power in Haless. For centuries, Cannor was little more than a distant dream for most Raheni. Now, however, elven-blooded traders and half-orc mercenaries are a common site in the markets of the East, many of them sponsored by wealthy Cannorian kingdoms.\n\nPerhaps it is time to establish formal relations with the great powers to the West, ensuring that the diplomatic and mercantile treaties that will no doubt be established in the near future are made in our favor.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 125</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_cannor_rahen_contact for 25 years</li> | [Expand Slave Plantations](#R51_expand_raheni_slave_plantations)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_raj_cannorian_armaments">Cannorian Armaments</a><br />*While gunpowder has been known in Haless for centuries, it was seen in Rahen as little more than a dwarven oddity until 16th century advances in metallurgy allowed for cannons to be deployed in large numbers. The Cannorian armies and warships that have come to the shores of the east have brought with them new designs for arquebuses and cannons that improve upon those that we have crafted - studying these weapons will allow us to improve our military technology and ensure we do not fall behind the Cannorians.* | <li>any ally:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>continent is europe</li></ul></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.50</li><li>num of artillery is at least 50</li> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_cannor_mil_tech for 25 years</li> | [Cannorian Relations](#R51_raj_cannorian_relations)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_raj_of_gods_and_gears">Of Gods and Gears</a><br />*Among their many specialties and skills, artifice is the Cannorian expertise that many in the Harimraj find most intriguing. To make magic controlled, repeatable, and accessible to all is a worthy goal, but the Cannorian artificers are overwhelmingly convinced that the High Temples, holiest of holy ground, are the key to the extension of their art.\n\nThey have approached the Lotus Throne repeatedly for permission to lead expeditions into the High Temples, to remove holy relics from their halls for study, and to open doors that were sealed by the High Gods themselves. Such blasphemies cannot be permitted - but perhaps we can allow limited studies of the temples, under our supervision, if these enterprising artificers will share some of their knowledge with us.* | <li>has institution manufactories</li><li>4384:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>base production is at least 4</li><li>has province modifier temple_complex</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>If does not have trade goods is precursor relics:</li><ul><li>4384:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = precursor_relics</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = dhenijanraj_supervised_high_temple_study_tt</li><li>debuff artifice points 2 = yes</li> | [Cannorian Armaments](#R51_raj_cannorian_armaments)<br /> |

| <a name="R51_reign_in_vizier">Reign in Vizier Power</a><br />*The Grand Vizierate of the Harimraj originated during the minority of Shurapalar I the Radiant, when a strong hand was needed to direct the ship of state and prevent the dissolution of the Raj. The man who stepped into this role, Goshar Goldenpaw, guided Rahen for nearly 25 years as prime minister to the Raja.\n\nWhile Goldenpaw worked to stabilize and preserve the Raj, the Viziers who succeeded him became increasingly corrupt and self-serving individuals, and the position has long since become a liability. The independence and ambition of the Vizierate must be crushed, and the Foremost Servant of the Raja reminded that they are still only servants.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is dhenijanraj_reign_vizier_trigger_tt</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>has country flag [raj_vizier](../flags/raj_vizier.md)</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>adm is at least 5</li><li>dip is at least 5</li><li>mil is at least 5</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>liberty desire is at least 20</li></ul></ul></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is vizierSway</li><li>value is at least 25</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_subservient_vizierate for 10 years</li> | [Bloom of the Lotus Court](#R51_bloom_lotus_court)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_authority_lotus_throne">Authority of the Lotus</a><br />*While immediate collapse may have been staved off and the Vizier put back in their place, the Raja is still far from the all-powerful ruler that they are sometimes viewed as by their subjects. Though their most corrupt tendencies have been dealt with, the ministries still hold immense power, many former crownlands have been delegated away to vassals, and the privileges granted to the castes over the past two centuries have chipped away at the supreme authority of the Lotus Throne.\n\nIt is time to begin recentralizing our power and majesty, such that we are not only the master of Rahen in name, but in fact.* | <li>4411:</li><ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is raj_cohesion</li><li>value is at least 95</li></ul></ul><li>crown land share is at least 40</li><li>grown by development is at least 50</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has estate privilege estate_raj_ministries_ceremonial_ruler_act</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_authority_lotus_throne for 25 years</li> | [Reign in Vizier Power](#R51_reign_in_vizier)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_reconstruct_golden_highway">The Golden Highway</a><br />*The Jaherian Epoch is not a period that many Raheni recall with fondness - Sun Elven domination, did not a happy populace make. It is impossible to deny, however, that some of the projects instituted by the Sun Elves improved life in Rahen, and the most visible symbol of their contribution to the subcontinent is the Golden Highway.\n\nRunning from Davharral to Sarisung, the highway is second only to the Kharunyana River as an artery for commerce to flow, but years of neglect have left parts of it in major disrepair. Repairing the highway would not only be good for trade but also solidify the legitimacy and prestige of the Lotus Throne - let us undertake this task.* | <li>golden highway rahen coast:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>golden highway dhujat:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has province modifier golden_highway</li></ul><li>4411:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul><li>4409:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul><li>4391:</li><ul><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_trade_flow for 50 years</li> | [Subdue the South](#R51_subdue_the_south)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_across_far_salahad">Across the Far Salahad</a><br />*The Golden Highway was an ambitious project - a single road that would stretch the breadth of Halcann, from Brasan in the West to Tianlou in the East. To span this distance, the Highway crossed one of the greatest barriers to movement that exists in our world - the Endless Sands of the Far Salahad.\n\nIn doing so, the links between Bulwar and Rahen were strengthened as trade and diplomacy between the regions blossomed. As we look outwards once again, it would be good to remember the many successes of that time and forge new bonds of wealth and knowledge with the Phoenix Akalates of Bulwar.* | <li>2913:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 3</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li></ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 125</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>2901:</li><ul><li>add trade modifier:</li><ul><li>who = ROOT</li><li>duration = -1</li><li>power = 25</li><li>key = STRONG_MERCHANTS</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier R51_connections_west for 50 years</li> | [The Golden Highway](#R51_reconstruct_golden_highway)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_conquer_the_colonies">Conquer the Colonies</a><br />*Over the past centuries, the merchant kingdoms of Iyarashar, Davharral, and Sarkashabid became heavily involved in trading with the Sarhali lands across the Gulf of Rahen. There, they established settlements around their trading posts and drew great wealth in spices and slaves from the colonies established in the shadow of the Empire of Melekafar.\n\nNow that their parent cities have been absorbed into our empire, however, the colonies are defenseless, their wealth ripe for the picking. Let us cross the Gulf of Rahen are reassert Raheni dominance over the far coast.\n\n§RThis mission will be enabled with the release of Sarhal§!* | <li>always</li> |  | [Dockyards of the Coast](#R51_dockyards_of_southern_rahen)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_peridot_king">The Peridot King</a><br />*The Exilarch of Grozumdihr has ruled a kingdom within our kingdom for nearly two thousand years, the entire Peridot Dwarven community turning to his palanquin in Rayavashapal for guidance instead of heeding the words of the Lotus Throne in Dhenijansar. As centralization is cemented in Rahen once more, the existence of an entire people who live their lives outside of the caste system and listen to another authority has become insufferable.\n\nThe dwarves have always been a reasonable people and have long stood side by side with human and harimari, however — perhaps a direct confrontation with the Exilarch can be avoided with diplomacy, and an agreement about our relationship reached?* | <li>has country modifier racial_focus_dwarven</li><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li><li>4435:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>4462:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>4493:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul><li>is prosperous</li></ul> | <li>the event [A Meeting with the Exilarch](../events/a_meeting_with_the_exilarch.md) happens</li><li>4411:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4450:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Banners of the Senaptia](#R51_senaptia_banners)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_dwarves_in_castes">Out-Caste No Longer</a><br />*The Caste System in Rahen is ancient, and stretches back to the dawn of the Nadimraj or before, but the dwarves who call this land their home have never fully integrated into the castes. Despite losing their original homeland and thousands of years of coexistence alongside the system, the dwarven clans have continued to defy the caste conventions that define Raheni society.\n\nWhile such a situation has been acceptable in the past, we have increasingly come to see that a parallel society existing within ours is problematic for royal power. With the Peridot King no longer presenting opposition to our moves, it is time to finally see the Dwarven Clans integrated into the caste system for the sake of broader societal harmony.* | <li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_middlecastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is dhenijanraj_dwarven_integration_tt</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has any dwarven pop trigger yes</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is prosperous</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Out-Caste No Longer](../events/out_caste_no_longer.md) happens</li><li>custom tooltip = dhenijanraj_dwarf_caste_integration_tt</li><li>set country flag [dwarf_in_lowercastes](../flags/dwarf_in_lowercastes.md)</li><li>set country flag [dwarf_in_middlecastes](../flags/dwarf_in_middlecastes.md)</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If has country flag is [blood_lotus_happened](../flags/blood_lotus_happened.md), and  has country flag is human in uppercastes:</li><ul><li>the event [Dwarves request entry to the Upper Castes](../events/dwarves_request_entry_to_the_upper_castes.md) happens</li></ul></ul> | [The Peridot King](#R51_peridot_king)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_temples_of_south">Temples of the South</a><br />*The High Temples are the holiest artifacts of the High Gods, but the inexorable march of the centuries has a way of damaging even that which was wrought by divine will. Where water and wind have not worn away the stones, mortal hands have blasphemed instead, looting these holy places of their treasures or bringing the ruin of fire and war to them.\n\nThough the temples that we have stewarded over the years are of course kept in pristine condition and properly respected, many temples have come under our direct administration over the years. We must repair all of the ravages of time that have come upon the High Temples here in the south, undoing the damage that our internecine struggles have wrought upon them in the years past. * | <li>temple province group:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is rahen_coast_region</li><li>region  is rakhadesh_region</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has province modifier temple_complex</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = dhenijanraj_mission_temples_south_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If temple province group has region is rahen coast region, and has region is rakhadesh region:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = R51_high_temples_south</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [End the Bhuvauri](#R51_end_bhuvauri_republic)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_library_ghundagar">Royal Library of Ghundagar</a><br />*During the first Harimraj, Vinas III the Enlightened founded an innocuous archive of royal records just outside of Sardiphadin. This collection would grow over the years, becoming a vast repository of scrolls of all types. The town that sprang up around the Royal Library at Ghundagar would soon become a major center of learning, the largest in Southern Rahen, and the Rajas the followed Vinas kept their personal collections in Ghundagar.\n\nAlthough civil war destroyed much of the great library in 465 AA, parts of the original structure and collection are still maintained there to this day. We should rebuild this once great center of learning and follow in the footsteps of the Rajas of old, consolidating scholarship around what will again be the greatest library in Rahen.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>has institution printing_press</li><li>4417:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 2</li><li>trade goods is paper</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>base production is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>4417:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = R51_restored_ghundagar_library</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A United Stable Society](#R51_united_stable_society)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_last_fortress_war">The Last Fortress War</a><br />*The great river Kharunyana is the border that separates Rahen from Bomdan, and both sides of this languid watercourse are lined with imposing stone walls and great earthworks. These fortresses have stood in one form or another since the late 600s BA, when a series of conflicts between the Rahenraj and an alliance of Bom kingdoms ended in stalemate after decades of devastation.\n\nSince then, territorial conquest across the River has been rare, with states mostly confined to one bank of the Kharunyana. Having supplanted the Republic of Bhuvauri completely, however, we are in control of the whole of the Kharunyana delta, and have the chance to drive deep into the heart of Bomdan. It is time to tear down the walls of Bomdan, and conclude one final War of the Fortresses.* | <li>bomdan region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_breaker_of_bomdan until otherwise removed</li><li>4560:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4570:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4580:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4600:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>4941:</li><ul><li>add harimari minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Expand Slave Plantations](#R51_expand_raheni_slave_plantations)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_rahenize_bomdan">Rahenization of Bomdan</a><br />*The Claw and Lotus banner flies over every castle and city from Sramaya to Lapnam Amrik, but our control over the jungles and rivers of the east is far from absolute. Though the people of Bomdan are adherents of High Philosophy, it is a land largely unaccustomed to the caste system, Harimari administration, and ministerial regulation that defines Rahen.\n\nEnforcing our laws with force will likely lead only to resentment - but if we ensure that the lives of the Bom who live within the Harimraj are peaceful and prosperous, they will take the changes we make to their daily lives in stride.* | <li>dip power is at least 300</li><li>bomdan region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>has owner religion</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 50</li><li>devastation is at least 1</li><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -300</li><li>country gets the modifier R51_rahenization_of_bomdan until otherwise removed</li> | [The Last Fortress War](#R51_last_fortress_war)<br /> |
| <a name="R51_restore_bim_lau">Restore Bim Lau</a><br />*Chief among the cities of Bomdan is Bim Lau, Temple-City of Spirits and Tombs. In times past, it is said that a garrison of deceased warriors defended Bim Lau’s walls, called forth as spirits from the great Necropolis when the city was in need of protection.

A strict Harimari supremacist, Emperor Manava believed that the bickering and petty lords of Rahen would only remain subservient to the Lotus Throne if they were overawed by its splendor, and so he set out to create a palace that would be a physical symbol of his unimpeachable authority.\n\nThe structure took 76 years to complete, but when Manava’s successors laid the final stone, The Golden Palace was the finest construction built in Haless since the time of the High Gods.

We must invest into our teachers and facilities at the Hall of Examination, renovate ancient structures that have stood since the first Ministries of the Rahenraj, and modernize educational techniques to produce ever-finer graduates for our empire.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>university is at least 10</li><li>4394:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_raj_ministries</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>4394:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = R51_rhamirta_examination_hall</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [A United Stable Society](#R51_united_stable_society)<br /> |

Though Raheni influence along the Yanhe has long ended below the cataracts at Sir, this has not always been the case.\n\nIn the years after the splintering of the first Rahenraj, a great Raheni kingdom ruled the Yanhe from Bianfang to the Jade Hills. Yanhadesh, as it was known, was the greatest of the northern Raheni realms, and its rule lasted until Harimar’s unstoppable march extinguished it in 49 AA.\n\nWhen Harimar’s eastern heirs fell, Yanhadesh was lost as well, and no efforts by the Raheni to reconquer the area ever succeeded. We must end this streak of military setbacks, replicate Harimar’s deeds, and march down the Yanhe, folding the lands of Yanhadesh. back into our ever-expanding empire - for the glory of the past, and the glory of the future.* | <li>upper yanshen region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>mogutian area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>tietyuan area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>4827:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>4901:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier R51_subjugate_yanshen for 25 years</li> | [Free the Jade Mines](#R51_liberate_jade_mines)<br /> |

Unlike Rahen, with its existing Raj Ministries, no such superstructure existed in Yanshen for the administration of the realm. Instead of expanding the caste system, Harimar created a new bureaucracy that would better fit the customs of the Yan - the Eunuch administrators.\n\nIn time the eunuchs would become even more influential than the ministries ever were in Rahen, and after the collapse of the eastern portions of Harimar’s realm, the eunuchs continued to govern what were now independent princedoms. Now that much of Yanshen has been folded back into our realm, the question has been raised concerning how we shall handle the eunuch ministers, and how to fold their administrative expertise into the Raj Ministries. This merger will take time, but gaining so many talented bureaucrats will surely be good for the realm.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_raj_ministries</li><li>loyalty is at least 70</li></ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>superregion is yanshen_superregion</li><li>development is at least 40</li><li>has building university</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>local autonomy is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>set country flag [dhenijanraj_ministry_eunuch_integration](../flags/dhenijanraj_ministry_eunuch_integration.md)</li><li>set estate privilege = estate_raj_ministries_eunuch_integration</li> | [Tiger upon the Yanhe](#R51_tiger_on_yanhe)<br /> |

The family would rise to prominence during the collapse of elven rule in Haless - In the midst of the Jaerelic wars, a headstrong scion of the family named Dhubuvar led a company of adventurers to the aid of the city of Sarnavan, which was in open revolt against its elven governors. Dhubuvar and his adventurer companions joined the resistance, organized the defenders, and liberated the city.\n\nFor these deeds, Dhubuvar was elected king of Sarnavan, and his descendants have ruled the city ever since. In this, they retain the distinction as the more established branch of the Lotus Claw dynasty, even when their cousins claimed the mantle of Harimraja. Union between the two branches of the family has been a long dream of the Harimraj — and with the threat of the hobgoblins looming large in the north, there has never been a better time to absorb Sarnavan.

Since the hobgoblin invasion destroyed Sir and Ghatasak, Rajnadhaga has become the most powerful of the Ruin Kingdoms, and the state most likely to resist the advance of the Command.\n\nThe resources of the kingdom are many - and we must have them if we are to save Rahen from the Northern Menace and unite the Subcontinent under our benevolent rule.

Sir, great bastion of learning and the gateway to Yanshen, barely had time to organize its defence before the dread legions of Moguwon the Black Wolf crashed upon their walls.\n\nSir’s subjugation was a brutal affair that saw any warriors and nobles flee south through the similarly occupied Kingdom of Tilathi.
