| <a name="G93_replenish_scourge_fleet">Replenish Scourge Fleet</a><br />*When Mykx led her people to Aelantir, they were but a fleet fit for raiding the Divenhal Sea.\n\nAs such the fleet suffered a lot and many ships have been decommissioned, scutaged or mothballed since the journey began. It is time to regrow our strength on the seas.* | <li>navy size is at least 30</li> | <li>add navy tradition = 5</li><li>country gets the modifier "reveria_naval_enthusiasm" for 20 years</li> |  |

Trade between our various islands is a vital part of our economy.

| <a name="G93_docks_for_our_ships">A Dock for Our Ships</a><br />*When Mykx took the Scourge Fleet and maneuvered it to Aelantir, we arrived with nothing but our ships, badly damaged by the perilous journey and weeks without repair. \n\nWe lost many ships during those times, we have managed to repair the damage, but our fleet is still in dire need of both reinforcements and a safe haven. Our capital is an obvious location for such a grand dockyard.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>1077:</li><ul><li>has dock building trigger yes</li><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>add navy tradition = 5</li><li>1077:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "mykx_ilzin_dockyard"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |

| <a name="G93_punishments_in_the_pirate_code">Punishment Articles</a><br />*Every port and especially every captain has their own laws. These laws, usually written down as a set of articles, or passed on verbally in smaller communities, differ wildly depending on whose town you're in or what ship you're on.\n\nFor example: Some fearsome captains force those who withhold treasure to walk the plank, whilst others maroon them, others yet give them lashes.\n\nThese discrepancies bring our realm a great degree of chaos, as criminals can lessen their punishment merely by jumping on or off of a ship or fleeing to another island. We must centralize the punishments.* | <li>republican tradition is at least 90</li><li>government reform progress is at least 25</li> | <li>add republican tradition = -10</li><li>change government reform progress = -25</li><li>the event [Punishments In The Pirate Code](../events/punishments_in_the_pirate_code.md) happens</li> |  |

The Kult wishes for the state to allocate funds for such a project, and sees it as a good place to host the majority of the states sacrificial rituals, as it would allow the Kult to keep close oversight and to counter any unwanted side-effects. To this end they wish for a fort to be constructed around the temple, not only to more easily gather slaves but also to deal with any demonic rifts that might appear.* | <li>owns core province 1075</li><li>1075:</li><ul><li>has building cathedral</li><li>fort level is at least 1</li><li>has province modifier mykx_graxarr</li></ul> | <li>the event [Graxarr Everpyre](../events/graxarr_everpyre.md) happens</li> | [Repair Graxarr Temple](#G93_repair_graxarr_temple)<br /> |

| <a name="G93_articles_on_the_crippled_and_limbless">The Crippled and Limbless</a><br />*Many Buccaneers are unhappy, their line of duty is a dangerous one, yet when they get seriously injured, not all captains are willing to compensate the crippled crewmate properly. Some towns which are often visited by particularly ruthless captains have their streets filled with crippled beggars, who weren't fairly compensated at all.\n\nBuccaneers are petitioning for the state to pass a nationwide law to ensure the Article on compensation for the crippled is equal on every ship. Such a reform would also help those people pay for doctors, and thus hopefully enter the workforce once more.* | <li>republican tradition is at least 90</li><li>government reform progress is at least 25</li> | <li>add republican tradition = -10</li><li>change government reform progress = -25</li><li>the event [Articles On The Crippled And Limbless](../events/articles_on_the_crippled_and_limbless.md) happens</li> |  |

Not every dock has one, but most do. \n\nDuels are commonplace in Mykx, and a primary way to settle disputes in both gnoll and pirate society. However many captains forbid infighting on their ships, as such, pirates often collect their grudges whilst onboard, until the ship docks into port and they can draw their weapons on one another a few steps off of the plank.\n\nMany captains are calling for reform, as the dueling culture is costing them valuable crewmembers...* | <li>republican tradition is at least 85</li><li>government reform progress is at least 25</li> | <li>add republican tradition = -10</li><li>change government reform progress = -25</li><li>the event [Articles On Settling Disputes](../events/articles_on_settling_disputes.md) happens</li> | [Punishment Articles](#G93_punishments_in_the_pirate_code)<br />[The Crippled and Limbless](#G93_articles_on_the_crippled_and_limbless)<br /> |

| <a name="G93_articles_on_standardized_prize_shares">Standardized Prize Shares</a><br />*Whenever loot is acquired on a ship, it is divided along certain rules. Most ships assign different weights to different occupations, for example a boy will only get half the share of the prize that a regular crewmember would get. The boatswain, oarsman and doctor would usually get significantly more shares, but the captain almost always takes the largest chunk of the loot.\n\nOn some ships however the captain only takes around four shares of the prize (four times as many as a crewmember), whilst on others they take as much as fourty shares. Such discrepancies are leading to heated debate for regulations, as many fear that if captains grow too rich, they will pose dangers to the state.

Many sailors have not had basic fire, climbing or combat training. It is okay for our slaves to be incompetent for they just have to row, but our own gnollish sailors being untrained is an unnecessary disgrace.\n\nMilitary reformers wish for the state to allot funds to establish a naval academy close to Ilzin Mykx, on Graxilzin.* | <li>mil power is at least 200</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>1078:</li><ul><li>has building university</li></ul></ul><li>Have an advisor of type army_reformer</li><li>1078:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>controlled by is this nation</li><li>base manpower is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -200</li><li>If does not have building is university:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -300</li><li>1078:</li><ul><li>add building = university</li></ul></ul><li>the event [The Naval Academy](../events/the_naval_academy.md) happens</li> | [Form The Marine Corps](#G93_form_the_marine_corps)<br /> |

You can imagine then that despite their culture being rather naval oriented, they aren't particularly fond of swimming. So much so that a large percentage of the gnollish population, even the sailors, cannot in fact swim. This makes the sinking of one of Mykx's ships a total disaster: The gurgled screams of drowning gnolls can be heard across the entire naval battlefield as soon as the first gnoll ship starts sinking. Not only is this bad for morale, it is also an unnecessary loss of sailors. To remedy this issue, teachers from the naval academy have started giving swimming lessons, to the dismay of their students\n\nThe teachers now wish for our administrators to retroactively test all current sailors for swimming capabilities, or send them back to the academy for some quick lessons.* | <li>sailors is at least 1000</li><li>treasury is at least 200</li> | <li>add sailors = -1000</li><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier "mykx_swimming_exams" until otherwise removed</li> | [Build The Naval Academy](#G93_build_the_naval_academy)<br />[Expand The Bureaucracy](#G93_expand_the_bureaucracy)<br /> |

| <a name="G93_naval_adminstrators">Naval Administrators</a><br />*The expansion of our bureaucratic capacity has been succesful, but not severe enough. With many administrators preferring cushy jobs in Ilzin Mykx, a severe loss of administrative capability occurs in faraway provinces. The well paid administrators simply do not wish to move to backwater towns to collect taxes and uphold laws. \n\nA innovative plan would have small to medium-sized coastal towns not be administered by government personnel living there, but rather by administrators who travel by boat from a central large coastal town to a series of nearby towns and villages to do their job.\n\nIn order to facilitate this project, the state will need to ensure those larger towns have access to solid naval infrastructure, so all administrators of a region can dock their ships when needed.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 60</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li><li>has dock building trigger yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "mykx_sailing_administrators" until otherwise removed</li> | [Great Dockyards](#G93_great_dockyards_project)<br /> |

This poses a problem, according to finanicial advisors. Not only because the wealth cannot be taxed, but also because it disappears from the economy, instead of circulating. A solution has been proposed, to open up a national bank, and what better place to do so than in the town of Traveller's Rest, where not too long ago, dwarves tried to do the same.\n\nWe can repurpose some of their buildings and even use some dwarven slaves to help us administer the bank.* | <li>1055:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li><li>base tax is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "mykx_dwarven_bank" until otherwise removed</li><li>add sailors = -2000</li><li>large increase of dwarven tolerance effect = yes</li><li>1055:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>1221:</li><ul><li>add dwarven minority size effect = yes</li></ul> | [Naval Administrators](#G93_naval_adminstrators)<br /> |

His cannons are starting to build a reputation, because of their quality and uniformity. His master claims his dwarf is a descendant from a long line of smiths and has petitioned the government to adopt his methods of cannon-smithing.\n\nAdvisors agree it is time to standardize the circumference of our cannons into a singular size and to start letting foreigners aid our designs.
