| <a name="Z99_army_restructuration">Army Restructuring</a><br />*A mundane military is not befitting of the Realm of Magics. Mages must be integrated at every level, from the lowly initiate learning to graciously serve under their superiors, to powerful war wizards commanding armies of mortals.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>Have an advisor of type army_reformer</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 350</li></ul> | <li>If has advisor is army reformer:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -100</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add mil power = -350</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier black_army_restructuration for 5 years</li> | [The Ascension](#Z99_the_ascension)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_mage_general">Mage-Generals</a><br />*As part of our project to fully mysticize the military, all existing generals will receive mandatory magical training, and if they cannot, they will perish.

| <a name="Z99_promote_meritocracy">Promote Meritocracy</a><br />*Given the legal status of necromancy, there is little use for the dumb grunt in our military. As a result, we must maintain obsessive focus on the quality and merit of even non-magical recruits - the living shall serve in special functions, from skirmishers, elite troops and so on. If they cannot perform in this capacity, they can join the dead.* | <li>is at war with religious enemy</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>army tradition is at least 50</li> | <li>add army tradition = -10</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier black_promote_meritocracy until otherwise removed</li> | [Reformulated Organization](#Z99_magicka_segmentum)<br /> |

We must now dispatch agents to do the hard work of searching in person. For that, the establishment of a grand shipyard will be an absolute necessity.* | <li>Province 740 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li><li>740:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 10</li></ul><li>has shipyard building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>740:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 4</li></ul><li>the event [The Surge](../events/the_surge.md) happens</li> | [Secrets of the North](#Z99_secrets_of_the_north)<br /> |

| <a name="Z99_jorgurem_the_frozen">Jorgurem the Frozen</a><br />*Jorgurem the Frozen, an ancient dragon of impeccable pedigree and a descendant of Elkaesal the White, has been tracked to his lair. Dragons were, of course, beings who are naturally attuned to the Prime Discordant - and could use magic to reshape the world, as the myth tell us. But their time is over. Now we must demonstrate to the world that the new magical order will bring the ascendancy of the mortal races over such relics of the past.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is jorgurem_is_dead_tooltip</li><li>has global flag [jorgurem_is_dead](../flags/jorgurem_is_dead.md)</li></ul> | <li>add prestige excess to splendour effect:</li><ul><li>VAL = 25</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [bd_1_4](../flags/bd_1_4.md)</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li></ul> | [Finding the Surge](#Z99_finding_the_surge)<br /> |

| <a name="Z99_scepter_of_scepters">Scepter of Scepters</a><br />*Ancient magical beasts such as dragons are suffused with the very essence of magic itself: the raw magical chaos that is the Prime Discordant. It is every part of their being, unlike us mortals who must awaken ourselves to soar as they do so naturally. Using this power is unimaginably dangerous, which is why we must ensure we develop a suitably powerful scepter before we attempt to harness it lest we be destroyed by pure Discordance.* | <li>mission completed is Z99_scepter_industry</li><li>has ruler modifier black_scepter_of_scepter</li> | <li>add prestige or monarch power:</li><ul><li>amount = 20</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [bd_1_5](../flags/bd_1_5.md)</li><li>swap non generic missions = yes</li></ul> | [Jorgurem the Frozen](#Z99_jorgurem_the_frozen)<br /> |

| <a name="Z99_arise">Arise</a><br />*Binding souls is simple when they belong to mere mortals, but the soul of a dragon is far greater, and far more dangerous. A well-developed location inhabited by mortals is necessary to provide an anchor for our ritual. Not an easy task, but the reward shall be... sublime.* | <li>has ruler modifier black_scepter_of_scepter</li><li>is not at war</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>dip power is at least 150</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>Province 985 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li><li>985:</li><ul><li>development is at least 30</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -150</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>add dip power = -150</li><li>the event [Arise](../events/arise.md) happens</li> | [Scepter of Scepters](#Z99_scepter_of_scepters)<br /> |

| <a name="Z99_ibevar">Into Ibevar</a><br />*The elves were once the successors of dragonkind, and were the closest beings to tap and understand the magical chaos that is the Prime Discordance. However, their hubris failed them and brought down their once-mighty empire. To claim our right as successor and guide to this realm, we must finally put to bed the haughty pretenses of the elves' rarefied but ultimately pathetic attempts to harness the forces of creation.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>forlorn vale region:</li><ul><li>has elven majority trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>forlorn vale region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has elven majority trigger yes</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has elven majority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Province 352 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add adm power = 100</li> | [The Dark Decree](#Z99_the_dark_decree)<br /> |

| <a name="Z99_a_crown_of_gold">A Crown Of Gold</a><br />*Damescrown is said to be the birthplace of all economy in Cannor, and origin of the demiurge Ara. It is under her will that we have been long been bound to economical turmoil, but no longer. It is time for the Mystic Revolution to come to Damescrown.* | <li>Province 234 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>the event [Damescrown, A Crown of Gold](../events/damescrown_a_crown_of_gold.md) happens</li> | [Of Teal Blood](#Z99_of_teal_blood)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_a_tower_of_black">A Tower Of Black</a><br />*The Black Tower. The Castanorian citadel of Bal Vertesk. It is the symbol of the closest we have gotten to magical dominion. Made infamous by the legendary acolyte of the first Sorcerer-King, the Acolyte Venac the Arrogant, he used the Black Tower to demonstrate to all the power of magic incarnate. We must recapture this symbol of our heritage to demonstrate our fulfillment, and surpassing, of his ancient dream.* | <li>Province 216 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>the event [Vertesk, a Tower of Black](../events/vertesk_a_tower_of_black.md) happens</li> | [A Crown Of Gold](#Z99_a_crown_of_gold)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_the_coal_river">The Coal River</a><br />*The River Alen that touches the great city of Castonath has since turned black to the drudge and coal of Alenic industry. Artificery and mechanical intrusions are a blight upon this world, allowing the mundane to harness technology, and worse, magic, without having taken the Ascendant Path. Magic belongs to those who open themselves to it, and all magic users must endure the toil and hardship and the breaking and opening of minds to accept the Prime Discordance of magical chaos, and no invention must ever be allowed to pervert this process.* | <li>alenic frontier region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has latent trade goods coal</li><li>trade goods is coal</li></ul><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has latent trade goods coal</li><li>trade goods is coal</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If alenic frontier region has latent trade goods is coal, and has trade goods is coal:</li><ul><li>add base production = 5</li></ul> | [A Tower Of Black](#Z99_a_tower_of_black)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_citizen_integration">Citizen Integration</a><br />*Gawed and the Alenic Reach were always known for its great numbers. It's sea of humanity that loomed above the fragile nations of the south. This is a potentially valuable resource, and we must decide how best to exploit it.* | <li>alenic frontier region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>has human majority trigger yes</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has human majority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [A Question of Citizenship](../events/a_question_of_citizenship.md) happens</li> | [The Coal River](#Z99_the_coal_river)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_a_new_supply">Coastal Tears</a><br />*It is said that the shattered islands of Baycodds are in fact made of ancient Damestear meteorites that devastated the Dragon Coast in times past, and that the halflings who lived there were subject to the Prime Discordance - and mutated into gnomes. Whatever the truth is, Baycodds is still a major exporter of Damestear to this day, and it is invaluable to our magical efforts.* | <li>dragon coast region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is damestear</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>trade goods is damestear</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier black_the_coastal_tears until otherwise removed</li> | [Citizen Integration](#Z99_citizen_integration)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_freeing_the_minds">Sanctify the Mind</a><br />*Magic is chaos. Chaos is magic. At the center of it, the fundamental Prime Discordance. The gnomes in their avarice for order have created a style of magic of mathematics and theoreticals, and in recent years, completely overriden the metaphysical and natural nature of magic-crafting through the abomination known as 'artifice'. This scourge, a defiance to the natural order, in truth, must be dealt with, and its practioners with it.* | <li>europe:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has gnomish majority trigger yes</li><li>has gnomish minority trigger yes</li></ul><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has gnomish majority trigger yes</li><li>has gnomish minority trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Freeing the Minds](../events/freeing_the_minds.md) happens</li> | [Coastal Tears](#Z99_a_new_supply)<br /> |

| <a name="Z99_pacifiy_the_east">Pacify the West</a><br />*Some of the mundane residents of the former nations of Western Castanor have decided to resist the new order. They must be made to see that their new role is to serve the glorious ascension of the mortal races through the sacred discipline of magic.* | <li>west castanor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier black_pacifier_of_the_east for 50 years</li> | [Western Consolidation](#Z99_eastern_consolidation)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_gone_with_the_old">Gone With the Old</a><br />*The role the Adventurers have played in recent history cannot be understated, and they are a valuable source of materials from monsters and mystic beasts. Nevertheless, they represent an unacceptable alternative power base and must be restructured to serve the Demesne.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_adventurers_organization_licensed_adventurers</li><li>stability is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>reduce stability or adm power = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier black_adventurer_reform for 3 years</li> | [Mage-Generals](#Z99_mage_general)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_in_her_acolytes_service">[Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] Acolyte's Service</a><br />*Previous incarnations of sorcerous realms and no doubt any realm do-gooders would call 'evil' fully opposed adventurers on every whim. This was their undoing. Adventurers have a sense to do good, but also the sense to gain power, titles and gold on the way - so why not use that to our advantage? Restructuring the adventurers and folding them into the state apparatus will do us well: let them be the chosen and favoured agents to do our dark bidding within the Demesne and beyond. Shower them with titles. And twist their desires to do 'good' on our behalf.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier black_adventurer_reform</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>custom tooltip = in_her_acolytes_service_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [in_her_acolytes_service](../flags/in_her_acolytes_service.md)</li></ul> | [Gone With the Old](#Z99_gone_with_the_old)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_breaking_the_godshield">Breaking the Godshield</a><br />*Arca Corvur, the former citadel of Bal Dostan. When the ancient Castanites were led out of the Deepwoods it was the explorer Dostan who helped lead them out, and it was under his name that the lands to the south of Castanor were attributed to. The Godshield has long protected our somber brothers to the south, and now we must spread once again and bring them underneath our wings.* | <li>Province 441 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li> | <li>the event [Building the Black Shield](../events/building_the_black_shield.md) happens</li> | [Bringer Of Order](#Z99_bringer_of_order)<br /> |

| <a name="Z99_freeing_the_slaves">Freeing the Mind</a><br />*Slavery, serfdom - no matter its names it is an abomination, the ultimate subjugation of sacred intuition, as possible magicians are forced to toil away in hard physical labor. Corvuria, Dostanor, and each of its iterations have been guilty of this tenfold, grinding their people to the bone for paltry crops. We will capture Dostanor and free the magic potentiates from their chains; the rest can remain as they are.* | <li>dostanor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 150</li><li>add prestige excess to splendour effect:</li><ul><li>VAL = 20</li></ul> | [The Sack of Gablainé](#Z99_the_sack_of_gablain)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_end_ettalindes_line">End Ettalinde's Line</a><br />*In ages past Ettalinde the Wretched, one of Nichmer the Sorcerer-King's acolytes, made a dark deal with Aldresian crusaders who were jealous of the longetivity of elven life - and thus, vampires were born. Their ancient hierarchies and traditions predate ours, and they have no doubt kept an eye on our affairs and seek to destroy us from their crypts and lairs, worse, they too undoubtedly hold some of the most powerful sorcerers unknown to man - capable of challenging our own Acolytes and perhaps even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself]. Now that we control their nominal domains of Corvuria, they are now at our mercy, and we must root those who resist from the shadows with mageflame. Those who wish to live, must serve.* | <li>dostanor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>the event [Severing a Wicked Thread](../events/severing_a_wicked_thread.md) happens</li><li>add mil power = -100</li> | [Freeing the Mind](#Z99_freeing_the_slaves)<br /> |

We must decide how to deal with the more mundane creatures, those whose minds are forever closed to the intuition of magics.* | <li>adm power is at least 150</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>dostanor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>the event [Peasant Life](../events/peasant_life.md) happens</li> | [End Ettalinde's Line](#Z99_end_ettalindes_line)<br /> |
| <a name="Z99_the_dark_decree">The Dark Decree</a><br />*Beyond the darkening borders of Dostanor lies The Borders, the bulwark of the Empire of Anbennar. For ages this Empire has been the bastion of all that is good in the world, and for ages it has been the principal power of Cannor. It is time to herald our ascension with the passage of the Dark Decree: we must reject the Emperor's authority in not only our lands but all lands, and directly challenge the Empire of Anbennar's right to even exist in the first place. This will only end in blood.* | <li>power projection is at least 50</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>splendor is at least 500</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of provinces owned or owned by non sovereign subjects with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 20</li><li>is part of hre</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>hre size is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Dark Decree](../events/the_dark_decree.md) happens</li> | [Peasant Life](#Z99_peasant_life)<br /> |

It is here where the elves first arrived over 500 years ago, and it is here where the first humans were truly allowed to master magic and to know the Prime Discordance. It is also here where the great hubris of Dameria and the Empire of Anbennar rose, looking to dictate the fate of all those that touch its seas.* | <li>east damesear area:</li><ul><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>8:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add dip power = 50</li><li>add mil power = 50</li><li>add adm power = 50</li> | [Bind the Eight Sisters](#Z99_seven_jewels)<br /> |

In ages past, it was Castonath that held itself as the city of cities. It was Castonath that was at the center of the known world. And it must become so again. The universe is bound to primal, magical chaos, and Anbenncóst for all its faults is a perfect example of that... but nonetheless, primal chaos must be accepted and intuited and primal chaos must be controlled and forged by a willful user. Castonath is an example of that. An example of will. An example of perseverance through chaos. Castonath is a city of all time, a city of stone. Anbenncóst, is a city of the now, and a city built to flame.* | <li>8:</li><ul><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>the event [All Roads Must Lead to Castonath](../events/all_roads_must_lead_to_castonath.md) happens</li> | [The Dove...](#Z99_for_a_single_crown)<br /> |

The fertile farms of the Small Country have fed Cannor throughout history, but has long been in control of the pestilence that is the halfling kind.

With her machinations came the beautiful forests of the Redglades. For a long time the elves have held this forest sanctuary for their own accords, living out peacefully and largely ignoring the rest of the world.
