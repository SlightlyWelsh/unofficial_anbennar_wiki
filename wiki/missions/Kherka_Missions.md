| <a name="G48_found_the_forges">Establish the Unified Forges</a><br />*Our city is the primary source of metalsmiths among the Kheionai. However, this process currently occurs in a very divided manner, with contracts going out to small forges and guilds. If we were to create a unified a system of forges, we would be able to significantly increase production.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>2773:</li><ul><li>development is at least 15</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>2773:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = kherka_kherkan_forges_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="G48_increase_iron_production">Increase Iron Production</a><br />*The unified forges have been a great success! So much so, in fact, that our current mines are barely able to provide our iron needs, it is clear that a massive expansion will be necessary in the near future.* | <li>2772:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kherka_producing_iron for 20 years</li> | [Establish the Unified Forges](#G48_found_the_forges)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_feed_the_forges">Feed the Forges</a><br />*With the discovery of new mineral sources, our Devandi colonies are greatly helping the buildup of our forges. Fewer citizens in the homeland now have to worry about extracting metals and can instead focus their time on mastering the smithing arts.* | <li>2773:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>trade goods is iron</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>trade goods is copper</li><li>base production is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>2773:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = kherka_kherkan_forges_1</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = kherka_kherkan_forges_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Increase Iron Production](#G48_increase_iron_production)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_guns_of_kherka">Guns of Kherka</a><br />*It has become clear that guns are the future of warfare, and we must not allow our forges and soldiers to fall behind! If we are to maintain status as the weapons hub of Kheionai, we should focus on building firearms en masse.* | <li>weapons is at least 10</li> | <li>country gets the modifier kherka_guns_of_kherka for 50 years</li> | [Invitation to the Gnomes](#G48_invite_gnomish_inventors)<br /> |

| <a name="G48_prospect_chelion">Prospect Chelion</a><br />*Chelion is considered the backwater of our nation, seemingly being the only place that has not been blessed with mineral wealth. Nothing but small pastoral villages dot the landscape. This may soon change however; a large expedition is being mounted, convinced that they may yet find something of value at the footsteps of Mount Meteí.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>2777:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>2777:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = gold</li></ul> | [Expand the Emerald Mines](#G48_expand_emerald_mines)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_alecandi_jewlery">Alecandi Jewlery</a><br />*With the influx of gold from Chelion and gems from Cóskhéis, some of our wealthier citizens have taken to learn a very special type of metalsmithing: jewelry crafting, a most prestigious industry, which is sure to also be extremely profitable.* | <li>2776:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul><li>2777:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 1000</li><li>country gets the modifier kherka_alecandi_jewlery for 25 years</li> | [Prospect Chelion](#G48_prospect_chelion)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_invite_gnomish_inventors">Invitation to the Gnomes</a><br />*From the north of the Kaydhano waters come a small people who call themselves "gnomes". Despite their short stature it is clear that have a penchant for innovation. Perhaps it would do us well to try and allow some of these gnomes to live in our city and suggest improvements to our forges.* | <li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>2773:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is gnomish</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>2773:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = kherka_kherkan_forges_2</li></ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = kherka_kherkan_forges_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul><li>add gnomish minority size effect = yes</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier kherka_gnomish_inventors for 25 years</li><li>largest increase of gnomish tolerance effect = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which = gnomish_race_tolerance_ai</li><li>value = 30</li></ul></ul> | [Feed the Forges](#G48_feed_the_forges)<br /> |

| <a name="G48_expand_emerald_mines">Expand the Emerald Mines</a><br />*Cóskhéis is the home to a series of mines that, differently from those others around our nation, produce not metal but gems. In particular, the beautiful green emeralds are coveted all over the isle. We must make sure to monopolize their production.* | <li>2776:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kherka_emerald_production for 20 years</li> |  |
| <a name="G48_institute_of_prospectors">The Institute of Prospectors</a><br />*The successful enterprise in Chelion has proved that simply relying on native knowledge about a region may lead us to miss the wealth that is hidden underneath the earth. An institution focused exclusively on the prospecting of metals in new colonies shall be founded so that this mistake is never repeated.* | <li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>2776:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>set country flag [kherkan_prospectors](../flags/kherkan_prospectors.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = kherka_institute_of_prospectors</li> | [Prospect Chelion](#G48_prospect_chelion)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_the_foundries_of_south_aelantir">The Foundries of South Aelantir</a><br />*The deep coal mines of Kherka and Bharsídara will feed equally large foundries. These shall serve as the base of the industrial development of our nation!* | <li>2773:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has building furnace</li></ul><li>2666:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has building furnace</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier kherka_foundries_of_south_aelantir until otherwise removed</li> | [Invitation to the Gnomes](#G48_invite_gnomish_inventors)<br />[The Barbarian Forge](#G48_the_barbarian_forge)<br /> |

| <a name="G48_war_with_the_merchants">War with the Merchants</a><br />*The harbour of Ormam will serve as the main port through which our tools and weapons will flow. This will come with the added benefit of us controlling a narrow strip of land which can easily be blocked with fortifications.* | <li>ormam area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = 50</li> | [Bolster Forces](#G48_bolster_forces)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_the_staple_port">The Staple Port</a><br />*Now that Ormam lies solidly within our hands, we will be able to put in a series of regulations so that those who may wish to obtain our work will have to pass through the mercantile checks of the grand harbour.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = kherka_staple_port</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [War with the Merchants](#G48_war_with_the_merchants)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_the_barbarian_forge">The Barbarian Forge</a><br />*It seems these mountain barbarians known as "Mteibhar" have the capability of producing their own weapons, indicating that they must have an easily accessible source of metals. We undoubtedly will be able to better utilize it.* | <li>is neighbor of is Mteibhara</li> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = G63</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li></ul> | [The Institute of Prospectors](#G48_institute_of_prospectors)<br />[Fortify our Flanks](#G48_fortify_our_flanks)<br /> |

| <a name="G48_bolster_forces">Bolster Forces</a><br />*Our city is currently squashed between our neighbors. While our great fort has kept most invaders out, it is clear that if we are to prosper, the heartland of our nation must lie far from its frontier. To do that, first we must significantly increase the size of our army.* | <li>num of generals is at least 1</li><li>army size percentage is at least 0.75</li> | <li>If ormam area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lokemeion area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="G48_attack_the_scholars">Attack the Scholars</a><br />*While relations have mostly been amicable between us and the philosophers of Lokemeion, they do seem to have recently turned their eyes towards the lands to the west, and it would be foolish of us to assume they would never attempt to siege our city. We must strike first; this is the only way through which we may prosper.* | <li>lokemeion area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 50</li> | [Bolster Forces](#G48_bolster_forces)<br /> |
| <a name="G48_fortify_our_flanks">Fortify our Flanks</a><br />*With the significant growth of our holdings in Alecand, we have finally taken off pressure from our capital. However, so that we may be truly secure, a series of fortifications must be built in strategic positions to the north and south, thus preventing any land armies from marching directly to our city.* | <li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>2778:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>add building = fort_16th</li></ul><li>2778:</li><ul><li>add building = fort_16th</li></ul> | [War with the Merchants](#G48_war_with_the_merchants)<br />[Attack the Scholars](#G48_attack_the_scholars)<br /> |
