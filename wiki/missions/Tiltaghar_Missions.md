| <a name="tiltaghar_prepare_army">Prepare the Army</a><br />*Soon after the Command had first made its appearance in Haless, the threat it posed quickly escalated from ‘just another raid’ into a national crisis for many nations, and the centre point for forging new alliances. Rumours have reached us that it is now recovering its forces in order to prepare an invasion of the rest of the ruined kingdoms, and then the Raj itself! We cannot be caught unprepared, lest we be unmade! The Raj depends on us!* | <li>army size percentage is at least 0.8</li><li>num of generals is at least 1</li> | <li>country gets the modifier tiltaghar_prepare_army_modifier for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_sway_sarnavan_vassals">Sway Kamapar and Tilathi</a><br />*The kingdom of Sarnavan is viewed by some within the Raj as an ally, and by others as a subject. The truth is that they are neither, for they are traitors to not just the Raj, but all of Rahen! Though they have fought side by side with the ruined kingdoms and defended against Hobgoblin raids, they do not resent them. In fact, they have allowed some of these brutes to reside within their land! Furthermore, the reports from our spies suggest that they seek to restore what they consider their ‘rightful claim’ to the throne. We cannot rule out the possibility that they seek to ally with the Command against the Raj for their own short sighted gain... Sadly, the Raja has refused to heed our warnings claiming it to be ‘unrealistic’. Though heartbreaking, it is understandable, as it would be a great dishonour for any harimari to strike down any from their own family - not that the rulers of Sarnavan would care. Fortunately, the Raj has us to depend upon. Let us end their pretender Raj and make their subjects see the truth.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>R34:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>R12:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>R10:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 30</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Have an advisor of type statesman</li><li>advisor  is diplomat</li></ul></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>R12:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>R34:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has R34 has vassal of is R10:</li><ul><li>R34:</li><ul><li>the event [An Offer from the Raj](../events/an_offer_from_the_raj.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4474:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = root</li></ul></ul><li>If has R12 has vassal of is R10:</li><ul><li>R12:</li><ul><li>the event [An Offer from the Raj](../events/an_offer_from_the_raj.md) happens</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>4514:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = root</li></ul><li>4509:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = root</li></ul></ul> | [Prepare the Army](#tiltaghar_prepare_army)<br /> |
| <a name="tiltaghar_subdue_parraj">Subdue Parraj</a><br />*The Princedom of Parraj has rebuffed all of our efforts to parley; refusing to work with the ‘oppressors’ in Dhenijansar. Lost to their own pride, they need to be taught to submit, or else they will be lost to the Command like so many before them.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>war with is Parraj</li><li>war with  is Sarnavan</li><li>army size is Sarnavan</li><li>R09:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>army size is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 75</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>R09:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>4467:</li><ul><li>owned by is root</li></ul><li>4475:</li><ul><li>owned by is root</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>If has R09 has exists; and  has R34 has vassal of is root:</li><ul><li>add adm power = -75</li><li>R34:</li><ul><li>inherit = R09</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has R09 has exists; and  does not have vassal of is root:</li><ul><li>4467:</li><ul><li>cede province = root</li></ul><li>4475:</li><ul><li>cede province = root</li></ul></ul><li>bidhilar area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = root</li></ul><li>4510:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = root</li></ul> | [Sway Kamapar and Tilathi](#tiltaghar_sway_sarnavan_vassals)<br /> |

| <a name="tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri">A Deal with Bhuvauri</a><br />*Legend speaks of a brass dragon who defied the second Raj, and encouraged the peoples of Bhuvauri to rebel against their rightful overlords. In accordance with this legend,the traitors seek to imitate their dragon ‘saviour’, depicting him on their banner, as well as creating a dragon’s hoard worth of wealth that languishes in their capital at [R38.Capital.GetCapitalName]... Though they should be crushed and brought back into the fold, that is beyond our authority - and capabilities - as of this moment. Moreover, the gold they have amassed would no doubt be welcome in the wars against the Command Our diplomats inform us that the traitors will see reason and lend a hefty amount of coin, so long as we compensate them afterwards...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_is_in_northern_war_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [tiltaghar_northern_war_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_flag.md)</li></ul><li>war with is The Command</li><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>R38:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri_warning_tooltip</li><li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>set country flag [tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri_accepted_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri_accepted_flag.md)</li><li>If has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_1](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_1.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri_1_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_2](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_2.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri_2_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_3](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_3.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri_3_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_4](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_4.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_bhuvauri_4_modifier</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_deal_dwarves">A Deal with the Dwarves</a><br />*The dwarves once owned an Empire that stretched from the Jademines to the north, west beyond the Daraturkha mountains, what the dwarves call "the tree of stone", to the distant lands of Escann and Castan’s empire. The Hobgoblins did not just invade Rahen in their conquests of greed and glory, but also breached the walls of many of the dwarves’ most prestigious holds - their ‘eastern capital’ of Gronstunad among them. With their great memory, the dwarves  have not forgotten those who brought the collapse of their proud realm. Some have approached us, asking that we strike a deal: they will aid in forging weapons and all manner of things needed to build and maintain an army. In turn, they only ask that they may return home when the war is over...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_is_in_northern_war_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [tiltaghar_northern_war_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_flag.md)</li></ul><li>war with is The Command</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>4397:</li><ul><li>has dwarven minority trigger yes</li></ul><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = tiltaghar_deal_dwarves_warning_tooltip</li><li>add adm power = -200</li><li>set country flag [tiltaghar_deal_dwarves_accepted_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_deal_dwarves_accepted_flag.md)</li><li>If has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_1](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_1.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_dwarves_1_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_2](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_2.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_dwarves_2_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_3](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_3.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_dwarves_3_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_4](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_4.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_dwarves_4_modifier</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs">A Deal with the Brown Orcs</a><br />*Slaves; expendable servants. That is what the hobgoblins think of the orcs they bring to battle. They have received the ‘honour’ of dying to our arrows, and are the first to climb the ladders during any siege. None can blame our populace for the resentment that they hold against the orcs - after all, how can you think any different of one of the core symbols of the Command’s armies? A symbol of the atrocities committed and the cities put to the torch. Fortunately, the leaders of the Command have made a folly. Together with the marching armies of orcs are the human and harimari slaves - those our populace can emphasise with. Let us spin a story of subjugation of an orc kingdom that also fell against the might of the Hobgoblins - make them more... approachable for our own, and allow cooperation.The orcs are themself willing, or so our spies tell us. In return for aiding us in our war against the Command, they only ask that we free them of their chains...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_is_in_northern_war_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [tiltaghar_northern_war_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_flag.md)</li></ul><li>war with is The Command</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture is brown_orc</li><li>base manpower is at least 10</li></ul><li>accepted culture is brown_orc</li> | <li>custom tooltip = tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs_warning_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs_accepted_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs_accepted_flag.md)</li><li>If has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_1](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_1.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs_1_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_2](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_2.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs_2_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_3](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_3.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs_3_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_4](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_4.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_brown_orcs_4_modifier</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_restore_ranks">Restore the Ranks</a><br />*Through years of bloody conflict our armies have been depleted countless times, only for new recruits and sell swords to flock to our banner. With the defeat of the Command however, we can no longer expect this steady flow of men and coin.

| <a name="tiltaghar_philosophy_debate">Philosophy Debate</a><br />*There was an age when the gods roamed the world of mortals. Though they have long since left us, we built temples to honour them, and to lead better lives. Though humans began the practice, they are now outlawed to hold religious office in most of the Raj, but not Tiltaghar.

| <a name="tiltaghar_request_rights_expansion">Request Rights to Expansion</a><br />*In the days of old, the influence of the Raj was much greater than it is today. In order for a senapti to expand, they would need the blessing of the Raj, as it was the duty of the Raj to guarantee the safety of its subjects from outside threats. Though this tradition has long been made redundant by the ambitious and opportunistic, we are different. We shall not let the Raj wither away into memory.

| <a name="tiltaghar_strike_rajnadhaga">Strike on Rajnadhaga</a><br />*The kingdom of Rajnadhaga has a noble goal: unite northern Rahen against the Command threat. The difference between them and us, however, is that they do not recognise the authority of the Raj. This rejection has left them soft and weak, without true purpose or guidance. Our spies inform us that their southern cities reflect this, laying unprepared for any advances from the south. We need only launch but a quick, decisive strike in order to quickly subdue them.

| <a name="tiltaghar_reconquer_sir">Reconquest Sir</a><br />*Sir was the third nation to be invaded by the Command. With the fall of Sir, Rahen and Haless awoke to realise the threat that the Hobgoblins possessed. They could do more than conquer weakened and distracted nations - they were a threat - a threat that had been allowed to fester.

Though we have always had a steady supply of coin from the various guilds and powerful houses, few have donated to us from the goodness of their hearts. They now return to us requesting that we repay our dues. To ensure that our state can fully recover we must comply with this, lest the powerful guilds and castes of Rahen turn against us.* | <li>current income balance is at least 1</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>inflation is at least 5</li></ul><li>NOT:</li><ul><li>num of loans is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = tiltaghar_aftermath_war_production_modifier</li> | [Aftermath of the War](#tiltaghar_aftermath_war)<br /> |

Though we have beaten back the hobgoblins, we must never forget that it was our ignorance, and our lack of respect for the wolves that lurked in the shadows of the north, beyond the light of the Raj, that almost brought about our doom. They may not pose a threat to us now, but we cannot risk that the Oni one day might try to achieve the same goal that the Hobgoblins sought to achieve.

| <a name="tiltaghar_friendly_competition">Friendly Competition</a><br />*The harimari are a proud people, known for their love for tradition, and martial prowess. As a result of these attributes, the human populace was traditionally almost entirely excluded from military service with few exceptions. Not in Tiltaghar. Here the humans have fought side by side with the harimari and defended their homeland like they never could elsewhere. It is undeniable to even the proudest harimari that we would not be where we are today without them. Though there are still divisions within the army, remnants of old, that might hinder us from achieving our true potential. Let us hold great games of martial and athletic prowess to truly force both races to their very limit.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_friendly_competition_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is casteFluidityVar</li><li>value is at least 75</li></ul></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is mil</li><li>culture is royal_harimari</li></ul><li>num of generals with traits is at least 2</li><li>army tradition is at least 50</li> | <li>caste fluidity increase medium = yes</li><li>country gets the modifier tiltaghar_friendly_competition_modifier for 20 years</li> | [Restore Kagurghara](#tiltaghar_restore_kagurghara)<br />[Philosophy Debate](#tiltaghar_philosophy_debate)<br /> |

But the humans of Tiltaghar have proven their worth time, and time, and time again. No longer shall our nation reject those who fought so hard to defend the Raj; they have earned their rights.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_edict_tiltaghar_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is casteFluidityVar</li><li>value is at least 85</li></ul></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_lowercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_middlecastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_uppercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 70</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = tiltaghar_edict_tiltaghar_effect_tooltip</li><li>set country flag [human_in_uppercastes](../flags/human_in_uppercastes.md)</li> | [Friendly Competition](#tiltaghar_friendly_competition)<br /> |

The road is still dotted with houses of respite and obelisks. Yet it now features a new addition. A giant plaque of heroes battling a serpent seeking to devour the land, and their sacrifice immortalised.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>pilgrims road area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>devastation is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier tiltaghar_second_pilgrimage_modifier for 50 years</li> | [The Path of the High Gods](#tiltaghar_path_high_gods)<br /> |

| <a name="tiltaghar_humans_military">Humans in the Military</a><br />*The caste system traditionally only allows for Harimari to serve in the military and protect our nation. This is, if anything, the biggest folly ever committed by the Raj, as the humans are more populous and have many skills useful in the military. They are willing to fight, and we have need of them in the upcoming war against the Command. They will serve.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_uppercastes</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>category is mil</li><li>culture is rajnadhid</li></ul> | <li>define general:</li><ul><li>name = "Wujiada of the Vengeful Gaze"</li><li>shock = 4</li><li>fire = 0</li><li>manuever = 2</li><li>siege = 1</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_prove_worth">Prove their Worth</a><br />*After the fall of Sir and the northern Shamakhad, many warriors began to flee to our lands, hoping to one day be allowed to fight against the Command and free their homelands. They have now trained side by side with our own human soldiers. It is time for them to prove that our trust was not misplaced.* | <li>is in war:</li><ul><li>attacker leader is this nation</li><li>duration is at least 1095</li></ul><li>army tradition is at least 40</li> | <li>country gets the modifier tiltaghar_prove_worth_modifier for 15 years</li> | [Humans in the Military](#tiltaghar_humans_military)<br /> |
| <a name="tiltaghar_expanded_military">Expanded Military</a><br />*Though many harimari within the Raj view it as their duty to serve in the army and defend the nation, our human military has proven invaluable on the battlefield. The recruits and exiles have managed to surpass our most ambitious expectations, even surpassing our harimari warriors in some areas. Far more flexible and less combative than the harimari, the humans in our ranks have been moulded in ways no harimari would ever allow, and are now integral to any military operation we could hope to carry out.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army tradition is at least 50</li><li>army professionalism is at least 0.25</li><li>has estate privilege estate_uppercastes_officer_corp</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier tiltaghar_expanded_military_modifier for 50 years</li><li>caste fluidity increase huge = yes</li> | [Prove their Worth](#tiltaghar_prove_worth)<br /> |
| <a name="tiltaghar_deal_ministries">A Deal with the Ministries</a><br />*Tiltaghar might be a senapti of the Raj, but our administrative duties are expanding far faster than we are able to deal with them. The movement of armies and supply lines; recruits, volunteers, and training; rebuilding of roads, buildings, surveying the damages; taxing our new subjects and cataloguing them and their status, their lands, and its worth; the list is long, and we do not have an army of scribes at our beckon. Fortunately, our overlord does, and is willing to lend us some to help administer our realm. In return, they only ask that they be granted the authority to act without our “burdensome and hindering oversight” to better perform their duties...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_is_in_northern_war_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [tiltaghar_northern_war_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_flag.md)</li></ul><li>war with is The Command</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>has reform raja_reform</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = tiltaghar_deal_ministries_warning_tooltip</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>set country flag [tiltaghar_deal_ministries_accepted_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_deal_ministries_accepted_flag.md)</li><li>If has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_1](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_1.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_ministries_1_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_2](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_2.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_ministries_2_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_3](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_3.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_ministries_3_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_4](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_4.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_deal_ministries_4_modifier</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_deal_elephant_lords">A Deal with the Ghavanaaj</a><br />*In all of the Raj - nay, all the world! - there are no better elephant riders than those from the Ghavaanaj. Their riders and animals are legendary and revered by all. Their society has integrated them to serve every possible niché they could think of - and warfare is no exception. Having these legendary riders and creatures fight alongside our armies would be a great honour. The Ghavaanajare willing to aid us in battle on two conditions. They are to fight under our banner so as to avoid putting their own in the path of peril, and as long as we grant them the privilege to capture a new herd from our lands to replace the the animals that will fall. A great cost, but very likely a fair deal for the prowess they will bring to our cause...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_is_in_northern_war_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [tiltaghar_northern_war_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_flag.md)</li></ul><li>war with is The Command</li><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>primary culture is ghavaanaj</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = tiltaghar_deal_elephant_lords_warning_tooltip</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -500</li><li>set country flag [tiltaghar_deal_elephant_lords_accepted_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_deal_elephant_lords_accepted_flag.md)</li><li>If has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_1](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_1.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_elephant_lords_1_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_2](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_2.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_elephant_lords_2_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_3](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_3.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_elephant_lords_3_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_4](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_4.md):</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_elephant_lords_4_modifier</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_deal_ghankedhen">A Deal with the Shepherds</a><br />*The Ghankedhen tribes make up the northwestern part of the Raj. They are defined by two things: their familial ties, and their ties to the land. Though we do not share a bloodbond, and a harimari is unlikely to ever marry into a human tribe, we do share another bond: the land of Rahen, and ours is crying out for salvation. If we could convince the caretakers of the Raj to aid us on the homefront while our valiant warriors do their utmost to drive back the Command, then it would go a long way to boost both morale of the troops and productivity back home. In turn, they ask only that we return to the land that which we have taken...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_is_in_northern_war_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [tiltaghar_northern_war_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_flag.md)</li></ul><li>war with is The Command</li><li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>primary culture is ghankedhen</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = tiltaghar_deal_ghankedhen_warning_tooltip</li><li>add dip power = -200</li><li>set country flag [tiltaghar_deal_ghankedhen_accepted_flag](../flags/tiltaghar_deal_ghankedhen_accepted_flag.md)</li><li>If has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_1](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_1.md), and has country flag is tiltaghar northern war 2:</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_ghankedhen_1_modifier</li></ul></ul><li>Else if has country flag is [tiltaghar_northern_war_3](../flags/tiltaghar_northern_war_3.md), and has country flag is tiltaghar northern war 4:</li><ul><li>4466:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = tiltaghar_ghankedhen_2_modifier</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="tiltaghar_end_command">The End of the Command</a><br />*As the final armies of the command are routed, and its chiefs kneel before us, a new task is granted to us - a privilege we have long awaited, signing the treaties that will see the end of the command.

Now we may commence the phase of eradicating the largest threat to Rahen in recent memory - the question of the hobgoblins themselves. Many within our nation, from all races, from all castes, support that we ‘finish the job’ and make away with the Hobgoblins once and for all. It is our duty by the Raj that we exterminate this threat to the Raj - or so we thought, but news arrive from the capital that complicate the matter...* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_expel_hobgoblins_shamakhad_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>shamakhad region:</li><ul><li>culture group is hobgoblin</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>culture group is hobgoblin</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tiltaghar_expel_hobgoblins_jade_mines_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>jade mines region:</li><ul><li>culture group is hobgoblin</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>culture group is hobgoblin</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>the event [The Long March](../events/the_long_march.md) happens</li> | [The End of the Command](#tiltaghar_end_command)<br /> |
| <a name="tiltaghar_tiger_ziggurat">The Tiger Ziggurat</a><br />*Our beloved city of Tiltaghar is more than just the namesake of our proud nation, it also features the ziggurat of the tiger. The temple is thought to be the twin temple of the elephant ziggurat in Tilathi and in the days of old, before Harimar walked among us, it was said the temple would shine as bright as the sun itself during the day.Though the Ziggurat has mostly fallen into disrepair due to the enormous costs of maintaining it, it is still an important holy city for all of Rahen, showing the importance of those who would one day walk among us as masters, teachers, and rulers of Rahen - the tiger, ancestors of the harimari. Let us restore the temple and let its radiant light and presence once more brighten our day.* | <li>4466:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>4466:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = tiltaghar_northern_ziggurat</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The First Pilgrimage](#tiltaghar_first_pilgrimage)<br /> |
