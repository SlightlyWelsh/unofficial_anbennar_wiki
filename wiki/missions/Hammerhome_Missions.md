| <a name="Z36_the_castonath_survey">The Castonath Survey</a><br />*Though Castonath is an enormous city, our renowned bookkeeping has allowed the city to maintain itself through our many architects and masons. But, with the Greentide, and the greenskins ravaging the city to a point where it is almost completely unrecognizable from its former glory, we must do something. A Great survey of the city shall begin, detailing every inch of this new, but decrepit Castonath, so that we may effectively restore it to its former glory once more.* | <li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>the event [Preparing the Survey](../events/preparing_the_survey.md) happens</li> | [Securing Castonath](#Z36_securing_castonath_from_all_sides)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_irrigate_the_nath">Irrigate the Nath</a><br />*The Nath was always one of the largest food sources of Escann. But recently, the Nath has been ravaged by the greenskins, making the area hard to do any great feats of farming in. But, Balgar expected this, if Escann were to ever face a peroid of long and horrible starvation and drought, there was a plan. Balgar would take inspiration from the Serpent's vale irrigation from the Dwarovar, and implement in Escann, to gain amazing yields from the crops in the area. We should implement his plan, and finally restore the Nath's farming to its former harvests.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>has country flag [castonath_excursion_done](../flags/castonath_excursion_done.md)</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Z36_irrigate_the_nath_trigger_tt</li><li>owns 837</li><li>owns  839</li><li>owns   841</li><li>owns    853</li><li>owns     855</li><li>owns      865</li><li>owns       872</li><li>owns        873</li><li>owns         879</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>837:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_dwarven_irrigation</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = Z36_irrigate_the_nath_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has province id is 839, and has province id is 841, and has province id is 853, and has province id is 855, and has province id is 865, and has province id is 872, and has province id is 873, and has province id is 879:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_dwarven_irrigation</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has province id is 837, and has province id is 839, and has province id is 841, and has province id is 853, and has province id is 855, and has province id is 865, and has province id is 872, and has province id is 873, and has province id is 879; and does not have trade goods is cloth, and does not have trade goods is glass, and does not have trade goods is paper:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = grain</li></ul></ul> | [The Castonath Survey](#Z36_the_castonath_survey)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_the_iron_hold">Start "The Iron Hold</a><br />*Castonath, even after our great survey, still lies in a state of ruin. Though, of course, Balgar planned for this. The various blueprints and maps found in his manor detail of the foundations of Castonath. We could use these ancient plans to restore Castonath to a dwarven standard once more and revitalize the city as a whole.* | <li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 1500</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_iron_hold</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Irrigate the Nath](#Z36_irrigate_the_nath)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_excavate_marrhold">Excavate Marrhold</a><br />*Marrhold has always been an interesting place in Escann. A Dwarven Hold occupied by humans. Though we have no interest in settling the hold ourselves, we do have another option. We could thoroughly excavate Marrhold to enormous proportions using the holds architecture left behind. Marrhold also houses a large population of humans, which though they may be angry about our excavations in Marrhold, they also serve as a perfect workforce for us. Let us dig Marrhold with dwarven steel and human sweat and make a mine for all of Escann to envy over.* | <li>owns 4097</li><li>treasury is at least 2000</li><li>adm power is at least 150</li> | <li>add treasury = -2000</li><li>add adm power = -150</li><li>4097:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_balgaric_strip_mine</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>the event [A Discovery in Marrhold](../events/a_discovery_in_marrhold.md) happens</li> | [Start "The Iron Hold](#Z36_the_iron_hold)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_a_river_of_smog">A River of Smog</a><br />*The River Alen has always served as a stable source of wood and steel, and we wish to enhance it's potential. Through various means of building manufactories, we can completely build up the river to serve as a major production hub across Escann. Let the roaring fires of Industry consume the river.* | <li>treasury is at least 3000</li><li>adm power is at least 200</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Z36_a_river_of_smog_trigger_tt_1</li><li>owns 229</li><li>owns  725</li><li>owns   726</li><li>owns    729</li><li>owns     749</li><li>owns      751</li><li>owns       753</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Z36_a_river_of_smog_trigger_tt_2</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has institution manufactories</li><li>all owned province:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>province id is at least 229</li><li>province id  is at least 725</li><li>province id   is at least 726</li><li>province id    is at least 729</li><li>province id     is at least 749</li><li>province id      is at least 751</li><li>province id       is at least 753</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 8</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -3000</li><li>add adm power = -200</li><li>229:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_river_of_smog</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = Z36_a_river_of_smog_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has province id is 725, and has province id is 726, and has province id is 729, and has province id is 749, and has province id is 751, and has province id is 753:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_river_of_smog</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Excavate Marrhold](#Z36_excavate_marrhold)<br /> |

| <a name="Z36_friends_below_ground">Friends Below Ground</a><br />*When the Greentide came, the greenskins came from the hold of Khugdihr, one of the last remnant holds of the Dwarovar. Though we do resent the Mountain Dwarves for allowing this to happen, we must come to our senses. The Dwarovar houses thousands, if not millions of orcs and goblins, and it was only Khugdihr holding them back. We must ally with the Agate Dwarves to ensure another calamity on the levels of the Greentide does not happen again.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>owns 2863</li></ul> | <li>If has I07 has owns core province is 2863:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Z36_friends_below_ground_modifier for 25 years</li></ul><li>If has owns is 2863:</li><ul><li>If khugdihr area has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove core = ROOT</li><li>add core = I07</li></ul><li>cede province = I07</li></ul><li>create subject:</li><ul><li>subject type = autonomous_vassal</li><li>subject = I07</li></ul></ul> | [Securing Castonath](#Z36_securing_castonath_from_all_sides)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_serpentspine_trade">Revive the Dwarf Trade</a><br />*With the retaking of Khugdihr and our consolidation of the many mines of Northern Escann, we have been presented an opportunity. Before its fall to the greenskins, Khugdihr was one of the major gateways of the Dwarovar, where trade came in and out. If we were to revive this former trade, we could grant great benefits to both us and Khugdihr.* | <li>dip power is at least 200</li><li>840:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 35</li></ul></ul><li>2868:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is Khugdihr</li><li>share is at least 35</li></ul></ul> | <li>add dip power = -200</li><li>country gets the modifier Z36_revived_serpentspine_trade for 50 years</li><li>I07:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Z36_revived_serpentspine_trade for 50 years</li></ul><li>If has 846 has province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 250</li></ul><li>Else if has 846 has province has center of trade of level is 2:</li><ul><li>846:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>846:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>If has I07 has exists, and I07 is controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 500</li><li>add manpower = 10</li></ul></ul> | [Friends Below Ground](#Z36_friends_below_ground)<br />[Take the Mines](#Z36_take_northern_mines)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_adventurers_north">Send Off the Adventurers</a><br />*With our adventuring calming down, the many adventurers we have invited into our realm have been getting uppity. Many of these adventurers seek adventure on a scale which we currently cannot provide. Though, if we directed these Adventures to the North, not only would they assist Khugdihr in their reclamation efforts, but they would also stop causing so much trouble at home.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_adventurers_generous_quest_rewards</li> | <li>country gets the modifier Z36_adventurers_north_modifier_1 for 25 years</li><li>I07:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Z36_adventurers_north_modifier_2 for 25 years</li></ul> | [Revive the Dwarf Trade](#Z36_serpentspine_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_friendship_unbound">Unbound by Rock</a><br />*With our continued mutually beneficial relationship with the Mountain Dwarves, we have seen a great brotherhood form between our two nations. Both were victims of the orcs, and both have repelled the orcs and goblins back, and exterminated them from ancestral land. Let us continue our dwarven friendship, even if there is a mountain between us!* | <li>I07:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 200</li></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>religion is regent_court</li></ul><li>AND:</li><ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>religion is ancestor_worship</li></ul><li>religion is ancestor_worship</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li></ul> | <li>If has religion is regent court, and  has I07 has religion is ancestor worship:</li><ul><li>add dip power = -100</li></ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = ROOT</li></ul><li>ROOT:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = I07</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier Z36_balgaric_friendship for 50 years</li><li>I07:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Z36_balgaric_friendship for 50 years</li></ul> | [Send Off the Adventurers](#Z36_adventurers_north)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_hold_migrants">Welcome the Hold Migrants</a><br />*Many migrants coming from the surface into the Dwarovar have encountered a few issues. The darkness of the holds, as well as the chaos of the goblin and orcs always threatening them, many have seen it as too much, and wish to return to the surface for a safer life. Though these thoughts would get someone ostracized in the mountain, on the surface, we are more forgiving. Let us take these dwarves to our realm and allow them to settle for a calmer life underneath the sun.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>2863:</li><ul><li>development is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>840:</li><ul><li>If does not have culture is ROOT:</li><ul><li>change culture = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have religion is ROOT:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_hold_migrants_road</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>847:</li><ul><li>If does not have culture is ROOT:</li><ul><li>change culture = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have religion is ROOT:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_hold_migrants_road</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul><li>849:</li><ul><li>If does not have culture is ROOT:</li><ul><li>change culture = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have religion is ROOT:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li></ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_hold_migrants_road</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> | [Unbound by Rock](#Z36_friendship_unbound)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_dwarovar_industralization">Dwarovar Industry</a><br />*The Dwarovar has long been a marvel of engineering. From its mass industrialization in its holds, to its large railways, many have always envied the Dwarovar. But, as dwarves, we hold that spirit in our hearts, and we can begin introducing the Dwarovar's level of industrialization to the surface. Though this would require large amounts of effort form both our Mountain friends and ourselves, the production this could bring would be insane, and we could finally replicate the Dwarovar's level of greatness on the surface.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 10</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul></ul><li>adm power is at least 300</li> | <li>add adm power = -300</li><li>custom tooltip = Z36_dwarovar_industralization_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has dwarven minority trigger is yes, and has culture group is dwarven:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_dwarovar_industralization_modifier</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Welcome the Hold Migrants](#Z36_hold_migrants)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_balgaric_union">The Balgaric Union</a><br />*Balgar, gods bless his name, has always been a great inspiration for all dwarves, surface or mountain. It is no doubt that his will has also inspired our great friendship with Khugdihr. And with that, something has come up. In order to strengthen our bonds, many on our realm seek to have a union between our states. Though it would be costly and arduous, it would certainly ensure a dwarven hegemony in both Escann and the Dwarovar.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>trust:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul></ul><li>I07:</li><ul><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>If has I07 is subject of is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add prestige = 25</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>the event [The Balgaric Union](../events/the_balgaric_union.md) happens</li></ul> | [Dwarovar Industry](#Z36_dwarovar_industralization)<br /> |

| <a name="Z36_new_home_for_dwarves">A New Home for the Dwarves</a><br />*The dwarves, though an ancient and proud race, have recently been seen with a string of failures. The Silver Dwarves have long attempted to futilely finish their hold, and the Ruby Dwarves have seen their influence on the empires of man diminished severely. But the Stone Dwarves have always been a special kind, from Balgar's great wonders, to our introduction of gunpowder weapons in the Greentide. Though the Stone Dwarves have had a proud history, we have been just a minority in the many places we have inhabited, but, the Greentide has granted us an opportunity. The de-population of Escann has presented us with large swathes of land for us to settle in. Let us take Balgar's city for ourselves and secure it as a new home for the Stone Dwarves, one which we can truly reign free in!* | <li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier Z36_new_home_for_dwarves for 20 years</li><li>set capital = 833</li> |  |
| <a name="Z36_securing_castonath_from_all_sides">Securing Castonath</a><br />*Though we have secured Balgar's city, we have encountered a problem. The many ambitious human adventurer kingdoms, as well as the vile greenskins, wish to take the city of Castonath for themselves. Due to Balgar's wisdom in modeling Castonath after a hold, the city itself is extremely defensible despite its size. If we were to fortify the city completely, we would finally be able to project our influence in the surrounding areas of the city, allowing us to fully secure the city's position.* | <li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>castonath area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Z36_protecting_the_ancient_capital</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If nortmere area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If southgate area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If trialmount area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If upper nath area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lower nath area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A New Home for the Dwarves](#Z36_new_home_for_dwarves)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_take_northern_mines">Take the Mines</a><br />*The northern mines were always the main source of minerals all across Escann, and though their yields still exist, they have for decades, been used by the vile orcs to fuel their war instead. Let us take back these mines, and utilize them for our great dwarven crafts instead, and remove the orcish stain on these mines once and for all.* | <li>upper nath area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>trialmount area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If serpentsmarck area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If bradescker area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If steelhyl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If coalwoud area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If clouded wood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Securing Castonath](#Z36_securing_castonath_from_all_sides)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_seize_the_white_walls">Seize the White Walls</a><br />*One of Balgar's greatest works, the White Walls of Castanor, has long been neglected and put into a state of decrepitude. Due to the human’s decadence of ruling over Escann, the walls lost their once mighty purpose to once defend the heartland of Escann. We, as a dwarven state know how to properly utilize and defend these walls. Let us seize them, and make sure these walls never fall a second time!* | <li>serpentsmarck area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>bradescker area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>steelhyl area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>coalwoud area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>clouded wood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If westgate area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If northyl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If oldhaven area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ardent glade area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>756:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Take the Mines](#Z36_take_northern_mines)<br /> |
| <a name="Z36_secure_the_eastern_woods">Secure the Eastern Woods</a><br />*The Eastern woods of Escann have always housed many sources of woodcutting and minerals. If we were to seize the area, we could increase our production of various goods by a lot. It also gives us access to the many cave entrances of the Dwarovar, which ensures we will not see a threat emerge from their again.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Z36_secure_the_eastern_woods_trigger_tt</li><li>owns 828</li><li>owns  829</li><li>owns   830</li><li>owns    855</li><li>owns     860</li><li>owns      862</li><li>owns       865</li><li>owns        866</li><li>owns         869</li><li>owns          873</li><li>owns           874</li></ul> | <li>If sarwood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If nortessord area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If esshyl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Seize the White Walls](#Z36_seize_the_white_walls)<br /> |
