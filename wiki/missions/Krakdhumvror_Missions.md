| <a name="krak_clear_view">In Clear View</a><br />*The surface hold of Dûr-Vazhatun sits directly across the valley from our own mountain home. It was the last stop for those sent or coming to our hold to hear news of the empire before crossing the valley to the Anvil. The old observatories and laboratories here still remain somewhat intact, as does most of the hold.\n\nIt seems as though it was too far east for any orcs or goblins to bother settling in its ruins and that seems to have spared the hold from any real infestation. We should reoccupy and rebuild this once-great hold to use as our forward base in pushing into the empire of old.* | <li>4020:</li><ul><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>4020:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_building_cost</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Breathe the Fresh Air](#krak_breathe_air)<br /> |
| <a name="krak_our_gateway">Our Gateway</a><br />*The renovations of Dûr-Vazhatun are complete, and we have added some significant fortifications to the mountain entrance as well. We can now use this as a very secure point from which to push into the Dwarovar and it will help to keep out any remaining goblins or orcs left over in the tunnels from harassing us.* | <li>4020:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_undamaged_hold_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul><li>development is at least 20</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>If vazhatun area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>3001:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [In Clear View](#krak_clear_view)<br /> |

| <a name="krak_basic_logistics">Basic Logistics</a><br />*With our new northern outpost in Fýllstýn all set up, we have discovered a new issue harrying our expeditions. It is no easy task to move supplies about the Northern Pass, especially in the winter. Even the short gap of Tanning Valley becomes treacherous and slowgoing, which is part of what caused our initial colonization disaster in the Dagrinrod.\n\nWe need to establish a solid and secure road network that will be maintained all year round along its whole length, guaranteeing that our supplies get where they need to go, when they need to get there.* | <li>4198:</li><ul><li>development is at least 8</li></ul><li>4201:</li><ul><li>development is at least 8</li></ul><li>6196:</li><ul><li>development is at least 8</li></ul><li>6214:</li><ul><li>development is at least 8</li></ul> | <li>4198:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4201:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>6196:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>6214:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [A Steady Path](../events/a_steady_path.md) happens</li></ul> | [Reckless Advance](#krak_reckless_advance)<br />[The Frozen Wastes](#krak_frozen_wastes)<br /> |
| <a name="krak_mapping_dwarovar">Mapping the Dwarovar</a><br />*We have need of updated maps of the Dwarovar if we are to push in and recolonize it. Once we have fortified the major entry points of King's Rock, Cutback Valley, and Dûr-Vazhatun, we can assemble some scouting parties and send them into the tunnels to find out what's going on down there.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_mapping_dwarovar_tooltip</li><li>4198:</li><ul><li>has province modifier krak_basic_road</li></ul><li>4201:</li><ul><li>has province modifier krak_basic_road</li></ul><li>6196:</li><ul><li>has province modifier krak_basic_road</li></ul><li>6214:</li><ul><li>has province modifier krak_basic_road</li></ul></ul><li>4020:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_mapping_dwarovar_tooltip2</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>infantry in province is at least 2</li></ul><li>4128:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_mapping_dwarovar_tooltip2</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>infantry in province is at least 2</li></ul><li>4122:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_mapping_dwarovar_tooltip2</li><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul><li>infantry in province is at least 2</li></ul><li>4171:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>infantry in province is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>4020:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = infantry</li><li>amount = 2</li></ul></ul><li>4128:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = infantry</li><li>amount = 2</li></ul></ul><li>4122:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = infantry</li><li>amount = 2</li></ul></ul><li>4171:</li><ul><li>kill units:</li><ul><li>who = owner</li><li>type = infantry</li><li>amount = 2</li></ul></ul><li>railyard area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>mithradhum area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>khugdihr area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dagrinrod 4 6 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dagrinrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>railyard area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>mithradhum area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>khugdihr area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>dwarovrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>dagrinrod 4 6 area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have discovered is ROOT:</li><ul><li>dagrinrod 7 9 area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Basic Logistics](#krak_basic_logistics)<br /> |
| <a name="krak_heart_dwarovar">Heart of the Dwarovar</a><br />*Er-Natvir was always considered the beating heart of the Dwarovar, its role as the central junction of all the rail lines meant that everything flowed to and from the hold.\n\nIf we can take Er-Natvir and establish some fortifications to ease in its defense, we would have an easy point from which to distribute supplies and soldiers to all of our mountain territories.* | <li>2931:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_undamaged_hold_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>If has mission completed is krak mountain gate:</li><ul><li>dwarovrod 1 3 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 4 6 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 10 12 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Mapping the Dwarovar](#krak_mapping_dwarovar)<br /> |
| <a name="krak_krakdhumrod">The Krakdhûmrod</a><br />*With so much territory now inside the Serpentspine Mountains, we are having delays in our messages and supplies from backed up convoys in the Tanning Valley, waiting in great queues at the gates on either side for passage through. If we were to connect the Anvil to the Dagrinrod rail line we would be able to bypass that traffic backup and have people travel direct to Krakdhûmvror!* | <li>treasury is at least 3000</li><li>adm power is at least 300</li> | <li>add treasury = -3000</li><li>add adm power = -300</li><li>dead end tunnel area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If krakdhum area does not have province id is 4208:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>anvils horn area:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4201:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>4198:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_road_building</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [The Krakdhûmrod](../events/the_krakdhumrod.md) happens</li></ul> | [Linking our Lands](#krak_linking_lands)<br /> |
| <a name="krak_fire_ice">Fire and Ice</a><br />*Gor Bûrad was built inside a great volcano in the Serpentsreach Mountains. The dwarves of Gor Bûrad were well known for using the magma and heat of the volcano in the Ghelebûr Krakdhûm, the Fireglass Forges. These forges produced obsidian and glass at staggering rates.\n\nThough its environment is the diametric opposite of what we live in, with its lake of magma and sweltering temperatures, we should, nonetheless, reclaim this powerful hold. Our Ice-Smiths have had a thought to use the magma in their Ice-Smithing, indeed they theorize that performing the forging in such heats might temper and strengthen the Ice-Steel.\n\nLet us just hope they know what they're doing, playing with a volcano!* | <li>has institution manufactories</li><li>4039:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_undamaged_hold_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul><li>development is at least 60</li><li>has building mage_tower</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>trade goods is gold</li></ul><li>has dwarven hold 4 yes</li><li>has province modifier krak_ice_hold_modifier</li></ul> | <li>the event [Harnessing the Volcano](../events/harnessing_the_volcano.md) happens</li> | [Within our Reach](#krak_within_reach)<br /> |

If we can secure enough, we will assemble the necessary resources to bring it to Gor Bûrad post haste.

| <a name="krak_molten_core">The Molten Core</a><br />*Now that the Damestear has been secured, the second thing we will need is a massive supply of iron to make the Ice-Steel we will need. We will also need to dig enough new space in Gor Bûrad for the mechanisms and workshops required to make all this happen and we will need more room in Krakdhûmvror as well to house the final product and integrate it into our foundries and Ice-Crafting apparatuses.

| <a name="krak_towards_surface">Towards the Surface</a><br />*Long have the Quartz Dwarves been content to stay in our hold and ignore the world outside. But with the orcs having passed and the other dwarves reduced to surface adventurers or small remnants like us, our people wish to know what is going on outside our doors.\n\nOur council has had an idea. Krakdhûmvror has been growing lately and could use the extra space. Why not push into the tunnels to the south-west, towards the surface? We could reclaim the whole of the Anvil and establish a link to the surface for new resources and information.* | <li>4207:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is city</li></ul> | <li>krakdhum area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>dead end tunnel area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>anvils horn area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier krak_resettle_anvil for 30 years</li> |  |

| <a name="krak_surroundings">Our Surroundings</a><br />*It has been so long since any Quartz Dwarf ventured outside the Giant's Anvil. We should send out some initial scouting parties into Tanning Valley and get the lay of the land. Then we must decide where best to send our teams to get a forward outpost up and running as soon as possible.\n\nWith all that complete, we will have a base from which we can mount further expeditions into the Northern Pass and beyond.* | <li>4201:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>manpower is at least 3</li> | <li>add manpower = -3</li><li>If tanning valley area does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>5001:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>5303:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li></ul><li>6196:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4191:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4197:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>4199:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Breathe the Fresh Air](#krak_breathe_air)<br /> |

With our push into the Northern Pass, we can easily move our efforts south to the Vale instead. We'll be in Amldihr in no time.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 5</li><li>region is northern_pass_region</li></ul> | <li>amldihr area:</li><ul><li>discover country = ROOT</li><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier krak_colonial_rush for 20 years</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Disunity](../events/disunity.md) happens</li></ul> | [In Clear View](#krak_clear_view)<br />[Our Surroundings](#krak_surroundings)<br /> |

Our scouts report no more signs of orcish or goblin control on the King's Rock.\n\nWith the old seat secured, we should push out and take over the Vale that surrounds the mountain. It may have become a swamp, but it might still hold value. Not to mention how many dangers might lurk out there.* | <li>amldihr area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul><li>stability is at least 1</li> | <li>serpents vale region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [Unsteady Rule](../events/unsteady_rule.md) happens</li></ul> | [To Amldihr](#krak_amldihr)<br /> |

| <a name="krak_frozen_wastes">The Frozen Wastes</a><br />*The Quartz Dwarves have lived in the Giant's Anvil mountains for millenia, since the days of the Ice Giants. We are used to being the furthest northern point in the dwarven realms though there is much land further north than ours. No one that we have ever heard of, dwarf or otherwise, has tried to journey north into the frozen wastelands, fearing that giants and monsters and ancient evil magics rule there still.\n\nBut we know better. There have been no giants for hundreds of years. We shall act accordingly.\n\nLet us clear the lands in our northernmost holdings of threats so we can set up a base of operations for expeditions into the northern wastes. Even if the giants simply went there to die, there could be unknowable treasures waiting for us at their graves.* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>6214:</li><ul><li>religion is ancestor_worship</li><li>culture is quartz_dwarf</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_frozen_wastes_tooltip</li><li>has province modifier dwarven_majority_primary</li><li>has orcish minority trigger no</li><li>has goblin minority trigger no</li><li>has troll minority trigger no</li><li>has half orcish minority trigger no</li></ul></ul> | <li>6214:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add devastation = -25</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_building_cost</li><li>duration = 3650</li></ul></ul> | [Strength in Unity](#krak_way_forward)<br /> |
| <a name="krak_natural_element">Our Natural Element</a><br />*The Ice-Smiths have come to us with an interesting proposal recently. They wish to have a research station set up in our arctic holdings to study their magics in its natural element. They believe, since our people are so used to the cold anyways, that we should encourage colonization of the region.\n\nThis will give the Ice-Smiths the opportunity to observe and test their magic in the field, and they have promised to dedicate some of their research to finding ways to help our colonies.* | <li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li><li>6196:</li><ul><li>has building mage_tower</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>hjyrtsikki area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = krak_arctic_development</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Frozen Wastes](#krak_frozen_wastes)<br /> |
| <a name="krak_great_expedition">The Great Expedition</a><br />*We have the infrastructure in place now to actually begin preparations for a great expedition north into the Frozen Wastes. Who knows if we might find the graves of the last frost giants? Perhaps there will just be yet more trolls, perhaps there will be something else we've never even thought to imagine. But one thing is certain: though the cold has kept most explorers back before, with our natural tolerance to it and our Ice-Smithing we will be able to withstand it and brave its deepest secretes.* | <li>treasury is at least 1000</li><li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>stability is at least 1</li><li>6214:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -1000</li><li>add manpower = -5</li><li>the event [The Great Expedition](../events/the_great_expedition.md) happens</li><li>If has government is republic:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = krak_great_expedition_tooltip</li></ul> | [Basic Logistics](#krak_basic_logistics)<br />[Our Natural Element](#krak_natural_element)<br /> |

They remain there still, our old enemies, fighting amongst the human remnants and various adventuring companies.\n\nIf we are to prevent them from getting back in, we must take Khugdihr hold, the westernmost entrance to the Dwarovar, and fortify its gates so that the orcs have no chance of breaking through!* | <li>2863:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is krak_undamaged_hold_tooltip</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li><li>has building ramparts</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>If has mission completed is krak heart dwarovar:</li><ul><li>dwarovrod 1 3 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 4 6 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>dwarovrod 10 12 area:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Mapping the Dwarovar](#krak_mapping_dwarovar)<br /> |
