| <a name="A97_conquer_iochand">Conquer Iochand</a><br />*Iochand was a gnomish duchy in the past. Since recent times though it's been an area split between Reveria and the gnomish city state Portnamm. This land includes the halfling city of Turnwell, which would already be a part of the Small Country if not for outsider meddling. The Portroy river which mostly flows through the Small Country enters the western ocean through the city of Portnamm. So any expansion aimed towards the western ocean should start with Iochand.* | <li>iochand area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If reaver coast area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>167:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>148:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>144:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>145:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Unite the Small Country](#A97_unite_small_country)<br /> |

| <a name="A97_conquer_dragonhills">Tame the Dragon</a><br />*We must strike the first blow against Gawed, and weaken their strength for the coming wars. Claiming the foothills of the Dragon Coast seems like a good start, and will force the gnomes to give us grudging respect.* | <li>dragonhills area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If floodmarches area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>216:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Expel the Reavers](#A97_conquer_reaver_coast)<br /> |
| <a name="A97_floodmarches_fort">Fortified Floodmarches</a><br />*The Floodmarches are the perfect defensive location to protect the Small Country from the North. A narrow strip of land, marshy, local salt supplies for preserving supplies, and a coast to import supplies from. This will be the Northern border of the Small Country.* | <li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>floodmarches area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>215:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_border_fort</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Tame the Dragon](#A97_conquer_dragonhills)<br /> |

| <a name="A97_colonial_dalaire">Colonize Dalaire</a><br />*Dalaire is not the perfect farmland halflings of the Small Country want, but it's an issue of distance. Ships can easily reach Dalaire, and there are many halflings that would even be willing to live in Dalaire for the chance of their own farmland. It's not all bad, the South is warm enough.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A97_colonial_dalaire_tooltip</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is this nation</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_dalaire</li></ul><li>num of cities is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "colonial_enthusiasm" for 25 years</li> | [Conquer Iochand](#A97_conquer_iochand)<br /> |

| <a name="A97_conquer_southroy">Expand to the Middanroy</a><br />*The Middanroy river runs most of its path through the Small Country. In the southwest it'd be a fitting place to define our border.

Now halfling trade is done by halflings for their own benefit. We must keep it safe under the Small Country.* | <li>66:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 60</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 1</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>66:</li><ul><li>If random trade node member province has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>save event target as = reward_province</li></ul><li>If random trade node member province has owned by is ROOT, and  is a capital:</li><ul><li>save event target as = reward_province</li></ul><li>If random trade node member province has owned by is ROOT, and  has development is CAPITAL, and  is not a capital:</li><ul><li>save event target as = reward_province</li></ul><li>If random trade node member province has owned by is ROOT, and  has development is CAPITAL, and  is not a capital, and  has development is 20:</li><ul><li>save event target as = reward_province</li></ul><li>If random trade node member province has owned by is ROOT, and  has development is CAPITAL, and  is not a capital, and  has development is 25:</li><ul><li>save event target as = reward_province</li></ul><li>If random trade node member province has owned by is ROOT, and  has development is CAPITAL, and  is not a capital, and  has development is 30:</li><ul><li>save event target as = reward_province</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If has saved event target is reward province:</li><ul><li>event target:reward province:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "dominant_trade_hub"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = dominant_home_node_reward_tooltip</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="A97_dragon_coast">Northern Trade</a><br />*When looking abroad for trade partners, our only unique advantage is to go North to the Dragon Coast. The only way goods get from Gerudia to the Damescrown is South along the coast, and often through the Small Country.* | <li>177:</li><ul><li>trade share:</li><ul><li>country is this nation</li><li>share is at least 30</li></ul></ul> | <li>add mercantilism = 1</li><li>country gets the modifier "small_country_northern_trade" for 25 years</li> | [Home Trade](#A97_home_trade)<br /> |
| <a name="A97_damescrown">Control Damescrown</a><br />*Halflings are famous traders in the Dameshead.

| <a name="A97_colonial_banished_isles">Establish Colonial Offices</a><br />*With our colonial efforts growing it makes sense to create a dedicated government office for their management. Based out of Portnamm, the colonial offices will be dedicated to ensuring effective governing of colonial efforts in Aelantir, meaning they stay loyal and ensure that goods produced there go to the Small Country first.* | <li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is A97_colonial_banished_isles_tooltip</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>is colonial nation of is this nation</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>colonial region is colonial_isles</li></ul><li>num of cities is at least 10</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>country gets the modifier "small_country_colonial_office" until otherwise removed</li> | [Expand to the Middanroy](#A97_conquer_southroy)<br /> |

| <a name="A97_rebuild_viswall">Rebuild Viswall</a><br />*Viswall was a great halfling city, sadly split in two after the Viswall rebellion led to Gawed and Lorent cooperating to put the halflings down. In the wars since, including those to unite the Small Country, Viswall has received further damage. Our first priority as a unified Small Country should be repairing this grand city.* | <li>63:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul><li>66:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>province has center of trade of level is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>the event [An Artist](../events/an_artist.md) happens</li><li>If does not have capital is 63, and does not have capital is 66:</li><ul><li>the event [Capital of Viswall](../events/capital_of_viswall.md) happens</li></ul><li>If viswall area has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "growth_of_capital"</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> |  |

Large stocks of grain and wood are carried down the river or through the forest to be processed in the watermills of Greymill. During the Wars of Dominion Lorentish armies burned many of the mills down. * | <li>natural scientist is at least 3</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>norley area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>norley area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_greymill</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "building_spree" for 25 years</li> | [Rebuild Viswall](#A97_rebuild_viswall)<br /> |
| <a name="A97_viswall_brandy">Viswall Brandy</a><br />*Long have the Redfoot Halflings of Appleton made their apples into cider and the Bluefoot Halflings of Pearview made their pears into perry. As a symbol of halfling unification, we have also united their alcohols: combining cider with perry, and distilling the result, has given us an excellent new liquor we have appropriately named after the city of Viswall: Viswall Brandy! While its popularity among halflings owes something to symbolism, its high alcohol content ensures its popularity even further.* | <li>63:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>66:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>147:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>139:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>147:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = wine</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_brandy</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>139:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = wine</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_brandy</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>63:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_brandy</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>66:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_brandy</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "beepeck_new_market" for 20 years</li> | [Reinvigorate Greymill](#A97_reinvigorate_greymill)<br /> |
| <a name="A97_hardoaks_hardwood">Hardoaks Hardwood</a><br />*The region of Elkmarch (called Lorentish Approach by the Gawedi) is the largest forest in the Small Country. It's the only part where hunting is a common job for halflings. Within Elkmarch, the town of Hardoaks produces very fine lumber, some of it drawn from the rest of the forest. High quality wood allows local building projects to be completed easier, and is great for shipbuilding.* | <li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>lorentish approach area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>lorentish approach area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_hardwood</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "growing_economy" for 25 years</li> | [Viswall Brandy](#A97_viswall_brandy)<br /> |

Large scale cloth production is done in the city of Barrowshire, while copper mines fill the hills nearby. We should invest in this region to establish an industrial zone for weapons production and more.* | <li>164:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>160:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul><li>161:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>the borders area:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = small_country_coppertown_industry</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "thriving_arms_industry" for 25 years</li> | [Hardoaks Hardwood](#A97_hardoaks_hardwood)<br /> |
| <a name="A97_halfling_weed">Cultivate Tipney Leaf</a><br />*Tipney Leaf is a traditional halfling crop grown to be smoked for a relaxing effect. Production has been most prominent in Tipney, and stayed a product consumed mainly by halflings. Once tobacco was discovered in Aelantir though, the rest of Cannor got interested in it. New halfling leaf plantations started around the Small Country shortly after.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 3</li><li>region is small_country_region</li><li>trade goods is tobacco</li><li>base production is at least 5</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>135:</li><ul><li>If has building is plantations:</li><ul><li>add base production = 6</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add base production = 3</li><li>add building = plantations</li></ul></ul> | [Coppertown Industry](#A97_coppertown_industry)<br /> |

| <a name="A97_conquer_beepeck">Integrate Beepeck</a><br />*Beepeck sticks out from the rest of the Small Country as a halfling city that has retained pseudo-independence and safety within the Empire of Anbennar. It is for this reason that they decided to stay out of our newly unified Small Country.

Halflings suffered during the war, but the League of Free Realms saved the Small Country. However, after saving the Small Country, a large group of soldiers decided to take some land for themselves. That land would become Uelaire. It's finally time to retake the part of the Small Country that's been missing for so long.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 207</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  209</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of   347</li> | <li>If exwes area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Integrate Beepeck](#A97_conquer_beepeck)<br /> |
| <a name="A97_conquer_exwes">Extend our Reach South</a><br />*With our people mostly united, we need to make sure we have the defenses to maintain it, and coin to pay for it.
