| <a name="marrhold_griffon_prince">The Griffon Prince</a><br />*Even if many dare call us cowards for retreating into the security of our mountain home as the Greentide raged on, saving thousands of lives of our countrymen, not all of us did so.\n\nOur young prince, Gryf, as well as many knights of the Order of the Griffon, went out and confronted the green menace head on, fighting alongside the Marcher Lords and Corin in many decisive battles. Let us celebrate his heroic legacy!* | <li>mil is at least 4</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "marrhold_griffon_heroes" for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="marrhold_griffon_knights">The Order of the Griffon</a><br />*A sad reality of our intervention during the Greentide is that, whilst most of our population was spared the horrors of war, the same can't be said of our legendary griffon knights, many of them giving their lives in the defense of the realm and Escann as a whole.\n\nIt is time for a new generation of griffon riders to be trained, so that they may replenish their numbers.* | <li>895:</li><ul><li>base manpower is at least 8</li><li>has manpower building trigger yes</li><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "marrhold_knights_griffon" for 75 years</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_marrhold_griffon_knight</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [The Griffon Prince](#marrhold_griffon_prince)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_revenge">Revenge</a><br />*Our explorers report that a warlord of the nearby orc tribe we are at war with wears a cloak made with the feathers of fallen griffons, as a sort of brutish ‘trophy’. It is time to right this wrong.* | <li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li><li>culture group is orcish</li></ul> | <li>the event [Revenge](../events/revenge.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="marrhold_justice">Justice</a><br />*With the orc warlord captured, it is time for us to impart justice. Seovol will be avenged.* | <li>any neighbor country:</li><ul><li>war with is this nation</li><li>culture group is orcish</li><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>is a capital</li><li>is looted</li><li>devastation is at least 10</li><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>the event [Justice](../events/justice.md) happens</li> | [Revenge](#marrhold_revenge)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_rebirth">Rebirth</a><br />*After the recent conflict, many questions remain. What will the future of Marrhold be, in this brand new Escann we find ourselves in? As our monarch ponders this, a new generation has been born, ready to answer this question.* | <li>heir has ruler dynasty</li><li>heir age is at least 12</li> | <li>the event [Rebirth](../events/rebirth.md) happens</li><li>increase heir dip effect = yes</li><li>increase heir mil effect = yes</li> | [Justice](#marrhold_justice)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_auxiliaries">Auxiliary Units</a><br />*As our army grows, some among our leadership think it would be wise to reconsider how we use our griffons. Traditionally, they have only been given to our knights and heroes, but perhaps there are other military roles for which our feathered friends are uniquely suited for, such as the one of courier.* | <li>num of cavalry is at least 12</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "marrhold_reestructure" for 10 years</li><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>loyalty = -10</li></ul><li>add estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_adventurers</li><li>loyalty = 20</li></ul> | [Room for Improvement](#marrhold_improvements)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_angels">Battlefield Angels</a><br />*Our recent decision to incorporate griffons into non-combat roles seems to bear fruit. Of particular notice is some of our men using griffons to quickly transport the wounded from the battlefield to our camps, so that they may be treated quicker. Let us expand into this idea and establish a unit of winged medics!* | <li>regimental camp is at least 10</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "marrhold_salvation" for 20 years</li> | [Auxiliary Units](#marrhold_auxiliaries)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_crimson_deluge">On Crimson Wings</a><br />*As the skies have turned red and rains blood, many in our country have fallen into hysteria, preaching that it’s a sign of Corin’s battle to claim the throne of the Gods. No matter the cause, we shall weather the storm, soaring over the clouds!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has global flag [crimson_deluge_is_over](../flags/crimson_deluge_is_over.md)</li><li>has global flag  crimson_deluge_is_actively_happening</li></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>religion is regent_court</li><li>religion  is corinite</li></ul> | <li>If has religion is regent court, and does not have religion is corinite:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_religious_regent for 20 years</li></ul><li>Else if has religion is corinite, and does not have religion is regent court:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_religious_corin for 20 years</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_religious_regent for 20 years</li><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_religious_corin for 20 years</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="marrhold_religious_war">Our Men March to War</a><br />*As religious tension boils all over Cannor, it is clear that it will lead to war. Whilst many in Marrhold argue in favour of staying away from the conflict, the soul of the entire continent depends on it!\n\nAs it was during the War of the Sorcerer-King and the Greentide, it is our duty to sally forth and crush this evil, and ensure the true faith is victorious.* | <li>hre has leagues enabled</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>in league is regent_court</li><li>in league  is corinite</li></ul> | <li>add yearly manpower = 5</li><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_religious_war for 20 years</li> | [On Crimson Wings](#marrhold_crimson_deluge)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_Plan_B">Plan B</a><br />*As technology advances and artificery becomes commonplace, firearms and all manners of projectiles have been developed, able to shoot down our griffon riders.\n\nWhilst we feared the possibility of them becoming outdated in the modern battlefield, a local artificer has presented us with a truly revolutionary idea, that he calls "Plan B": Throwing explosives from the air using the griffons. We should immediately develop this idea, and create the very first unit of Griffon Bombardiers!* | <li>is institution enabled is manufactories</li><li>has estate estate_artificers</li><li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_artificers</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul> | <li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_marrhold_griffon_bombardiers</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [The Feather Academy](#marrhold_feather_academy)<br /> |

| <a name="marrhold_valley">Down the Valley</a><br />*Ever since our ancestors arrived in Escann, we have inhabited the valley, its fertile lands being the breadbasket for the entire kingdom. Recently however, a barbaric orc tribe dared to settle our land. Let’s give them a piece of our mind, and reconquer our rightful lands!* | <li>dryadsdale area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_reclaimed_land for 20 years</li><li>If dryadsdale area does not have culture is marrodic:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>change culture = marrodic</li></ul> | [Reclamation Day](#marrhold_reclamation_day)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_stables">The Royal Stables</a><br />*As our kingdom expands, so does our army, and thus our need for more griffons. Now that we’ve reconquered the lush Dryadsdale, we shall build the Griffon Royal Stables there, in order to breed and train these majestic beasts to suit our needs.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li><li>has building farm_estate</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_griffon_breeding for 20 years</li> | [The Order of the Griffon](#marrhold_griffon_knights)<br />[Down the Valley](#marrhold_valley)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_winged_generals">Winged Generals</a><br />*It is said that two of a general’s most important traits are their eyes, with which they oversee the battlefield and react accordingly, and their voice, with which they command their troops to victory. Both things are way easier when you can just fly over the battle.\n\nWhilst many of our generals are already griffon riders in their own right, we will now make it mandatory, ensuring their skills are put to the best possible use.* | <li>army tradition is at least 40</li><li>has estate privilege estate_nobles_officer_corp</li><li>num of generals is at least 2</li> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_winged_generals until otherwise removed</li> | [The Royal Stables](#marrhold_stables)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_improvements">Room for Improvement</a><br />*Whilst our people have practised the art of griffon riding for more than a thousand years now, war itself is changing. New technological advancements and tactics have made all that we knew about warfare outdated, and if we want to assert ourselves in this new, chaotic Escann, it’s time to come up with advancements of our own.* | <li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is cavalry_power</li><li>value is at least 0.4</li></ul><li>barracks is at least 5</li> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_imagination for 20 years</li> | [Winged Generals](#marrhold_winged_generals)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_steel_bird">Steel Griffons</a><br />*Ever since the Greentide, firearms have become commonplace in the battlefields of Cannor. Initially, they were far too inaccurate and short-ranged to even dream to hit a flying target, but recently this has changed, and alongside mass fire, it poses a great threat to our legendary air charges.\n\nTo counteract this, we’ve developed a new lightweight steel plate armour for our winged mounts, which shall deflect most bullets and small projectiles, and ensure our knights remain as deadly as usual!* | <li>weapons is at least 3</li> | <li>clr country flag [unlocked_merc_marrhold_steel_griffon](../flags/unlocked_merc_marrhold_steel_griffon.md)</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_marrhold_steel_griffon</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Room for Improvement](#marrhold_improvements)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_screaming_eagles">Screaming Griffons</a><br />*The new armour has finally been developed, and it’s time for us to put it to the test. As artillery becomes more prevalent in war, they’ve also become the ideal targets: Stationary, valuable, and for the most part, defenseless. Let the enemy fear the sound of incoming, screaming, griffons!* | <li>army tradition is at least 60</li> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_no_surrender for 20 years</li> | [Steel Griffons](#marrhold_steel_bird)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_winged_army">The Winged Army</a><br />*After multiple reforms, we’ve finally fully incorporated griffons into our army, turning it into a formidable fighting force, operating on both land and air. These brave defenders of Marrhold shall make sure no enemy dares stand in our way.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army tradition is at least 60</li><li>army professionalism is at least 0.4</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_winged_army until otherwise removed</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = marrhold_winged_generals</li></ul> | [Battlefield Angels](#marrhold_angels)<br />[Screaming Griffons](#marrhold_screaming_eagles)<br />[Wings of Freedom](#marrhold_freedom)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_feather_academy">The Feather Academy</a><br />*In order for us to keep with the times, some in our court have requested royal patronage for the formation of the Feather Academy, which shall serve as a place of learning and science... And also develop new and innovative improvements for our army. History has taught us to always be at the ready, after all.* | <li>895:</li><ul><li>has building university</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army organiser is at least 3</li><li>army reformer is at least 3</li><li>commandant is at least 3</li><li>grand captain is at least 3</li><li>recruitmaster is at least 3</li><li>fortification expert is at least 3</li><li>quartermaster is at least 3</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_feather_academy for 25 years</li> | [The Winged Army](#marrhold_winged_army)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_sky_lancers">Sky Lancers</a><br />*Our experts have noted that, as a general trend, heavy cavalry has been largely phased out in the battlefields of Cannor. Whilst initially we refused to believe our Steel Griffons were becoming ineffective, the truth is that their added weight makes them slow, and as such, easy targets, whilst the armour that before made them impervious to attacks is now easily pierced.\n\nAs such, our generals have resolved to reform the Steel Griffons into a faster, more mobile unit of Sky Lancers, which shall harass the enemy’s rear, and be used for the purposes of shock tactics.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>treasury is at least 1500</li> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -1500</li><li>clr country flag [unlocked_merc_marrhold_steel_griffon](../flags/unlocked_merc_marrhold_steel_griffon.md)</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_marrhold_griffon_sky_lancers</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [The Feather Academy](#marrhold_feather_academy)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_aerial_supremacy">Lords of the Skies</a><br />*With great effort, our army stands now as one of the most professional and well-equipped in all of Cannor, which now dominates the skies. Anyone that dares threaten our home shall be met with the fury of our griffons, and the might and resolve of Marrodic men, ready to face all odds!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army tradition is at least 90</li><li>army professionalism is at least 0.6</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_sky_lords until otherwise removed</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = marrhold_winged_army</li></ul> | [Plan B](#marrhold_Plan_B)<br />[Sky Lancers](#marrhold_sky_lancers)<br />[From Scouts to Grenadiers](#marrhold_grenadiers)<br /> |

| <a name="marrhold_reclamation_day">Reclamation Day</a><br />*When the Greentide burst out of the mountains as a tide of destruction and barbarism, many in Escann chose to fight them head on, whilst we wisely retreated into our mountain to bide our time. The result? Our kingdom endures, whilst theirs have been reduced to rubble.\n\nNow, however, it is time for the men of Marrhold to sally forth from our hold, and reconquer the land that the foul Greenskins dare take from us. For Marrhold! For the Griffon Banner!* | <li>stability is at least 1</li><li>manpower percentage is at least 0.75</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "marrhold_reclamation" for 100 years</li><li>If dryadsdale area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If doewood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If hornwood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If esshyl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="marrhold_hills">Over the Hills</a><br />*Taken during the War of the Sorcerer-King, Esshyl is key to both the defense and the trade of our nation: Its hilly terrain makes for an excellent natural barrier against any would-be-invaders from the north, and the river Nath provides easy access to the markets downstream, all the way to the Silvermere. Thus, we need to regain control over it as soon as possible.* | <li>esshyl area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "colonial_enthusiasm" for 20 years</li><li>If esshyl area does not have culture is marrodic:</li><ul><li>change religion = ROOT</li><li>change culture = marrodic</li></ul> | [Reclamation Day](#marrhold_reclamation_day)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_taking_off">Taking Off</a><br />*The last few years have been full of hardship and rebuilding, but we’ve finally managed to restore the borders of our kingdom before the Greentide attacked!\n\nAs our people return to their homes, we find ourselves in a brand new Escann: One not dominated by chivalry, but instead upstart adventurers and vicious orcish tribes. Whatever the future may hold, our people shall endure, as we’ve done countless times before!* | <li>dryadsdale area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>culture is marrodic</li></ul><li>esshyl area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>culture is marrodic</li></ul><li>hornwood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>culture is marrodic</li></ul><li>doewood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>culture is marrodic</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_last_realm for 25 years</li> | [Over the Hills](#marrhold_hills)<br />[Through the Woods](#marrhold_woods)<br />[Down the Valley](#marrhold_valley)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_fresh_air">Fresh Air</a><br />*During the Greentide, we received thousands of refugees, initially from the rest of Escann, and later on, from Marrhold itself, as our borders came under orcish attack.\n\nWhilst we tried to accommodate them in our hold as best as possible, the truth is that it’s becoming a bit crowded. As such, we’ve decided to resettle them in the outskirts of our nation, in order to reinforce the borders.* | <li>dryadsdale area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul><li>esshyl area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul><li>hornwood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul><li>doewood area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>development is at least 6</li></ul> | <li>If does not have dlc is "Mandate of Heaven":</li><ul><li>If has monthly income is 50:</li><ul><li>add years of income = 1</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 500</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If has dryadsdale area has type is all, and dryadsdale area has owned by is root:</li><ul><li>dryadsdale area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 75</li></ul></ul><li>If has esshyl area has type is all, and esshyl area has owned by is root:</li><ul><li>esshyl area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 75</li></ul></ul><li>If has hornwood area has type is all, and hornwood area has owned by is root:</li><ul><li>hornwood area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 75</li></ul></ul><li>If has doewood area has type is all, and doewood area has owned by is root:</li><ul><li>doewood area:</li><ul><li>add prosperity = 75</li></ul></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_back_fields for 20 years</li> | [Taking Off](#marrhold_taking_off)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_chance">Seize the Chance</a><br />*Now that stability has returned, our nation looks outwards: We are the only remaining kingdom in the area, now that all others have fallen, and some even claim we are the only proper nation in the entirety of Escann, as opposed to adventurers and orcs.\n\nIndeed, we are in a prime position to enforce our dominance over the region.* | <li>army size is at least 25</li><li>cavalry fraction is at least 0.25</li> | <li>If swapstoke area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If nortessord area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If medirleigh area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Fresh Air](#marrhold_fresh_air)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_alenic_indeed">'Alenic', indeed!</a><br />*Ever since our people migrated into Escann, we’ve taken great pride in our Alenic roots. Through the centuries, we’ve kept our traditions and culture, despite the pressure from the outside world.\n\nNow it’s time for us to act upon these roots, and seize the birthplace of the river that is our namesake!* | <li>nortessord area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If oldhaven area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If sarwood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_new_crowns for 20 years</li> | [Seize the Chance](#marrhold_chance)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_dominance">Assert Our Dominance</a><br />*In the past, our kingdom has been at times vassal of first Castanor, and later on Castellyr. However, now Castellyr lies in ruins, it being taken over by greenskins, adventurers and the remnants of the Counts League.\n\nThis makes it so now are the ones in a position to subjugate them, instead. Let this be the definitive triumph of the Griffon over the Silver Dragon!* | <li>oldhaven area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>sarwood area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>If coalwoud area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If ardent glade area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If steelhyl area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If clouded wood area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | ['Alenic', indeed!](#marrhold_alenic_indeed)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_survey_corps">The Survey Corps</a><br />*Many in our military staff have suggested the formation of a brand new military organisation inside our realm: the Survey Corps, a core of professional soldiers focused on reconnaissance and fast movement, to complement our regular armies.\n\nLet’s fund this initiative, and ensure our armies are never again outmaneuvered!* | <li>manpower is at least 10</li><li>880:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add manpower = -5</li><li>unlock merc company:</li><ul><li>merc company = merc_marrhold_griffon_survey</li><li>free merc = yes</li></ul> | [Room for Improvement](#marrhold_improvements)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_freedom">Wings of Freedom</a><br />*After the Survey Corps was established, we’ve realised another boon it offers: It gives ambitious soldiers and officers an excellent opportunity to prove themselves.\n\nAs such, we will make sure it’s leadership is in the hands of the best commanders of Marrhold, so that the next generation of warriors benefits from their experience, as well.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>years of income is at least 0.5</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army reformer is at least 2</li><li>commandant is at least 2</li><li>grand captain is at least 2</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add years of income = -0.5</li><li>country gets the modifier marrhold_glory for 20 years</li> | [The Survey Corps](#marrhold_survey_corps)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_deepwoods_start">A Shadow Over the Forest</a><br />*Now that we have achieved dominance over Southern Escann, a new opportunity has presented itself: To our south lies the Deepwoods, a magical forest full of trickster fey and other malevolent spirits.\n\nTo ensure the safety of our people, we shall push back the border a few miles, so that the dark wilderness may never again threaten our realm! * | <li>clirypriah area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul><li>prehnryn area:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_vietnam for 20 years</li><li>If east deepwoods region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If west deepwoods region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Griffon Has Landed](#marrhold_griffon_has_landed)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_feybane">Beastbane Had the Right Idea</a><br />*Some dare call our conquest of the Deepwoods a fool’s errand, claiming that no human army would be able to conquer the enchanted forest. Yet, they seem to forget that the greatest Castan of all, Castan Beastbane, waged war against the forest itself and won thousands of years ago!\n\nWe are no lesser than the ancient castanites, and as such we shall tame the Deepwoods for the benefit of Marrhold and for all of Escann!* | <li>east deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>west deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier marrhold_woods for 25 years</li> | [A Shadow Over the Forest](#marrhold_deepwoods_start)<br /> |
| <a name="marrhold_apex_predator">Apex Predator</a><br />*Now that we have control over the entirety of the Deepwoods, the hard work commences: To tame these lands, so that they’re useful to our realm. We shall show the inhabitants of the forest that the griffon is now the apex predator of the woods, and that opposing our civilised rule is futile.* | <li>west deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul><li>east deepwoods region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>unrest is at least 1</li><li>nationalism is at least 1</li></ul></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = marrhold_deepwoods_dev</li><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is west deepwoods region, and has region is east deepwoods region; and  has trade goods is tropical wood, and  has owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 3</li></ul></ul> | [Beastbane Had the Right Idea](#marrhold_feybane)<br /> |
