| <a name="deranne_recover_from_lilac_wars">Recover from the Lilac Wars</a><br />*Due to the marriage between the Damerian heir, Adénn Skylance, and Calassa of Deranne, the duchy fought against its nominal overlord, the King of Lorent, during the Lilac Wars. The war ended in disaster as Adénn and his forces were stuck on the other side of the Dameshead for much of the final war, leaving Deranne and its Wine Lord allies alone against the behemoth that is Lorent.* | <li>stability is at least 2</li> | <li>country gets the modifier "building_spree" for 25 years</li> |  |
| <a name="deranne_the_march_of_ording">The March of Ording</a><br />*Having seized West Ording during the Lilac Wars, we have left a poor impression on the so-called "Great Ording." Regardless, the land is good and offers a buffer against a resurgent Lorent and the upstart Damerian traitors* | <li>75:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>92:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = 200</li><li>add army tradition = 25</li><li>add mil power = 25</li><li>add adm power = 25</li><li>add dip power = 25</li><li>If northern flats area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Recover from the Lilac Wars](#deranne_recover_from_lilac_wars)<br />[The Winelords](#deranne_the_winelords)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_militarization_of_the_march">Militarization of the March</a><br />*It was one thing to take the march. It is another entirely to actually make into a bastion capable of repelling hostile armies, and to provide crack troops to our armies.* | <li>treasury is at least 50</li><li>owns core province 102</li><li>owns core province  75</li><li>owns core province   92</li><li>75:</li><ul><li>development is at least 15</li></ul><li>92:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul><li>102:</li><ul><li>development is at least 10</li></ul> | <li>If darom area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>add treasury = -50</li><li>add manpower = 2.5</li><li>country gets the modifier "thriving_arms_industry" for 25 years</li><li>75:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "bulwark_fortifications"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The March of Ording](#deranne_the_march_of_ording)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_secure_darom">Secure Darom</a><br />*Named after the Lenco-Damerian warlord Daromas, Darom has often been the military stronghold in western Lencenor. The area is divided amongst various squabbling lords, but as rulers of Daromsfort we must exert our claim across the area once more.* | <li>darom area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If shrouded coast area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Militarization of the March](#deranne_militarization_of_the_march)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_into_the_shrouded_coast">Into the Shrouded Coast</a><br />*There's not much to the Shrouded Coast other than mist and wetness - but holding it is crucial if we are to dominate the western coast of Lencenor.* | <li>shrouded coast area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If sorncost vines area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure Darom](#deranne_secure_darom)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_land_of_the_southern_wine">Land of the Southern Wine</a><br />*Sornbay has always been seen as the better brother of Westport, but no longer. If we bring this city and the rest of Sorncóst proper to our control we can further expand the ambitions of Westport.* | <li>sorncost vines area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "hegemonic_ambition" for 25 years</li> | [Into the Shrouded Coast](#deranne_into_the_shrouded_coast)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_new_adea_naval_school_mission">New Adea Naval School</a><br />*The Shrouded Coast was never particularly rich in resources. It is, however, located on a strategic waterway, with easy access to inland seas, the coasts of all Southern Cannor, and the open waves of the Lament (and their trade routes). By investing some of top talent and embracing our sea-faring traditions, we can take full advantage of this.* | <li>treasury is at least 350</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>82:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has building drydock</li><li>has building  grand_shipyard</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -350</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>82:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "deranne_new_adea_naval_school_prov"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>country gets the modifier "deranne_new_adea_naval_school" until otherwise removed</li> | [Land of the Southern Wine](#deranne_land_of_the_southern_wine)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_hegemony_of_lencenor">Hegemony of Southern Lencenor</a><br />*With the defeat of the regional powers and the gutting of Lorent, little remains in our way to seize the rest of southwest Lencenor. None can stand before our armies, and it is time the last of those who dare to pay fealty to the crown.* | <li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>sornhills area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>lower winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 100</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>country gets the modifier "deranne_southern_hegemony" until otherwise removed</li> | [The Wine of Deranne](#deranne_reaver_wine)<br /> |

| <a name="deranne_seaflower_knights">Seaflower Knights</a><br />*While the foppish and bloated Rose Knights concern themselves with courtly intrigue and chasing Roilsardi dames, our Seaflower Knights live a hardy life as both equestrian chevaliers and marine officers. They are fewer than their Lorentish counterparts, but are more than a match for anything they can throw at us!* | <li>num of cavalry is at least 6</li> | <li>add army tradition = 10</li><li>country gets the modifier "deranne_seaflower_knights_mod" for 25 years</li> | [Recover from the Lilac Wars](#deranne_recover_from_lilac_wars)<br />[The Winelords](#deranne_the_winelords)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_secure_upper_winebay">Secure Upper Winebay</a><br />*Thanks to our marital ties much of the Upper Winebay is in fact part of the personal demesne of the Duke of Deranne... except Oldport. If we are to expand our naval ambitions we should capture the historical naval port of Lencenor, and more importantly, the mouth that feeds Lorentainé.* | <li>upper winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "merchant_navy" for 15 years</li><li>add dip power = 100</li><li>add mercantilism = 5</li> | [Seaflower Knights](#deranne_seaflower_knights)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_fortify_winebay">Fortification of Casthíl</a><br />*With Oldport secured, Casthíl has become more important than ever in the defense of our eastern holdings. We must invest ourselves into its defence, and make it a bastion capable of holding off eve magic (for a time). This will allow our troops the time they need to embark, and will assist us greatly in regards to our Bloodwine ambitions...* | <li>73:</li><ul><li>fort level is at least 2</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>73:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "deranne_winebay_bastion"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add mil power = 50</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>If lower bloodwine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Secure Upper Winebay](#deranne_secure_upper_winebay)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_bloody_wine">Bloody Wine</a><br />*Our holdings in the Upper Winebay are separated from Deranne proper by the Lower Bloodwine region, partitioned as it is between the petty Winelords. We should introduce this rich region to our take on "Lorentish Red," something our Reaver heritage will no doubt appreciate.* | <li>lower bloodwine area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier "army_enthusiasm" for 25 years</li> | [Fortification of Casthíl](#deranne_fortify_winebay)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_reaver_wine">The Wine of Deranne</a><br />*With our newfound control over much of the wine production in Lencenor, we can shake up the old ways of making it, and put our own spin on it. We'll show the Lencori how to make a *real* beverage, with some influence from our Reaver past; Derannic Blood Wine will be the drink of all Cannor!* | <li>wine is at least 7</li> | <li>add years of income = -.5</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>If random owned province has trade goods is wine:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "deranne_reaver_wine_mod"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is wine:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "deranne_reaver_wine_mod"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If random owned province has trade goods is wine:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "deranne_reaver_wine_mod"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Bloody Wine](#deranne_bloody_wine)<br />[Land of the Southern Wine](#deranne_land_of_the_southern_wine)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_breadbasket_of_southroy">Breadbasket of Southroy</a><br />*The land of Southroy has always acted as a buffer march, protecting us from the north. However, it is comprised of quite arable land and, with the right investment, could be developed to feed and house many.* | <li>southroy area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>123:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>124:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>125:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul><li>128:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Gateway to the West](#deranne_gateway_to_the_west)<br /> |
| <a name="deranne_army_of_deranne">Army of Deranne</a><br />*By necessity, our army has faced trials and tribulations, against the Winelords, the Reavers, the gnomes, the Lorentish, across the world in our colonial holdings, and whatever comes next. Our army has hardened itself through these ordeals, but it must be made ever harder, ready at a moment's notice to defeat any foe, and defend the interests of Deranne.* | <li>treasury is at least 400</li><li>mil power is at least 150</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>army size is at least 80</li> | <li>add treasury = -400</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -150</li><li>country gets the modifier "deranne_army_of_deranne_mod" until otherwise removed</li> | [Breadbasket of Southroy](#deranne_breadbasket_of_southroy)<br /> |

| <a name="deranne_the_winelords">The Winelords</a><br />*The Winelords sided with House Silmuna against Lorent in the Lilac Wars. With House Silmuna's deposition, they are short on allies, but nonetheless refuse to submit to the Lorentish Siloriels. As the greatest of the Winelords, it falls to us to assume leadership of this impromptu coalition and secure ourselves from Lorentish aggression* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Rubenaire</li><li>A18:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A18:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is rival is Rubenaire</li><li>A18:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is insulted</li></ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is scornfully_insulted</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Eilisin</li><li>A15:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A15:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is rival is Eilisin</li><li>A15:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is insulted</li></ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is scornfully_insulted</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Wineport</li><li>A16:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>is subject</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>A16:</li><ul><li>alliance with is this nation</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>is rival is Wineport</li><li>A16:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is insulted</li></ul><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>modifier is scornfully_insulted</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>country gets the modifier "influential_diplomacy" for 25 years</li> |  |

Forced out of their homes in the Dragon Coast long ago, they migrated south. With the help of our colonial holdings, we are now in a much better position to help the gnomes find a new "home," far away from the dastardly kobolds.
