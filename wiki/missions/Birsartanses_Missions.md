| <a name="F21_reclaim_the_north">Reclaim the North</a><br />*Aqatbahar has fallen to a goblin invasion, while we were unable to take the city in the past. This shame must be rectified.

| <a name="F21_end_the_rivalry">End the Rivalry</a><br />*Our relatives ruling over Azka-Evran have always been the inferior branch of the family. Their loss of Aqatbahar to the Marblehead goblins only proved the point.\n\nStill, they were an irritant and rival to our rule of Bahar for long enough. It is time to end this rivalry - definitively.* | <li>azka evran area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If medbahar area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If tungr mountains area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>the event [The Sack of Azka-Evran](../events/the_sack_of_azka_evran.md) happens</li> | [Reclaim the North](#F21_reclaim_the_north)<br /> |
| <a name="F21_dinatoldir_scepter">A Supreme Scepter</a><br />*The spear Dinatoldir was wielded by Jaher himself during the liberation of of Bulwar and his Halessi Campaigns where it was broken. He nonetheless gave the remaining pieces to the governor of Imuluses, Amarien, who then divided the spear between her two sons Birzartan and Eletar.\n\nNow that we have recovered our rightful inheritance from Azka-Evran we could reforge the spear. However, the time of heroes is over, and the time of statesmen and strategists has begun. The spear could better serve us as a symbol - a scepter - to show our power and legitimacy.* | <li>has country modifier shaft_of_dinatoldir</li><li>has country modifier  spearhead_of_dinatoldir</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>damestear is at least 1</li><li>any subject country:</li><ul><li>damestear is at least 1</li></ul><li>trading bonus:</li><ul><li>trade goods is damestear</li><li>country has this</li></ul></ul><li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li></ul> | <li>the event [The Bringer of Light](../events/the_bringer_of_light.md) happens</li> | [End the Rivalry](#F21_end_the_rivalry)<br /> |

| <a name="F21_end_the_rebellion">End the Rebellion</a><br />*Since self-proclaimed Akal, Dartaxes szel-Forramaz, incited a rebellion in our northern provinces, his rebellion spread along the Saluraš river and even took the city of Akal-Uak. The traitorous general must be brought to heel, before the heresy of the Old Sun Cult spreads further.

| <a name="F21_ordalanner">The Ordalanner</a><br />*By producing ever larger and more sophisticated artillery pieces, such as the Ordalanner, we will be able to decimate our enemies with superior firepower.

| <a name="F21_integrate_dwarves">Integrate Dwarves</a><br />*Only by integrating the different races residing in our state, and using them where their specific abilities fit best, can we increase the efficiency of our state even further. As such, we should establish a dwarven administrative division and coordinate the deployment of dwarfs in mines and industries, where they work most efficiently.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li><li>has owner accepted culture</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is copper_dwarf</li></ul><li>high tolerance dwarven race trigger is yes</li> | <li>custom tooltip = birsartanses_upgrade_cultural_efficiency_tt</li><li>If has country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 3:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = F21_cultural_efficiency_3</li><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_4 until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>Else if has country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 2:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = F21_cultural_efficiency_2</li><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_3 until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>Else if has country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 1:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = F21_cultural_efficiency_1</li><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_2 until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>Else if does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 1, and does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 2, and does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 3, and does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 4:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_1 until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [The Ordalanner](#F21_ordalanner)<br />[A Sun Elven State](#F21_sun_elven_state)<br /> |

Therefore, we should instead further integrate and use them. By nature, their involvement in courier services and scouting will allow our administration to function more efficiently. They might also work as entertainers or hostesses at the various feasts often held by our nobility.* | <li>any owned province:</li><ul><li>culture group is harpy</li><li>has owner accepted culture</li></ul><li>employed advisor:</li><ul><li>culture is firanyan_harpy</li></ul><li>high tolerance harpy race trigger is yes</li> | <li>custom tooltip = birsartanses_upgrade_cultural_efficiency_tt</li><li>If has country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 3:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = F21_cultural_efficiency_3</li><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_4 until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>Else if has country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 2:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = F21_cultural_efficiency_2</li><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_3 until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>Else if has country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 1:</li><ul><li>remove country modifier = F21_cultural_efficiency_1</li><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_2 until otherwise removed</li></ul><li>Else if does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 1, and does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 2, and does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 3, and does not have country modifier is F21 cultural efficiency 4:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier F21_cultural_efficiency_1 until otherwise removed</li></ul> | [Integrate Dwarves](#F21_integrate_dwarves)<br />[Examination System](#F21_examination_system)<br /> |

| <a name="F21_true_capital">Centralize the Administration</a><br />*After the disasters of the last decades, it has become clear that the traditional ways of administering a country have become obsolete. Only by modernizing and centralizing the administration we will be able to streamline processes, control and regulate policies and detect corruption more easily and quickly. This will however require the establishment of the necessary local infrastructure in the capital.* | <li>owns core province 549</li><li>549:</li><ul><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has tax building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>549:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = paper</li><li>change culture = sun_elf</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = F21_central_administration</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="F21_educate_officials">Educate the Officials</a><br />*The feudal system as it is does not require our nobility to excel in administration and governance. It doesn't even require an education on these matters.

| <a name="F21_sun_elven_state">A Sun Elven State</a><br />*The role of the sun elves has long been one of the most important questions of religious and administrative importance in our country. While our government and administration is and shall stay dominated by sun elves, the exclusion of other races, especially the plentiful humans, is not the most efficient use of our population. The use of talents from other races should be considered carefully in the future.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>has dlc "Mandate of Heaven"</li></ul><li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is province_is_prosperous</li><li>is prosperous</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>stability is at least 2</li></ul><li>total development is at least 300</li><li>has adm advisor 2 yes</li><li>has dip advisor 2 yes</li><li>has mil advisor 2 yes</li> | <li>If has government is monarchy:</li><ul><li>add government reform = birsartanses_central_administration_1</li></ul><li>the event [Human Administrators](../events/human_administrators.md) happens</li> | [Calm the Waves](#F21_calm_the_waves)<br />[Educate the Officials](#F21_educate_officials)<br /> |
| <a name="F21_examination_system">Examination System</a><br />*Most elven administrations populate their bureaucracy by relying on the aristocracy, recruited via privileged connections with the rulers and, of course, hereditary connections. This inevitably leads to corruption, notably among the Sun Elves, for a bad bureaucrat could remain at his post for centuries and deeply erode the proper running of the state.\n\nFollowing the Decades of Devastation and the revelation of many Sun Elven bureaucrats' mistakes and misconduct, Keladora I Birzartanzuir decided to revive the Jexisian system of examination that was the work of her grandfather Birzartan: Administration posts would be awarded only to those who could prove they were worthy of the position. They would do so by passing an examination that was the same for everybody, everywhere in the kingdom.\n\nThe new class of bureaucrats was still predominantly elven and from the old aristocracy, for only they could spend entire years studying for the examinations, but the testing process allowed the state to remove the corrupt and unsuitable administrators that had plagued it.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul><li>has adm advisor 3 yes</li><li>has dip advisor 3 yes</li><li>has mil advisor 3 yes</li><li>monthly adm is at least 12</li> | <li>custom tooltip = birsartanses_upgrade_government_tt</li><li>If has government is monarchy:</li><ul><li>add government reform = birsartanses_central_administration_2</li></ul> | [A Sun Elven State](#F21_sun_elven_state)<br /> |
| <a name="F21_enact_plans">The 25-Year Plan</a><br />*After the establishment of the examination system it became common for even the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take part in the exams from time to time. This involvement has gone so far that our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] is now expected to produce a treatise on the future of the state every 25 years. This treatise is then examined by the intellectual elite of the nation and a administrative plan for the next 25 years is established on its basis. Should the treatise however not suffice in quality to serve as such a basis, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s legitimacy and support among the administration would certainly take a hit.* | <li>ADM is at least 5</li><li>549:</li><ul><li>development is at least 40</li></ul><li>has reform birsartanses_central_administration_2</li><li>has adm advisor 4 yes</li><li>has dip advisor 4 yes</li><li>has mil advisor 4 yes</li> | <li>custom tooltip = birsartanses_enact_plans_tt</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [birsartanses_plans_enacted](../flags/birsartanses_plans_enacted.md)</li></ul> | [Examination System](#F21_examination_system)<br /> |
