| <a name="A60_invest_ravenhill">Invest in Ravenhill</a><br />*Currently, we do not have many great sources of income. However, the city of Ravenhill, located on the edge of the swamp, has many opportunities for those willing to take a chance.

| <a name="A60_rolling_the_dice">Rolling the Dice</a><br />*While Ravenhill is a prosperous city in its own right, it tends to have a high crime rate, and also has the problem of the encroaching swamp. We might be able to solve both these problems at once. The debtors are desperate for a way out of their situation. We will consider their debt paid if they go out into the swamp and aid in the resettlement.* | <li>431:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 16</li></ul><li>444:</li><ul><li>owned by is Asheniande</li></ul><li>443:</li><ul><li>owned by is Asheniande</li></ul><li>442:</li><ul><li>owned by is Asheniande</li></ul> | <li>444:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>443:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>442:</li><ul><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>daravans folly region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Gambler's Paradise](#A60_gamblers_paradise)<br /> |

| <a name="A60_investigate_curse">Investigate the Curse</a><br />*In the year 669 the southern half of the Korbarid Kingdom was flooded by the Mage King Daravan in order to ensure the survival of the rest of the kingdom.

| <a name="A60_rebuild_rivers">Rebuild River Trade</a><br />*The Karnvord River has served as the perfect channel of trade into the heart of Corvuria, and along with the smaller rivers around it makes for a perfect system of trade routs across the region. Putting these rivers to use will restore the economic activity of the region, but it will take some effort.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier corvuria_folly1</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 50</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -50</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>country gets the modifier corvuria_folly2 for 10 years</li> | [Investigate the Curse](#A60_investigate_curse)<br /> |

| <a name="A60_healing_folly">Healing the Folly</a><br />*We are unsure if the Folly shall ever be as prosperous as it once was, but we do know that with great effort,  the union of our peoples will always preserve. It may take decades or even more centuries for the wounds of the land to truly heal, but the Corvurian and Ashenianden people are tough enough to see it through.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier corvuria_folly3</li></ul><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add prestige = 30</li><li>If has owns is 431:</li><ul><li>431:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = corvuria_folly_healing</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>If daravans folly region does not have province id is 451:</li><ul><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base production = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = corvuria_folly_healing</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = corvuria_not_nathalaire</li><li>country gets the modifier corvuria_folly4 until otherwise removed</li> | [Repopulating the Folly](#A60_repopulate_folly)<br /> |

| <a name="A60_redistricting_ravenhill">Redistricting Ravenhill</a><br />*Ravenhill, for centuries, has been a border city on the edge of a dark swamp, filled with less reputable members of society. It had to adapt to its position, and thus the city itself has a strange, lopsided layout and setup. Now, Ravenhill finds itself in a central position, surrounded by newly founded farmland and villages. Due to its considerable size already, it will likely become a major urban hub of the region. And thus, as it had to adapt to the swamp in ages past, it must adapt once more to what it shall become. We will redistrict the city, and hopefully turn it into the shining star of the region. First, we will need to make the city much more attractive to the upper class...* | <li>431:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>treasury is at least 300</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -300</li><li>add adm power = -100</li><li>431:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = ravenhill_gambling_revenue2</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "ravenhill_redistrict"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>add estate loyalty modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>desc = ravenhill_highclass</li><li>loyalty = 10</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul><li>add estate loyalty modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_burghers</li><li>desc = ravenhill_highclass</li><li>loyalty = 10</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul> | [Newfound Farmland](#A60_newfound_farmland)<br /> |
| <a name="A60_relocate_government">The Ravenhill Question</a><br />*The redistricting of the city was a success and the city is starting to grow to great heights.

| <a name="A60_ravenhill_cabaret">Ravenhill Cabaret</a><br />*As Ravenhill develops a new, distinct upper class of merchants and nobles, a new interesting cultural development has occurred. Cabaret Cafes have started popping up in the new districts, where the rich go for fine dining and entertainment. Parallel to this, the proprietors of the gambling establishments that previously existed in Ravenhill have started building Counterparts in the high-class districts, because the only thing better than poor people gambling is rich people gambling* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>dip power is at least 50</li><li>431:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has building trade_depot</li><li>has building  stock_exchange</li></ul><li>has courthouse building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>add dip power = -50</li><li>431:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "ravenhill_cabaret_buff"</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Ravenhill Question](#A60_relocate_government)<br /> |
| <a name="A60_central_capital">The Central Metropolis</a><br />*Ravenhill continues to grow ever larger, and is the largest city in Dostanor. In it, the aristocracy mingles with eachother while merchants gather from across Dostanor and the area surrounding Ravenhill, before either departing, either further into the Empire, or down the Dostanesck. The Commoners and the rich alike gather in gambling houses still, while artisans produce their myriad goods all throughout the city. Truly, Ravenhill is a shining metropolis that marvels and even surpasses some of the greatest cities in the empire.* | <li>431:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 40</li></ul> | <li>If central corvuria area does not have province id is 431:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "the_central_capital"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>428:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "the_central_capital"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>430:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "the_central_capital"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>440:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "the_central_capital"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul><li>443:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = "the_central_capital"</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul></ul> | [Ravenhill Cabaret](#A60_ravenhill_cabaret)<br /> |
