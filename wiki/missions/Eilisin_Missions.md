| <a name="A15_the_inevitable">The Inevitable</a><br />*Our armies may be haggard and worn from the Lilac Wars but they are still strong and brave and keen to get revenge on our enemies. Still, we will need to increase recruitment and training, and spread good news to the people. Remind them that they should be proud to be in Eilísin and to fight for our continued independence. We will not be defeated again!* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>war with is Lorent</li><li>is year is at least 1465</li></ul> | <li>add mil power = 50</li><li>country gets the modifier army_enthusiasm for 5 years</li> |  |
| <a name="A15_end_charade">End the Charade</a><br />*The Dukes of Rubenaire pretend at being powerful and important since they were on the winning side of the Lilac Wars. Their betrayal however, has not been forgotten and its time has come due. Rubenaire will be ours in payment for turning their backs on us.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>num of allies is at least 3</li><li>is rival is Rubenaire</li></ul> | <li>If southern flats area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>108:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Fate of the Minarans](#A15_fate_of_minar)<br />[The Inevitable](#A15_the_inevitable)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_those_who_left">Those who Left</a><br />*Now that the core Rubenairi lands are ours, we can finally rest easy knowing those traitors have been punished. And as a bonus we now control the source of Rubenaire Red and the famous Rubenaire University, and all the brilliant minds contained therein.* | <li>southern flats area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>108:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier eilisin_rubenaire_uni for 10 years</li> | [End the Charade](#A15_end_charade)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_greater_twin">The Greater Twin</a><br />*With our control of Rubenaire and the Minara Temple, we now have more lands in the Bay than our ‘twin’ Duchy Madelaire. It is time we showed them that we are not equals as our colloquial titles would suggest but that Eilísin is the superior sister.* | <li>total development is Madelaire</li><li>total development  is Wesdam</li><li>78:</li><ul><li>num of times improved is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A14</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul><li>If lower bloodwine area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>105:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Those who Left](#A15_those_who_left)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_stolen_inheritance">Our Stolen Inheritance</a><br />*That fool Laurens II should have known to give the county of Horsegarden to Eilís in the first place. Instead she had to wrench Greatfield from him and make do with that. Such an insult can finally be corrected however as we finally control Horsegarden. It will be clear for all to see that our claims will be secured.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 105</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  114</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eilisin_claimed_full_inheritance for 15 years</li> | [The Greater Twin](#A15_greater_twin)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_shadow_over_lencenor">A Shadow over Lencenor</a><br />*Our old enemy, Lorent, has stood as a shining mountain of strength in Lencenor for so long. Its armies seemingly unbeatable, its coffers seemingly bottomless. However there is a new power rising here, a dark rose is growing in the south, curling its thorns around the Bay of Wines and it now threatens Lorent’s position. It won’t be long now before the thorns start spreading north.* | <li>army size is Lorent</li><li>total development is Lorent</li> | <li>67:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Our Stolen Inheritance](#A15_stolen_inheritance)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_storm_the_court">Storming the Court</a><br />*Many years ago Eilís stormed the court of her father Laurens, demanding her claim to the County of Horsegarden be acknowledged.\n\nEilísin has secured the loyalty of the Wine Lords, and much of Lencenor now bows to us, and yet still there are those who do not acknowledge our claim to be the rightful rulers of Lorent. We should follow after the example set by Eilís and storm the court Lorentainé forcing [A01.Monarch.GetName] to acknowledge our rightful claim over all of Lencenor.* | <li>67:</li><ul><li>controlled by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>If lencenor region does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [A Shadow over Lencenor](#A15_shadow_over_lencenor)<br /> |

| <a name="A15_bring_calas_home">Bring Calas Home</a><br />*40 years ago, Calas of Eilísin left just before the Third Lilac War with many of our number to fight for the Order of the Ashen Rose in Escann in order to defeat the Greentide. It seems, now that Dookanson is dead, they see no reason to stay with the Order, preferring to return home. Some among us, who have seen too many betrayals in the Lilac Wars, are suspicious of this. But quite frankly, we need the men with our reserves being as they are.* | <li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 100</li> | <li>If has exists is A10:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>target = A10</li><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 300</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>97:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul><li>the event [Calas Returns?](../events/calas_returns.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="A15_fate_of_minar">Fate of the Minarans</a><br />*Though these are the lands of Minara, her worship has been dwindling among the nobles and merchants until only we have remained, as in so many other ways, loyal. And yet, in some twisted turn of fate, the Temple of Minara itself has decided that perhaps it should be Wineport who protects them. Wineport, whose merchant lords care only for money and do not even worship Minara! Well, we’ll set this right and see to it that the Temple is protected by us, the truly devout!* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 97</li> | <li>81:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul><li>101:</li><ul><li>If does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul></ul> | [Bring Calas Home](#A15_bring_calas_home)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_close_wineport">Close the Wine-port</a><br />*The merchant lords of Wineport have always been a scheming thorn in our side. With our recently being appointed Minara’s Fist by the Temple, we have been given the duty of protecting all of the Minari. With this claim at our disposal, it is time we took control of the Wineport and extended our protection of the Temple to their faithful as well.* | <li>owns or non sovereign subject of 81</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  101</li> | <li>If eastern winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If lower winebay area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Fate of the Minarans](#A15_fate_of_minar)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_clenched_fist">Clench the Fist</a><br />*With the Wineport firmly under our protection, it is time we turned our attention to the rest of the Bay. Our holdings in Carneteria are a perfect place to stage an invasion of Saloren and the Eastern territories of the Bay. Saloren, the sad successor of once noble Roilsard, is the last major lord who rules over the Minari. As her faithful’s protectors we must intervene to make sure they do not fall to the likes of Lorent or someone in the Empire.* | <li>eastern winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>lower winebay area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier eilisin_closed_fist until otherwise removed</li> | [Close the Wine-port](#A15_close_wineport)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_new_wing">A New Wing</a><br />*With our control of the Rubenaire University and our growing population of mages drawn to us by our efforts with transmutation magic in our fields, we find ourselves in need of a proper place for them to operate from. The best option for us would be a state-run entity so that we have full control over the comings and going of our mages. We will need a wing in the palace for this of course, to allow them space to perform their research away from the eyes of those who needn’t know of it.* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>has estate privilege estate_mages_organization_state</li><li>owns 79</li> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>79:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eilisin_mage_wing_construction</li><li>duration = 5475</li></ul></ul> | [Non-stop Growth](#A15_non_stop_growth)<br />[Those who Left](#A15_those_who_left)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_prying_eyes">Away from Prying Eyes</a><br />*With the new wing complete our mages now have a safe and secure place to study. Because it is within our walls and funded by us, they will make sure to prioritize what we want them to study over their own projects, but they don’t seem to have a problem with that since we reduced the confines of the rules regulating their research.* | <li>owns 79</li><li>79:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier eilisin_mage_wing_construction</li></ul></ul><li>has estate privilege estate_mages_reduced_research_regulations</li> | <li>custom tooltip = eilisin_better_reduced_regulations</li><li>set country flag [reduced_dip_from_regulations](../flags/reduced_dip_from_regulations.md)</li><li>country gets the modifier eilisin_mage_wing until otherwise removed</li> | [A New Wing](#A15_new_wing)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_reshaping_the_world">Reshaping the World</a><br />*A group of our mage scholars have found a way to overcome the problems of over-transmuting our soil. Without time to recover, the land simply doesn’t have the energy to keep up and so it slowly drains until there is nothing left. However, this group has suggested transferring life essence straight into the land itself. This will take an extraordinary amount of power and control. Thankfully, there are ways to get that kind of power.* | <li>ruler has mage personality is yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>manpower is at least 1</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tooltip_has_transmutation_3</li><li>has ruler flag [transmutation_3](../flags/transmutation_3.md)</li></ul></ul> | <li>If does not have ruler flag is [transmutation_3](../flags/transmutation_3.md):</li><ul><li>add manpower = -1</li><li>magic study level up transmutation = yes</li><li>increase witch king points small = yes</li></ul><li>set country flag [better_plant_growth](../flags/better_plant_growth.md)</li> | [Away from Prying Eyes](#A15_prying_eyes)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_a_budding_rose">A Budding Rose</a><br />*We have put some measures in place to ensure that our line will from now on always be married to noble mages with talent for Transmutation. Between that and a mandatory focus of study on transmutation for all future members of the house of síl Eilísin we will have guaranteed that the knowledge to keep our fields growing is passed on and strengthened through every generation.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>heir has mage personality is yes</li><li>has country modifier heir_mage_personality_mod</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>set country flag [add_transmutation_1_point](../flags/add_transmutation_1_point.md)</li><li>country gets the modifier eilisin_trained_heirs until otherwise removed</li> | [Reshaping the World](#A15_reshaping_the_world)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_dark_rose_blooms">The Dark Rose Blooms</a><br />*The time has finally come for the Dark Rose to bloom. Our ruler is known and feared far and wide as a Witch-King, willing to use any means necessary to achieve their goals and ambitions. Our fields are fueled with life essence and blood and our cups runneth over with wine and wealth aplenty. The nobility have long been usurped by loyal mages of note within our state, their power growing alongside ours, and the people will not contest us.* | <li>lencenor region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>has ruler modifier witch_king_modifier</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eilisin_dark_rose_blooms until otherwise removed</li> | [A Budding Rose](#A15_a_budding_rose)<br />[Storming the Court](#A15_storm_the_court)<br /> |

| <a name="A15_replant_the_fields">Replant the Fields</a><br />*With the Lilac Wars finally over, we can begin the replanting effort. This will take a long time but it must be done as soon as possible, else our fields will never catch up with the devastation wrought by the near century of war. The farmers have been given a stipend of sorts to rebuild their lands as have the merchants and workers in the cities. With new workshops and wineries opening daily, it won’t be long before we’ve not only recovered, but overtaken, our previous prosperity of so many decades ago.* | <li>79:</li><ul><li>base production is at least 10</li><li>has production building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>79:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eilisin_replanted_fields</li><li>duration = 9125</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="A15_strengthen_the_bloodlines">Strengthen the Bloodline</a><br />*While some to this day remain wary of magically inclined rulers, they don’t say ‘Magic knows best’ for nothing. Magical blood not only carries the obvious benefit of magic, it also makes you haler and grants some limited longevity. These are all qualities that the house of síl Eilísin will need if we are to grow with our vineyards.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>has reform magical_elite_reform</li><li>owns 79</li> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_mages</li><li>share = 5</li></ul><li>79:</li><ul><li>add base production = 2</li></ul> | [Crush the Rebels](#A15_crush_the_rebels)<br />[Replant the Fields](#A15_replant_the_fields)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_non_stop_growth">Non-stop Growth</a><br />*Some say that magic begets magic. Our extensive use of magic to grow our fields has led to more mages seeking to participate which in turn allows us to use more magic. This wonderful cycle is doing wonders for our production quotas but some say that this cannot last. Well, what do they know?* | <li>79:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_1</li><li>has province modifier  magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_2</li><li>has province modifier   magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_3</li></ul></ul> | <li>79:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eilisin_1</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>the event [A Warning from the Magisterium](../events/a_warning_from_the_magisterium.md) happens</li></ul> | [Strengthen the Bloodline](#A15_strengthen_the_bloodlines)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_the_old_ways">The Old Ways</a><br />*With grapes and other crops growing constantly, our farms are producing like never before. The land, however, is starting to show the signs of magic taking its toll again and rumours are starting to spread beyond our borders of our suspicious production amounts. Our advisors have been gathered to determine a plan. The consensus was to build a series of estate run farms, laid out in the most spatially ideal way so as to maximize our usage of the land. This combined with a new field rotation regimen should not only allow us to keep pushing the land without magically overtaxing it too much, it will also give cause for the rumours to have some less suspicious backing in the form of revolutionary techniques and organization.* | <li>79:</li><ul><li>has manufactory trigger yes</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier eilisin_1_bad</li><li>has province modifier  eilisin_reduced_plant_growth</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>79:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = eilisin_1</li><li>remove province modifier = eilisin_1_bad</li><li>remove province modifier = eilisin_reduced_plant_growth</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eilisin_2</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Non-stop Growth](#A15_non_stop_growth)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_the_lesser_wine">The Lesser Wine</a><br />*With our firm hold over the Duchies of Rubenaire and Madelaire, their lesser wines are also in our grasp. We should consolidate the production of these other grapes in Eilísin to increase our control of wines in the Bay. It is no less than they would do were our positions reversed. Wine is everything in the Bay after all. Plus, we already have the infrastructure set up. This will allow us to control the amount of Rubenaire Red and Madelairey White so that it can never overtake our own Eilísin Tríros.* | <li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of 108</li><li>owns or non sovereign subject of  114</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is tooltip_has_transmutation_2</li><li>has ruler flag [transmutation_2](../flags/transmutation_2.md)</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = -100</li><li>108:</li><ul><li>add base production = -2</li></ul><li>114:</li><ul><li>add base production = -2</li></ul><li>79:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = eilisin_2</li><li>add base production = 4</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eilisin_3</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Old Ways](#A15_the_old_ways)<br /> |
| <a name="A15_vineyards_of_life_mission">Vineyards of Life</a><br />*Now that our power is sufficient and the mages are with us, we can put their plan into action. We are going to transfer life itself out of people and into the soil. This will, in theory, rejuvenate it with life energy and thus bypass the time required for it to recover naturally. This process will, of course, kill thousands but that is a small price to pay considering the benefits this will bring us.* | <li>estate loyalty:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>loyalty is at least 60</li></ul><li>estate influence:</li><ul><li>estate is estate_mages</li><li>influence is at least 66</li></ul><li>manpower is at least 5</li><li>79:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_1</li><li>has province modifier  magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_2</li><li>has province modifier   magic_realm_transmutation_plant_growth_3</li></ul></ul> | <li>add manpower = -5</li><li>79:</li><ul><li>remove province modifier = eilisin_3</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eilisin_4</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>increase witch king points small = yes</li> | [The Lesser Wine](#A15_the_lesser_wine)<br />[Reshaping the World](#A15_reshaping_the_world)<br /> |

| <a name="A15_crush_the_rebels">Crush the Rebels</a><br />*After the death of Duke Devan III at the Battle of the Moon Council in 1422, our nation has been shaky at best. His eldest son Duke Erlan II took the throne but had to continue the fight against Lorent as the Fourth Lilac War was still raging. This left his brother Galen and his cousin Tomas to their wiles, gaining support for their bids for the Duchy among the various nobles at court. There was one however that was more clever than the rest. The Duke’s youngest child, Réanna, spent much time with the advisors in court, away from the nobles and their scheming. The advisors were quite fond of her curious mind, many of them having tutored her throughout her childhood in some subject or other. Recently she has been requesting instruction in politics and political theory, a strange topic for one so young.\n\nWith the death of Duke Erlan II in 1437 in a skirmish with Lorent, the scramble for the Duchy began. Tomas had built a strong support in the nobility by promising to secede from the War that was costing them so much in both coin and manpower. His influence was such that when Galen was found mysteriously dead in his quarters he was able to take the regency for his ‘dear young cousin’ Réanna. Of course he immediately began attempting to consolidate power in order to seize the throne itself. Réanna learned of this from her advisors and with them devised a plan to overthrow her regency even at her young age. The plan succeeded but not without many of her cousin’s followers fleeing back to their other allies. Now is time to consolidate our control and make way for the restoration of Eilísin under Réanna’s well counselled rule.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is seize_crownland</li><li>has country flag [recent_land_seizure](../flags/recent_land_seizure.md)</li></ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>num of rebel armies is at least 1</li></ul> | <li>change estate land share:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>share = -15</li></ul><li>add estate influence modifier:</li><ul><li>estate = estate_nobles</li><li>desc = EST_VAL_CRUSHED_EILISIN_REBELS</li><li>influence = -10</li><li>duration = 7300</li></ul><li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = noble_rebels</li><li>size = 2</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>spawn rebels:</li><ul><li>type = noble_rebels</li><li>size = 1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>add stability or adm power = yes</li> |  |
| <a name="A15_ordoin_contacts">Ordóin Contacts</a><br />*As the de jure owner of Ordóin, lost to us for being on the losing side of the Lilac Wars, we still have loyal agents there, awaiting our orders, eager to be reunited with their country. Not enough of them to overthrow the county of course, but enough to destabilize it, surely, and prepare our way.* | <li>20:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>value is at least 50</li><li>this nation</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>20:</li><ul><li>add province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = eilisin_ordoin_contacts</li><li>duration = 18250</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = eilisin_ordoin_rebel</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If does not have owned by is ROOT:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>add spy network from:</li><ul><li>value = -50</li><li>who = ROOT</li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Protect Carneter](#A15_protect_carneter)<br /> |

The emperor has already accepted our claims to Woodwell in exchange for partial fealty and assistance in pushing his motions forward. Let us send an Ultimatum to Woodwell telling them that we will spare their leaders if they surrender now and swear fealty to us as their de jure liege.

| <a name="A15_protect_carneter">Protect Carneter</a><br />*Our holdings in Carneteria are very isolated from us. We must do what we can to protect them and give them time for our armies to arrive, should they be needed there. A series of defenses and forts, manned by local garrisons of well trained troops in the county of Ilvandet would protect our holdings and watch over both the Lorentish and Saloreni borders.* | <li>31:</li><ul><li>has fort building trigger yes</li></ul><li>owns 31</li> | <li>country gets the modifier eilisin_defended_carnter for 50 years</li> |  |

We could use this to our advantage in making gains within the political sphere of the Empire.
