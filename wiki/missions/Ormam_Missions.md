| <a name="G50_silk_secrets">Steal the Secret of Silk</a><br />*For a long time, Kimánis was one of our main economic rivals; in particular, they had been able to keep that title thanks to their exclusive knowledge of silk production. With the chaos of the city's recent fall, we are closer than ever to being able to steal this well-kept secret.* | <li>owns core province 2738</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owns 2732</li></ul></ul><li>2732:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has spy network from:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>2732:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>change trade goods = silk</li></ul> | [Build Up the Harbour](#G50_build_up_the_harbour)<br /> |
| <a name="G50_trade_school">The Ormami Trade School</a><br />*One of the reasons we are able to maintain our trade hegemony is the fact that we have some of the best merchants in the region. However, one day they'll have to retire. We must make sure that they pass down their wisdom before that happens.* | <li>dip is at least 5</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 30</li><li>has building university</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ormam_trade_school until otherwise removed</li> | [Steal the Secret of Silk](#G50_silk_secrets)<br /> |

| <a name="G50_build_up_the_harbour">Build Up the Harbour</a><br />*Our harbour is the greatest among the kheionai, but other nations will always try to undercut us. Ormam must never stop growing if we are to keep ahead.* | <li>2738:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 25</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>2738:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="G50_invest_in_apikhoxi">Invest in Apikhoxí</a><br />*Apikhoxí holds a key position to control the eastern trade, with most of the trade having to pass through here first. Now that we hold the city directly, it would be wise to start investing heavily into the harbour and send over some of our merchants to teach Devandi traders.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>2680:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>2680:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li></ul><li>2680:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ormam_trade_investment</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Build Up the Harbour](#G50_build_up_the_harbour)<br /> |
| <a name="G50_the_city_of_the_gulf">The City of the Gulf</a><br />*The deep gulf in which Empkeios is located will be an essential point to channel the inland goods that will come from Devandi lands as we continue to colonize the lands. With it, the eastern trade truly will be in our hands.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>2595:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>2595:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li></ul><li>2595:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ormam_trade_investment</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [Invest in Apikhoxí](#G50_invest_in_apikhoxi)<br />[Seize Empkeios](#G50_seize_empkeios)<br /> |
| <a name="G50_port_to_the_east">Port to the East</a><br />*The Ameioni capital at last is in our hands. We shall end the isolation of the city, starting by redesigning the port to better accommodate mercantile vessels making the journey towards the Taychend.* | <li>treasury is at least 150</li><li>2620:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -150</li><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 3:</li><ul><li>2620:</li><ul><li>add center of trade level = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li></ul><li>2620:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ormam_trade_investment</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The City of the Gulf](#G50_the_city_of_the_gulf)<br />[Route to Taychend](#G50_route_to_taychend)<br /> |
| <a name="G50_the_wondrous_harbour_mission">The Wondrous Harbour</a><br />*Our great harbour stands as a symbol on the world stage, not only due to the innumerable merchant ships that go in and out everyday, but also as a neutral spot in which diplomats may safely reside and conduct talks, provided they pay the authorities, of course.* | <li>treasury is at least 500</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>development is at least 35</li><li>has building shipyard</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -500</li><li>2738:</li><ul><li>remove building = shipyard</li><li>add building = grand_shipyard</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ormam_wondrous_harbour</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Ormami Trade School](#G50_trade_school)<br />[Port to the East](#G50_port_to_the_east)<br /> |

| <a name="G50_build_merchant_fleet">Build Up Merchant Fleet</a><br />*To truly solidify our control over the Kheionai trade we will need a great number of merchant ships; with them, we can make others reliant on our traders to conduct large scale hauling operations.* | <li>num of light ship is at least 10</li> | <li>2595:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="G50_seize_empkeios">Seize Empkeios</a><br />*The Alecandi slave trade is not as profitable as it once used to be. The main reason for this is the large influx of new slaves coming from Devand. If we are to keep our hold on this trade we must seize their main funnel point: Empkeios.* | <li>2595:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier ormam_merchant_fleets for 25 years</li><li>2620:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>2525:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Build Up Merchant Fleet](#G50_build_merchant_fleet)<br /> |
| <a name="G50_route_to_taychend">Route to Taychend</a><br />*Ameion is our main obstacle towards the establishment of a secure route to Taychend; these exiles hold some of the greater cities along the coast. If they were under our control we would be in a significantly better position to send fleets towards the Taychend.* | <li>2620:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul><li>2525:</li><ul><li>country or non sovereign subject holds is this nation</li></ul> | <li>2520:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Seize Empkeios](#G50_seize_empkeios)<br /> |
| <a name="G50_trade_port_in_taychend">Trade Port in Taychend</a><br />*We now are lacking but one step to start our domination of the trade in the Taychend. We must acquire a beachhead on the coast of the region so that our merchants can safely travel from the Taychend to Alecand, with all main stops being under our control.* | <li>treasury is at least 250</li><li>2520:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -250</li><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>2520:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li></ul> | [Route to Taychend](#G50_route_to_taychend)<br /> |

| <a name="G50_the_degabhen_threat">The Degabhen Threat</a><br />*With the fall of Kimánis, Degakheion is arguably the most powerful of the Kheionai nations. Our holdings in Alecand are small but extremely profitable. Should we approach them diplomatically, we may be able to use them as guard dogs against our enemies in the region.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Degakheion</li><li>is rival is Degakheion</li></ul> | <li>2717:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>If has alliance with is G46:</li><ul><li>add trust:</li><ul><li>who = G46</li><li>value = 10</li><li>mutual = yes</li></ul></ul> |  |
| <a name="G50_control_the_slave_trade">Control the Slave Trade</a><br />*Anisíkheion and Empkeios are the key points towards the control of the eastern slave trade. Now that we have them under our control, the profit of the slave trade will flow directly towards our capital.* | <li>treasury is at least 200</li><li>2717:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul><li>2595:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>has trade building trigger yes</li></ul> | <li>add treasury = -200</li><li>If does not have province has center of trade of level is 1:</li><ul><li>2717:</li><ul><li>center of trade = 1</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add adm power = 50</li></ul><li>2717:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ormam_slave_market</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>2738:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = ormam_slave_market</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul> | [The Degabhen Threat](#G50_the_degabhen_threat)<br /> |
