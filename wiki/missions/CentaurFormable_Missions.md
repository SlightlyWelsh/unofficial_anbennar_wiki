| <a name="I89_the_burgeoning_storm">The Burgeoning Storm</a><br />*The storm has begun. Across the plains, more and more centaurs rally to our Caehn’s banner. Already, our armies are fighting with more zeal and determination than in all of our history. We are no longer a light breeze, now, we are a great wind!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_150_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier centaur_storm_1 until otherwise removed</li> |  |
| <a name="I89_the_growing_storm">The Growing Storm</a><br />*On and on, our storm continues to grow. Our horde grows yet larger, our soldiers stronger still, our lands extend further and further than ever before. No longer are we a mere wind, for now we are a great rainstorm!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_225_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 225</li></ul></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = centaur_storm_1</li><li>country gets the modifier centaur_storm_2 until otherwise removed</li> | [The Burgeoning Storm](#I89_the_burgeoning_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_the_expanding_storm">The Expanding Storm</a><br />*Further and further, our armies march. All who would, or could, stand before us, fall in their hundreds, and then in their thousands. Our storm is far from over, no longer are we but a drizzle, now, our rains are torrential!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_325_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 325</li></ul></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = centaur_storm_2</li><li>country gets the modifier centaur_storm_3 until otherwise removed</li> | [The Growing Storm](#I89_the_growing_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_the_spreading_storm">The Spreading Storm</a><br />*Larger and larger, our empire grows. No longer constrained to the plains, our Caehnate’s rule can be felt in lands which were mere myth decades ago. Our conquests seem only to continue, as our storm is no longer just rain and wind, but joined by thunder and lightning. Our torrential rains are now a thunderstorm!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_450_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 450</li></ul></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = centaur_storm_3</li><li>country gets the modifier centaur_storm_4 until otherwise removed</li> | [The Expanding Storm](#I89_the_expanding_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_the_thriving_storm">The Thriving Storm</a><br />*Greater and greater, our Caehnate becomes. Our storm not only survives, battering down its foes, but brings new life in its wake, new fields for our people to call home. We do not just conquer, we do not just make it one day after the other. Now, we thrive. Our storm has grown further, from a minuscule thunderstorm, to a towering cyclone!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_575_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 575</li></ul></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = centaur_storm_4</li><li>country gets the modifier centaur_storm_5 until otherwise removed</li> | [The Spreading Storm](#I89_the_spreading_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_the_rampaging_storm">The Rampaging Storm</a><br />*Stronger and stronger, our soldiers become, as entire empires bow down to the might of the Caehnate. We have truly become one of the greatest empires in the history of Halann, and yet, still there are more lands to conquer. No longer are we merely a cyclone, but a rampaging typhoon!* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_750_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 750</li></ul></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = centaur_storm_5</li><li>country gets the modifier centaur_storm_6 until otherwise removed</li> | [The Thriving Storm](#I89_the_thriving_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_the_eternal_storm">The Eternal Storm</a><br />*None stand before us. All who would have, have been slaughtered. There truly are no equals left to face the storm. Every army the world could throw at us has been sent, and it has been crushed in a relentless stampede. Our storm is no wind, no torrential rain, no thunder, no lightning, no cyclone, no typhoon. It is far, far more than that. It is eternal.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_1000_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 1000</li></ul></ul> | <li>remove country modifier = centaur_storm_6</li><li>country gets the modifier centaur_storm_7 until otherwise removed</li> | [The Rampaging Storm](#I89_the_rampaging_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_stallions_of_war">Stallions of War</a><br />*In countless battles, across countless battles, time and time again our armies have emerged triumphant. Yet, it is not by the might of the common centaur alone that victory is attained. Rather, for our Caehnate to succeed, great commanders must be able to lead our armies with confidence and skill. Some, from amongst our ranks, have shown remarkable skill and ability, both as soldiers and commanders. We shall bring them into our Caehn’s inner circle, forming a trusted council of advisors; the Stallions of War.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_battle_centaur_500_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is nbCharge</li><li>value is at least 500</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is win_rate_centaur_85_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is battleWinRate</li><li>value is at least 85</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier stallions_of_war until otherwise removed</li><li>the event [The Three Stallions of War](../events/the_three_stallions_of_war.md) happens</li> |  |

| <a name="I89_just_a_lake_stories">Just a Lake Story</a><br />*When we first came to these lands, exiled by the humans of the west, we found yet more humans to the east. These humans, however stood little chance before our clans on the wide, open plains. Fearful, they retreated to the islands of the north, leaving the plains to our ancestors. Yet now, a thousand years later, they think themselves safe. They think that their lakes and walls, their boats and soldiers, their so-called “federation” will protect them from the storm that is to come. We will happily show them the error of their ways.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Province 5123 is owned by this nation or its subjects</li><li>owns or subject of  5138</li></ul> | <li>custom tooltip = centaur_unlock_cb_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>set country flag [centaur_special_cb](../flags/centaur_special_cb.md)</li></ul> | [§OEye of the Storm§!](#I89_eye_of_the_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_wealth_requisition">Wealth Requisition</a><br />*We must admit, the cities these humans have built certainly are grand, with their great buildings, and hoards of treasure. In fact, many of our warriors were amazed at the sheer scale of these monuments of humanity, especially in comparison to the vast emptiness of our current home. As such, efforts must be made to destroy these monuments immediately, and bring the treasures hidden within back to our Caehnate’s heartlands.* | <li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all province:</li><ul><li>has terrain city_terrain</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is southern_isles_region</li><li>region  is northern_isles_region</li></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 5</li></ul> | <li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>area:</li><ul><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base tax = 2</li><li>add base manpower = 2</li></ul><li>add base tax = 1</li><li>add base production = 1</li><li>add base manpower = 1</li></ul><li>If forbidden lands superregion has terrain is city terrain, and  has country or subject holds is ROOT, and has region is southern isles region, and has region is northern isles region:</li><ul><li>add base tax = -2</li><li>add base production = -2</li><li>add base manpower = -1</li></ul> | [Just a Lake Story](#I89_just_a_lake_stories)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_southern_submission">The Southern Submission</a><br />*The southern half of the lands of the Triunic lakes are now firmly under our Caehn’s control. Whether subjugated, conquered, or slaughtered, all of the humans still alive in our lands have sworn fealty to us, leaving our armies free to turn northwards, and annihilate this federation once and for all.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>southern isles region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is centaur_disband_the_federation_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [disbanded_lake_federation](../flags/disbanded_lake_federation.md)</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>country gets the modifier centaur_southern_domination for 100 years</li> | [Wealth Requisition](#I89_wealth_requisition)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_disband_the_federation">§ODisband the Federation§!</a><br />*It is done. These islanders, who have so long fought against our armies, have been brought to submission. All that remains is to destroy whatever dreams of their unity they once had. The flimsy paper which binds their federation together will be razed, just like their farms, their cities, and their people. The lake sought to fight against the storm, and instead, it was swept away.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has global flag [lake_federation_formed](../flags/lake_federation_formed.md)</li></ul></ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is disband_the_federation_tooltip</li><li>has country flag [disbanded_lake_federation](../flags/disbanded_lake_federation.md)</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>southern isles region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul><li>northern isles region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_50_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 50</li></ul></ul></ul> | [The Southern Submission](#I89_southern_submission)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_bulwar_proper">Bulwar Proper</a><br />*This land we march through, on our journey to our ancient home, is far richer and more prosperous than we expected. We must relieve them of this burden. Our armies shall march west as well as north, and bring what they call Bulwar under the centaur yoke. Their Sura’el shall not save them; the storm will blot out the sun.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is bulwar_proper_region</li><li>region  is harpy_hills_region</li></ul><li>value is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add mil power = 250</li><li>If bulwar superregion does not have country or non sovereign subject holds is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Way Back Home](#I89_way_back_home)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_under_the_sun">§OUnder the Sun§!</a><br />*These lands, from the hills in the north, to the deserts of the south, to the riverlands in between, all are ours. Their temples to false gods, their monuments to forgotten priests, their cities and metropolises, all have been crushed under our hooves. Yet, this is far from the end of our conquests. Beneath the heat of endless sun, the storm obtains new vigor.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>superregion is bulwar_superregion</li><li>value is at least 150</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add mil power = 350</li><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_20_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 20</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Bulwar Proper](#I89_bulwar_proper)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_divine_wind">Divine Wind</a><br />*Our armies stand victorious in countless conflicts, unmarred by defeat even after all these years. Our Caehnate eclipses all others, leaving none to stand against us. Yet, we still abide by petty diplomacy, things like alliances, friendship, truces. But why should we? Why should scraps of paper and handshakes constrain our endless conquest? Well our conquests shall be constrained no more! After all, who needs diplomacy when you have an army like the Caehn’s?* | <li>hidden trigger:</li><ul><li>is not controlled by the AI</li></ul><li>num of continents is at least 4</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is war_won_centaur_75_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>nbWarWon is at least 75</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier divine_wind until otherwise removed</li> |  |

| <a name="I89_eye_of_the_storm">§OEye of the Storm§!</a><br />*From humble origins, our horde has grown. Once, we were but one of many clans roaming these lands, as we have done so for thousands of moons. Now, however, our hooves and hearts beat as one. We stand united under our great Caehn, as we stand united against all who would oppose us. The time is now, for the world to tremble, to fear us! A storm is coming, and soon, it shall engulf the world.* | <li>mil power is at least 100</li><li>adm power is at least 100</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li> | <li>If is not controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_25_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 25</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 50</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>add mil power = -100</li><li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add adm power = -100</li> |  |
| <a name="I89_subjugate_the_ogre">§OSubjugate the Ogres§!</a><br />*To our west, clinging to their mountains as a calf clings to its mother, lie the lands of the ogres. These great, cannibalistic warriors have forever clashed with the clans who approach their lands, seeing themselves as somehow equal to us. We shall free them of their delusions, pounding their lands to dust in the process. Their villages will burn. Their children will be slaughtered. The Caehn will reign supreme. Our storm will grow.* | <li>ogre mountains region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>Is held by this nation or its subjects</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_10_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 10</li></ul></ul></ul> | [§OEye of the Storm§!](#I89_eye_of_the_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_a_lonely_oasis">A Lonely Oasis</a><br />*To our south, where the plains give way to desert, lies a single oasis. The Serpent’s Gift. This land, though dry and barren beyond the oasis, is home to one crucial thing; a pass westwards. The great Serpentspine Mountains, which have so long separated us from our ancient homeland, will stop us no more. The storm moves south, so that it may move westward. * | <li>serpent gift region:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>invaders pass area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [§OConsolidate our Holdings§!](#I89_consolidate_our_holdings)<br /> |

| <a name="I89_ancestor_home">§OAncestor's Home§!</a><br />*This is it. We’re home. The Fey, who once cast us out, now fear and respect us. Those orcs and elves, mere squatters, have been driven out or subjugated. As our armies march through the glades, memories of a time long past seem to wash through them. A time of peace, of coexistence. Yet, the world we have inherited is not one of peace, nor one of friendship. It is one of war, of death, of the Caehnate. The storm engulfs our homeland, and rages ever onwards.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>superregion is deepwoods_superregion</li><li>value is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add mil power = 200</li><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_15_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 15</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Way Back Home](#I89_way_back_home)<br /> |

| <a name="I89_consolidate_our_holdings">§OConsolidate our Holdings§!</a><br />*Though our Caehn has been named leader of all centaurs, there are still some of our people who resist his destiny. We must consolidate the plains, bringing what few independent centaur clans under our ever-expanding banner. Negeal is coming, whether they like it or not. For their destiny is forever intertwined with ours, and destiny, as they say, is inevitable.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is east_forbidden_plains_region</li><li>region  is west_forbidden_plains_region</li></ul><li>value is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_10_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 10</li></ul></ul></ul><li>east forbidden plains region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>west forbidden plains region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>yyl moista region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [§OEye of the Storm§!](#I89_eye_of_the_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_back_on_our_track">Back on Track</a><br />*A thousand years ago, our people arrived in Yyl Moista, the Northern Forest, little more than scattered refugees. Now, we return to this land, not as those fleeing conquest, but as conquerors. Our paths shall be retread, and our armies shall head north, to show all who once wronged us the fury of the storm.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is yyl_moista_region</li><li>value is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier centaur_expansion for 50 years</li> | [§OConsolidate our Holdings§!](#I89_consolidate_our_holdings)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_the_northern_pass">The Northern Pass</a><br />*The endless snows, the dense trees, the vile swamps. This land is far from desirable, and yet, it is where the hated Castan Beastbane once forced our ancestors to flee. Now, however, the pass shall serve a new purpose. A great highway, for our forces to march northwards, and to come down upon Castanor with a fury like no other. Remain ignorant, oh humans, in your precious towns and cities. The storm is coming, to leave only vengeance and destruction in its wake.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is northern_pass_region</li><li>value is at least 20</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>add mil power = 100</li><li>southern giants tears area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>vrorenwall area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>ebonmarck area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Back on Track](#I89_back_on_our_track)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_deja_vu">Déjà Vu</a><br />*The time has come. Our revenge is at hand. Our armies have finally reached the very gates of Escann itself. Yet, what we find is not the empire that once drew us away, for it seems that Castanor is long dead, our vengeance stolen from us by these so-called orcs. No matter. Orc or human, they’ll all look the same once their bones have been trampled into dust.* | <li>southern giants tears area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>vrorenwall area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>ebonmarck area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 15</li><li>west castanor region:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul><li>inner castanor region:</li><ul><li>add claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Northern Pass](#I89_the_northern_pass)<br /> |

We have, in mere decades, avenged a millennia-old injustice. Those who once oppressed us, who killed us, who expelled us, now look upon us with fear in their eyes. Their homes burn. Their cities crumble. Their people die. And yet, our vengeance is just beginning.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li><li>region  is inner_castanor_region</li></ul><li>value is at least 50</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 20</li><li>add mil power = 250</li><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_15_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 15</li></ul></ul></ul> | [Déjà Vu](#I89_deja_vu)<br /> |

Only then, once the land has been swept clean, will it be returned to its proper place. Under the dominion of centaurkind. Through fire and blood, in Escann, the storm shall be reborn anew.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>region is west_castanor_region</li><li>region  is inner_castanor_region</li><li>region   is south_castanor_region</li></ul><li>value is at least 150</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>add mil power = 350</li><li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_25_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 25</li></ul></ul></ul><li>the event [The Vengeance of One Thousand Years](../events/the_vengeance_of_one_thousand_years.md) happens</li> | [§OBreak Castan's Spine§!](#I89_break_castan_spine)<br />[§OAncestor's Home§!](#I89_ancestor_home)<br /> |

Beyond the southern mountains, lie a group who call themselves the Jadd, whose cavalry hordes seem almost a match for our own. Almost. We will train, we will drill, and ensure our armies the mightiest the world has yet seen. Then, we shall ride south, and overwhelm the Jaddari in endless storm.* | <li>has global modifier value:</li><ul><li>which is cavalry_power</li><li>value is at least 0.3</li></ul> | <li>If does not have country flag is [centaur_no_zeal](../flags/centaur_no_zeal.md):</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = centaur_zeal_5_tooltip</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>centaur zeal = 5</li></ul></ul></ul><li>far salahad region:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [§OConsolidate our Holdings§!](#I89_consolidate_our_holdings)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_twilight">Twilight</a><br />*The light of the Jadd has been extinguished. The last of the desert elves have been subjugated. The golden highway is now trod upon by endless centaur legions. WIth the crossroads of the world under our control, our Caehnate is free to march ever onwards. The storm engulfs the light, and it is far from satisfied.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>region is far_salahad_region</li><li>value is at least 15</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 10</li> | [§OFace the Desert Elves§!](#I89_face_the_desert_elves)<br /> |
| <a name="I89_the_tiger_pride">§OThe Tiger Pride§!</a><br />*To the east, beyond the deserts, lies Rahen, an empire greater than any other we have yet seen, at least in terms of size and wealth. Practically, however, it is mired in corruption, internal conflict, and disunity. In other words, ripe for conquest. Our armies shall cross into their jungles in untold numbers, and soon enough, our Caehn shall stand before a palace in Dhenjinsar. Then they shall raze it to rubble.

| <a name="I89_four_legged_tide">Four Legged Tide</a><br />*The orcs have long been the terror of the humans of the west, destroying our ancient foe of Castanor. They are a warlike race, relishing in the thrill of battle and the glory of war. In many ways they are kindred spirits to centaurkind. As such, they will surely present a worthy foe! May the battlefields run red with the blood of centaur and orc blood, as their tide clashes with our own! Of course, the victor of these conflicts will obviously be us.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is centaur_battle_orc_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>nbBattleOrc is at least 30</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier centaur_battle_orc until otherwise removed</li> |  |

Yet, these upstarts seem to think that they can face us on equal footing, throw us off as they have thrown off the dwarves and orcs. No matter.

Yet, what else do they have? Their bodies are short and frail, not even capable of taking on a halfling, let alone a mighty centaur.

It is clear to us, however, that all that comes of age and elven magic is decadence. We must put these decrepit old fools in their place once and for all, and teach them that wisdom and magic are nothing in comparison to the thunder of hooves.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is centaur_battle_elf_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>nbBattleElf is at least 75</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier centaur_battle_elf until otherwise removed</li> |  |

Yet, is that truly an advantage, when each new kobold sent to the battlefield will simply be yet another corpse beneath the stampede?

Once, they lead the greatest empires Haless has ever seen. Yet, all that is now in the past; the harimari are a mere shadow of their former selves, their empires crumbling with age. Where there empires once stood, we shall build a new one, to make the empire of Harimar’s empire a mere footnote in the history of the centaur conquest of Haless.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is centaur_battle_harimari_tooltip</li><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>nbBattleHarimari is at least 50</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier centaur_battle_harimari until otherwise removed</li> |  |
