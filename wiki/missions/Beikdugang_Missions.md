| <a name="Y15_vast_coast">The Vast Coast</a><br />*Beyond the deserts of the barbaric bird-riders lies a great expanse of forests, with a people even less organized but even less threatening. To us knowledge of their home is the first coastline frontier for us to explore on our path to discover the Federation upon the lakes.* | <li>moduk region:</li><ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul> | <li>add permanent claim = 4990</li><li>add permanent claim = 5419</li><li>country gets the modifier Y15_north_exploration for 20 years</li> | [Beyond the Horizon](#Y15_beyond_horizon)<br /> |
| <a name="Y15_journeys_rest">Journey's Rest</a><br />*These northern lands are wide, but not untamable. Establishing an outpost at the tip of this landmass will prove critical to establishing a proper trade route between the peoples of Zhuhan and Beikdugang. In addition, this can serve as a means to trade with the locals.* | <li>owns core province 4990</li><li>treasury is at least 100</li> | <li>add treasury = -100</li><li>4990:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_northern_post</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>If jerkikal area does not have core is ROOT; and does not have permanent claim is ROOT:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [The Vast Coast](#Y15_vast_coast)<br /> |
| <a name="Y15_the_horizon">The Horizon</a><br />*Just as we left our horizon and ventured North, we now emerge from the horizon of the Federation, the land of Zhuhan and the peoples like her. For years the Treasure Fleet has come to our ports, and now our own ships shall arrive in theirs.\n\nWhile the journey could be considered a mere ride on a boat, to many it is as though we have entered an entirely different world. This world contains both new friends to trade with and horrors to behold.* | <li>5226:</li><ul><li>has discovered this nation</li></ul><li>dip power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -50</li><li>the event [Contact](../events/contact.md) happens</li> | [Journey's Rest](#Y15_journeys_rest)<br /> |
| <a name="Y15_embassy_beyond">Embassy from Beyond</a><br />*The lands around the Lake Federation are swarmed with vicious Centaurs that are eager to tear down any semblance of civilization. Despite this, the peoples of the lake seek to claim these territories.\n\nAs peoples who also claim descent from these lands, we ought to stake a claim for ourselves. Where they build new homes for themselves, we will build a port to reconnect them to the outside world.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>5217:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>is city</li><li>is a colony</li></ul><li>5222:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>is city</li><li>is a colony</li></ul><li>zuurzoi area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>is city</li><li>is a colony</li></ul><li>zoitalzar area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>is a colony</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul></ul></ul><li>zurkalga area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>is a colony</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>5221:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>5217:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 5</li></ul><li>5222:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 5</li></ul><li>zuurzoi area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 5</li></ul><li>zoitalzar area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 5</li></ul><li>zurkalga area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 5</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li></ul> | <li>If does not have owned by is ROOT; and 5217 is city, and 5217 is a colony; and  does not have owned by is ROOT; and 5222 is city, and 5222 is a colony; and  has zuurzoi area has type is all, and does not have owned by is ROOT; and zuurzoi area is city, and zuurzoi area is a colony; and  has zoitalzar area has type is all, and does not have owned by is ROOT; and is city, and is a colony, and does not have port; and  has zurkalga area has type is all, and does not have owned by is ROOT; and is city, and is a colony, and does not have port:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>5221:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul><li>remove core = owner</li><li>cede province = ROOT</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_northern_post</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>custom tooltip = Y15_new_port</li><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If random owned province has area is zuurzoi area, and has area is zoitalzar area, and has area is zurkalga area, and has province id is 5217, and has province id is 5222; and  has owned by is ROOT, and  is core is ROOT, and  has port, and  has development is 5:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_northern_post</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [The Horizon](#Y15_the_horizon)<br /> |
| <a name="Y15_another_coast">Another Coast</a><br />*Past the Federation, there is a population of humans in great northern forests who worship spirits within this forest. This has piqued interest from scholars who travel with the merchant fleets to study the Federation's peoples.\n\nEstablishing an outpost among these people will further enable us to trade with the Federation, and provide our scholars access to this strange custom.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>yyl moitsa east area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>is a colony</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul></ul></ul><li>eternal winter area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>is city</li><li>is a colony</li><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has port</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>5010:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 200</li></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>yyl moitsa east area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 5</li></ul><li>eternal winter area:</li><ul><li>owned by is this nation</li><li>is core is this nation</li><li>has port</li><li>development is at least 5</li></ul></ul><li>treasury is at least 100</li></ul> | <li>If has yyl moitsa east area has type is all, and does not have owned by is ROOT; and is city, and is a colony, and does not have port; and  has eternal winter area has type is all, and does not have owned by is ROOT; and is city, and is a colony, and does not have port:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -200</li><li>5010:</li><ul><li>owner:</li><ul><li>add treasury = 100</li></ul><li>remove core = owner</li><li>cede province = ROOT</li><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_northern_post</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>add treasury = -100</li><li>custom tooltip = Y15_new_port</li><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>If random owned province has area is yyl moitsa east area, and has area is eternal winter area; and  has owned by is ROOT, and  is core is ROOT, and  has port, and  has development is 5:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_northern_post</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | [Embassy from Beyond](#Y15_embassy_beyond)<br />[Northern Lights](#Y15_northern_lights)<br /> |
| <a name="Y15_cultural_ties">Cultural Ties</a><br />*We have learned much from the Treasure Fleets visiting from Zhuhan, but their Federation holds peoples of other customs and other goddesses.

| <a name="Y15_goods_purse">Goods to Purse Faction</a><br />*The Federation has organized itself in order to better combat the centaurs that plague them. One group, the Purse faction, the economic wing of the Federation, exists to fund the war efforts. While we are not part of the Federation and have no obligation to contribute, sending economic aid regardless will earn us great favor from the Federation, and let them view us as their own.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y15_LAKE_factions</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has global flag [lake_the_place_of_everyone](../flags/lake_the_place_of_everyone.md)</li><li>exists is Lake Federation</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Lake Federation</li></ul></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all country:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y15_gifted</li><li>has country modifier lake_federation_member</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>modifier is sent_gift</li><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 20</li></ul></ul></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>J33:</li><ul><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y15_gifted_fed</li><li>has opinion modifier:</li><ul><li>modifier is sent_gift</li><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 4</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add republican tradition = 5</li><li>add war exhaustion = -2</li><li>If every country has country modifier is lake federation member, and has tag is J33:</li><ul><li>add war exhaustion = -2</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = Y15_LF_refugees</li><li>set global flag [JY_LF_refugees](../flags/jy_lf_refugees.md)</li> | [Cultural Ties](#Y15_cultural_ties)<br />[Trade Ties](#Y15_trade_ties)<br /> |
| <a name="Y15_guns_sword">Guns to Sword Faction</a><br />*The other wing of the Federation, the Sword faction, exists to physically send soldiers into battle against the centaurs. While there is considerable distance between the centaurs and ourselves, they are ultimately a threat to all of humanity, and we owe it to our brethren on the frontlines to send men armed with guns to help them fend off this threat.* | <li>manpower is at least 20</li><li>faction in power is mr_aristocrats</li><li>mil is at least 4</li><li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is Y15_fed_centaur</li><li>hidden trigger:</li><ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>technology group is tech_centaur</li><li>any country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has country modifier lake_federation_member</li><li>Country is Lake Federation</li></ul><li>war with is PREV</li></ul></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add manpower = -20</li><li>add republican tradition = 5</li><li>add prestige = 10</li><li>If every country has country modifier is lake federation member, and has tag is J33:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Y15_help_abroad for 15 years</li></ul><li>add historical friend = J33</li><li>J33:</li><ul><li>add historical friend = ROOT</li></ul><li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>4907:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = Y15_J33_friends</li></ul></ul> | [Goods to Purse Faction](#Y15_goods_purse)<br /> |
| <a name="Y15_naval_training">Joint Naval Training</a><br />*We have traditionally already exchanged maritime knowledge with our counterparts in the Federation. However, this tradition has not kept up with the rapidly developing oceanic developments our nation is going through, and has largely relied on texts exchanged by the Treasure Fleet.\n\nPerforming naval exercises directly within the Federation's waters will reignite cooperation between our two admiralities.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Lake Federation</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Lake Federation</li><li>value is at least 90</li></ul></ul><li>else if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has idea group maritime_ideas</li><li>has idea group  naval_ideas</li></ul><li>culture group is triunic</li></ul></ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has idea group maritime_ideas</li><li>has idea group  naval_ideas</li></ul><li>culture group is triunic</li><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 90</li></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>any known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 90</li></ul><li>culture group is triunic</li></ul></ul><li>4226:</li><ul><li>heavy ships in province is this nation</li><li>heavy ships in province  is at least 5</li><li>light ships in province is this nation</li><li>light ships in province  is at least 10</li></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owns 4908</li></ul></ul><li>owns 4908</li></ul><li>dip is at least 5</li><li>dip power is at least 100</li><li>mil power is at least 50</li> | <li>add dip power = -100</li><li>add mil power = -50</li><li>add navy tradition = 20</li><li>4908:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_naval_exchange</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = Y15_naval_joint</li><li>If has exists is J33:</li><ul><li>J33:</li><ul><li>add navy tradition = 20</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_naval_exchange</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>Else if has has idea group is maritime ideas, and has idea group is naval ideas; and any known country has culture group is triunic:</li><ul><li>If random known country has idea group is maritime ideas, and has idea group is naval ideas; and  has culture group is triunic, and  has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 90:</li><ul><li>add navy tradition = 20</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_naval_exchange</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>If random known country has opinion has who is ROOT, and has opinion has value is 90; and  has culture group is triunic:</li><ul><li>add navy tradition = 20</li><li>capital scope:</li><ul><li>add permanent province modifier:</li><ul><li>name = Y15_naval_exchange</li><li>duration = -1</li></ul></ul></ul></ul><li>custom tooltip = Y15_last_stand_t</li> | [Guns to Sword Faction](#Y15_guns_sword)<br />[Volcanic Base](#Y15_volcanic_base)<br /> |

Being surrounded on all sides by hostile centaurs has taken a toll on their culture, and for the most part their only friend on the world stage has been us.\n\nNo matter, we shall reaffirm this friendship across the entire federation so that they know they are not truly alone, and that any future diplomats representing the Federation will be welcomed freely in our courts, and assisted in contacting others.* | <li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>exists is Lake Federation</li></ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Lake Federation</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul></ul><li>else:</li><ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 60</li></ul><li>primary culture is zabatlari</li></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 60</li></ul><li>primary culture is khamgunai</li></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul><li>calc true if:</li><ul><li>all known country:</li><ul><li>has opinion:</li><ul><li>this nation</li><li>value is at least 60</li></ul><li>primary culture is metsamic</li></ul><li>amount is at least 3</li></ul></ul><li>if:</li><ul><li>limit:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>owns 4909</li></ul></ul><li>owns 4909</li></ul><li>dip is at least 4</li> | <li>hidden effect:</li><ul><li>country gets the modifier Y15_culture_temp for 31 days</li></ul><li>add accepted culture = zabatlari</li><li>add accepted culture = khamgunai</li><li>add accepted culture = metsamic</li><li>custom tooltip = Y15_friends_triunic</li><li>4909:</li><ul><li>add province triggered modifier = beikdugang_triunic</li></ul><li>custom tooltip = Y15_LF_advisors</li><li>set global flag [JY_LF_advisors](../flags/jy_lf_advisors.md)</li> | [Joint Naval Training](#Y15_naval_training)<br /> |

Almost every merchant in the nation knows at least one of the Triunic languages, many of our citizens dress in clothes either made in the Federation or in their style.
