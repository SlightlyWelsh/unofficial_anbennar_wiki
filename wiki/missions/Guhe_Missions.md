| <a name="guhe_centralized_defense">A Centralized Defense</a><br />*The League is on the verge of collapse, even if few will openly say it. Years of complacency left our alliance utterly incapable of facing the growing threat to our north, and the loss at Yaocing is a testament to that. As the great river is reddened by Yanszin's blood, growing threats find themselves ever more emboldened by the opportunity to pounce. \n\nA new strategy must be adopted - one where the League needs not rely on the neglected and ill-managed armies of our sister-states but rather on a strong, centralized military with Guhe at its head.* | <li>num of cities is at least 3</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y10</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>Y10:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y08</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>Y08:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y06</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>Y06:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul><li>OR:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y04</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>Y04:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul> | <li>set country flag [guhe_allow_central](../flags/guhe_allow_central.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = guhe_central_tt</li><li>Y10:</li><ul><li>the event [The Yanszin Army](../events/the_yanszin_army.md) happens</li></ul><li>Y08:</li><ul><li>the event [The Yanszin Army](../events/the_yanszin_army.md) happens</li></ul><li>Y06:</li><ul><li>the event [The Yanszin Army](../events/the_yanszin_army.md) happens</li></ul><li>Y04:</li><ul><li>the event [The Yanszin Army](../events/the_yanszin_army.md) happens</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="guhe_strategic_ed">Strategic Education</a><br />*Even as the League falls ever closer to peril, the great school of Yangcheng is ever hesitant to commit to decisive action. Even now, as threats loom from all directions, they prioritize studying old tomes and petty politics. \nOur place as the de facto military of the League has gained us a certain degree of influence over our sister cities - particularly Yangcheng, who has always been a weak link in our armed forces. With a small application of pressure, we may be able to secure a greater education for our growing officer corps.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Y06</li><li>value is at least 2</li></ul><li>Y06:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier guhe_strat_ed for 10 years</li> | [A Centralized Defense](#guhe_centralized_defense)<br />[Another Storm to Bear](#guhe_another_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="guhe_yanzhong_aid">Demand Yanzhong Aid</a><br />*Of all our allies, Yanzhong has been the most tiresome to deal with in matters of our new military. Citing hyperbolic issues of manpower, the centralized Yanszin forces are repeatedly called on by the trade city to solve matters beneath even a common guardsman. \nIf they wish to lean on our military to this extreme, we must ensure that they will pay proportionately. * | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army strength:</li><ul><li>Y08</li><li>value is at least 3</li></ul><li>Y08:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier guhe_demand_aid for 15 years</li><li>4976:</li><ul><li>add building construction:</li><ul><li>building = fort_15th</li><li>speed = 1</li><li>cost = 0</li></ul></ul> | [Strategic Education](#guhe_strategic_ed)<br />[Favorable Ground](#guhe_favorable_ground)<br /> |

| <a name="guhe_another_storm">Another Storm to Bear</a><br />*Our duty, above all else, is to protect the Yanszin from those who would do her harm. Unfortunately, in these days there are a glut of those who would gladly take her lands for itself. Even now, with no small number of hungry neighbors eyeing our lands, rumors of a new threat emerge from the north. Emissaries must be sent abroad to learn more of this, and to determine what course we must take to prepare.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>reverse has opinion:</li><ul><li>Y16</li><li>value is at least 100</li></ul><li>Y16:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier guhe_storm for 15 years</li><li>the event [Making Ready](../events/making_ready.md) happens</li> |  |
| <a name="guhe_favorable_ground">Favorable Ground</a><br />*Few among our armies wish to do battle with the Kobolds, and even fewer among them have any great grievance with us. Nonetheless, control of the mountain pass is crucial for the defense of the League. They must bow - even if by force.* | <li>owns 4976</li> | <li>add government reform = guhe_council_stripes_reform</li> | [Another Storm to Bear](#guhe_another_storm)<br /> |
| <a name="guhe_tighten_noose">Tighten The Noose</a><br />*There was a hope, when we first embarked on this great project, that by freeing the League from the burdens of an army they would be able to pursue their own strengths. That the scholars of Yangcheng would grow to new heights of discovery, or that the people of Yingzhen would finally find some niche in our alliance. Instead, it seems that they have only grown complacent. The merchants of Yanzhong treat themselves to ever more grand leisures, and the zealots of Anjiang have only fallen deeper into their reliance on the far-off seers. \n\nThere can only be one path forward - we must either right the course of the Yanszin, or we will surely fall just as the rest surely will. The time has come for drastic measures.* | <li>custom trigger tooltip:</li><ul><li>tooltip is guhe_noose_tt</li><li>variable arithmetic trigger:</li><ul><li>export to variable:</li><ul><li>which is guhe_army_size</li><li>value is army_size</li><li>this nation</li></ul><li>export to variable:</li><ul><li>which is enemy_army_size</li><li>value is army_size</li><li>Y08</li></ul><li>export to variable:</li><ul><li>which is yangcheng_army_size</li><li>value is army_size</li><li>Y06</li></ul><li>change variable:</li><ul><li>which is enemy_army_size</li><li>which  is yangcheng_army_size</li></ul><li>multiply variable:</li><ul><li>which is enemy_army_size</li><li>value is at least 2.5</li></ul><li>check variable:</li><ul><li>which is guhe_army_size</li><li>which  is enemy_army_size</li></ul></ul></ul><li>Y06:</li><ul><li>is not at war</li></ul><li>Y08:</li><ul><li>is not at war</li></ul> | <li>If has Y06 is controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>inherit = Y06</li></ul><li>If has Y08 is controlled by the AI:</li><ul><li>inherit = Y08</li></ul><li>the event [Assuming Direct Control](../events/assuming_direct_control.md) happens</li><li>clr country flag [guhe_allow_central](../flags/guhe_allow_central.md)</li> | [Favorable Ground](#guhe_favorable_ground)<br />[Demand Yanzhong Aid](#guhe_yanzhong_aid)<br />[A Shared Front](#guhe_shared_front)<br /> |
| <a name="guhe_master_yanszin">Master of Yanszin</a><br />*The Yanszin must be united if any of us are to survive the struggles that are to come. No longer can we suffer the infighting and politicking of the old League. No longer can we put our own safety in the hands of other states. \n\nThe Yanszin will meet her future together, be it our rise or our fall.* | <li>original yanszin:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul> | <li>add prestige = 30</li><li>country gets the modifier guhe_master for 20 years</li> | [Tighten The Noose](#guhe_tighten_noose)<br /> |

| <a name="guhe_shared_front">A Shared Front</a><br />*Between us and the beleaguered Jiantsiang are the great farmlands of Ningxiang, as prosperous as they are vulnurable. The lands are ripe for invasion either by us or the northern menace, and common opinion among the officers is that such lands will be far harder to defend than the mountain-protected heartlands. However, should we formalize relations with Jianstiang, our combined may should prove capable of keeping the foe at bay.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>alliance with is Y16</li><li>is rival is Y16</li><li>is enemy is Y16</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier guhe_front for 20 years</li><li>ningxiang area:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = ROOT</li></ul> | [Favorable Ground](#guhe_favorable_ground)<br /> |
| <a name="guhe_northern_wall">The Northern Wall</a><br />*Conventional military wisdom regarding the Shuuvish is that the open field belongs to the enemy. Hardier than any horse (to say nothing of their beaks), Yanshen cavalry cannot hope to match the riders. Therefore, the key lies in denying them these advantages. Protracted sieges and rough terrain both serve to stifle their advance, and while our recent acquisitons in Ningxiang will never prove quite as defensive as the mountains we can at least mitigate the issue with proper fortifications.* | <li>balrijin area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>ningxiang area:</li><ul><li>type is all</li><li>owned by is this nation</li></ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.2</li> | <li>country gets the modifier guhe_faith for 20 years</li> | [A Shared Front](#guhe_shared_front)<br /> |
| <a name="guhe_cat_bird">The Cat and The Bird</a><br />*Even if we were to spend every coin in the world on the defenses against the north, the threat can only ever be abated with a proper and decisive victory. \n\nThere can be no other solution. So long as the hordes of Nuugdan Tsarai assail our gates, we will only ever be a moment of weakness away from defeat. When the time is right, we must take the fight to their lands.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>has won war against:</li><ul><li>Y91</li><li>max years since is at least 200</li></ul><li>has won war against:</li><ul><li>Y96</li><li>max years since is at least 200</li></ul><li>has won war against:</li><ul><li>Y98</li><li>max years since is at least 200</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>Y91:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>Y96:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>Y98:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>add prestige = 25</li><li>set country flag [guhe_pulse](../flags/guhe_pulse.md)</li><li>custom tooltip = guhe_pulse_tt</li> | [The Northern Wall](#guhe_northern_wall)<br /> |
