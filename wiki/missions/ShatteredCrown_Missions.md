| <a name="H72_outlive_siegebreaker">Outlive Siegebreaker</a><br />*Word travels slow through the fractured Dwarovar, but it travels nontheless. Rumors have it that shortly after Korgus, the false prophet who blamed the humans for the sins of the dwarves, left for the surface, he sent a clan back into the dwarovar to gather reinforcements: The Siegebreaker clan. If the rumors are to be believed thousands of Black Orcs are answering the call, following the clans claim that Korgus has been enjoying initial success in his invasion of Escann. If we do not see these heretics destroyed, they might destroy us.* | <li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>exists is Siegebreaker</li></ul> | <li>add stability or adm power = yes</li><li>add church power = 100</li><li>If has any owned province has region is west dwarovar region, and any owned province has religion is great dookan:</li><ul><li>If every owned province has region is west dwarovar region, and  has religion is great dookan:</li><ul><li>change religion = old_dookan</li></ul></ul> | [Onto The Dwarovrod](#H72_onto_the_dwarovrod)<br /> |

| <a name="H72_fate_of_the_darkscales">Fate Of The Darkscales</a><br />*It seems the dwarves aren't the only adventurers who have wandered into our domain, kobolds have apparently their way in as well and have established a hovel. They are a strange bunch, reminiscent of goblins in many ways, perhaps we can make use of them.

| <a name="H72_legacy_of_korgus">Legacy Of Korgus</a><br />*When the Siegebreaker clan spread word through the Dwarovar that Korgus was winning but needed more men, we thought they might have been telling the truth. Now that we have established contact with the surface, it is clear that is not the case: He died to a human woman named Corin and his armies fractured back into clans who now fight one another as much as they fight the humans. Korgus has fallen, perhaps we can pick up the pieces.* | <li>owns core province 2863</li><li>owns core province  4553</li><li>owns core province   4552</li> | <li>If has exists is B25:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 3000</li><li>target = B25</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is B26:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 3000</li><li>target = B26</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is B24:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 3000</li><li>target = B24</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is B28:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 3000</li><li>target = B28</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is B30:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 3000</li><li>target = B30</li></ul></ul><li>If has exists is Z52:</li><ul><li>add casus belli:</li><ul><li>type = cb_vassalize_mission</li><li>months = 3000</li><li>target = Z52</li></ul></ul> | [Attract Escanni Settlers](#H72_attract_escanni_refugees)<br /> |

They have been arguing for weeks now, interpreting old wall painting, dwarven murals about their ancient war against us and oral traditions from the various clans we have subjugated. Opinions differ wildly, some shamans say we must bring the fight to the dwarven adventurers, others say we must wait for a sign whilst others say we must expediate our search for Dookan and free him.\n\nAll agree that we should hear out all Black Orc shamans we can find and secure safe access to holy sites in Verkal Vazkron and the Hall of the Ancestors.

When our ancestors, before they called themselves Shattered Crown, besieged, conquered and ultimately plundered it together with an alliance of other clans, hundreds upon hundreds of generations ago, its supply of mithril fractured quite a few clans as greed took them.\n\nOur clan however remembered our goal, the capital of the dwarven empire: Amldihr.\n\nNow, after all this time, we must take Mithradhûm once more, but a large clan of goblins, calling themselves Mountainsharks, stand in our way to Er-Natvir and dispute our ownership over Mithradhûm.

| <a name="H72_reunite_the_clans">Reunite The Clans</a><br />*According to some of our oldest legends, orcs were created as to be one single clan, united in its purpose to defeat the dwarves and free Dookan. But with such long tunnels, so many holds and so many greedy chieftains a split was inevitable. We should try to unify as many orcs in a single clan as we can, infighting should be a thing of the past.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is orcish</li><li>is subject of is this nation</li></ul><li>any country:</li><ul><li>culture group is orcish</li><li>alliance with is this nation</li></ul></ul> | <li>add church power = 50</li><li>add yearly manpower = 0.5</li><li>country gets the modifier H72_united_clans until otherwise removed</li> |  |
