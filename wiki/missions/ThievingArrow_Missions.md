| <a name="g_a_clan_embattled">A Clan Embattled</a><br />*There are many would be contenders for goblin supremacy in the Serpentreach and we have been fighting them all for a long time. Our armies are becoming used to these fights and the more we win the more we learn. We have begun to use these lessons to defeat our rivals and our armies are coming out further and further on top.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>army professionalism is at least 0.03</li><li>army tradition is at least 16</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_serpentreach_fights for 10 years</li> |  |
| <a name="g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go">Skomdihr Way We Go</a><br />*We have come to realize that, if we are to solidify our hold on the Serpentsreach, we’ll need a hold to solidify. The nearby hold of Verkal Skomdihr should do nicely, once we get it fixed up of course.* | <li>is not at war</li><li>owns core province 4100</li><li>4100:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>has province modifier ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier  partially_ruined_hold</li><li>has province modifier   damaged_hold</li></ul></ul> | <li>set capital = 4100</li><li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_skomdihr_claiming for 15 years</li> | [A Clan Embattled](#g_a_clan_embattled)<br /> |
| <a name="g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place">Garnet and Diamond</a><br />*Now that we’ve secured and fixed up our new hold, we’ve been able to organize scouting parties to map out the Serpentreach. There seem to be several dwarven threats building up from the old holds of Ovdal Lodhum and Arg-Ôrdstun, putting us in a very dangerous situation. If we are to maintain this small hold we’ve carved out for ourselves, we’ll need them out of the way.* | <li>army size is at least 25</li><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>knows country is Ovdal Lodhum</li><li>knows country  is Arg-Ordstun</li><li>knows country   is Blackbeard Cartel</li><li>knows country    is Gor Burad</li></ul><li>All of the following:</li><ul><li>H77:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>H76:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>H71:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul><li>I16:</li><ul><li>does not exist</li></ul></ul></ul> | <li>H76:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = FROM</li></ul></ul><li>H77:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = FROM</li></ul></ul><li>H71:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = FROM</li></ul></ul><li>I16:</li><ul><li>every owned province:</li><ul><li>add permanent claim = FROM</li></ul></ul> | [Skomdihr Way We Go](#g_a_skomdihr_way_we_go)<br /> |
| <a name="g_hunting_blackbeard">Hunting Blackbeard</a><br />*While the other holds were a military threat to our new domain, the Blackbeard Cartel is something different altogether. Being a criminal organization long before they came back to the Dwarovar, they are used to operating from the shadows and maintaining a hold where they have no business doing so. While we may have dealt with them militarily, they will remain an unseen thorn in our side, undercutting our merchants and punishing our own cartels’ control until we have removed all dwarves from the Serpentreach.  Only then will they have no shadows left to hide in.* | <li>serpentreach region:</li><ul><li>None of the following:</li><ul><li>culture group is dwarven</li></ul><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>add adm power = 50</li><li>add prestige = 10</li> | [Garnet and Diamond](#g_between_a_garnet_and_a_diamond_hard_place)<br /> |
| <a name="g_the_masters_of_serpentreach">Masters of Serpentreach</a><br />*Finally, we have removed the last of the Blackbeard Cartel’s influence in the Serpentreach, captured the old remnant holds, and spread our control from Gor Bûrad to Orlghelovar. The Thieving Arrow clan is no more, for from now on we are the only ones left, the Usmaklan.* | <li>serpentreach region:</li><ul><li>owned by is FROM</li><li>type is all</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_thieving_arrow until otherwise removed</li><li>override country name = USMAKLAN</li> | [Hunting Blackbeard](#g_hunting_blackbeard)<br /> |

| <a name="g_wandering_into_woods">Wander Into Woods</a><br />*With our hold on the Serpentreach solidifying, perhaps it is time to go beyond the ruined Wardgate and venture into the Deepwoods. Though surely with such an impressive, albeit completely ruined and useless, gate to guard the entrance, there will be great dangers out there as well.  We must be prepared.* | <li>owns core province 3065</li> | <li>add prestige = 10</li><li>define advisor:</li><ul><li>type = commandant</li><li>name = "Colk Thieving Arrow"</li><li>skill = 1</li><li>culture = cave_goblin</li><li>religion = goblinic_shamanism</li><li>discount = yes</li></ul> |  |
| <a name="g_market_sap_untapped">Market Sap Untapped</a><br />*There is so much to be exploited in the Deepwoods, from the sap in the trees to the fur of the beasts that live beneath them. And of course, the trees themselves.\n\nYes, this was a fine plan. The wheels of our industry will never stop turning now.* | <li>owns 3035</li><li>owns  3032</li> | <li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_deepwood_dividends for 20 years</li> | [Wander Into Woods](#g_wandering_into_woods)<br /> |
| <a name="g_a_link_to_further_conquest">A Link To The Future</a><br />*We have found some old records and journals from the dwarves that once called Verkal Skomdihr home, detailing methods of survival, travel, and precaution when traversing the Deepwoods. Although many were lost, our scouts have finally been able to start working out how to navigate the paths between the major regions of the forest. Nothing stands in our way now.* | <li>Any of the following:</li><ul><li>owns 3063</li><li>owns  3050</li><li>owns   3049</li><li>owns    3053</li><li>owns     3059</li></ul> | <li>country gets the modifier cave_goblin_verdant_conquest for 20 years</li><li>define general:</li><ul><li>shock = 3</li><li>fire = 4</li><li>manuever = 4</li><li>siege = 0</li><li>name = "Zurgab Shadowfury"</li><li>trait = hardy_warrior_personality</li></ul> | [Market Sap Untapped](#g_market_sap_untapped)<br /> |
| <a name="g_deeper_into_the_deepwoods">Deeper into the Deepwoods</a><br />*Though there were a few scattered goblin clans and orcish tribes within the Deepwoods, we have become the dominant goblin presence here. The elves that remain will soon be no threat to us as our manufactories pump out arms and armour, fueled by a steady supply of Deepwoods wood and Serpentreach metal.* | <li>num of owned provinces with:</li><ul><li>value is at least 15</li><li>superregion is deepwoods_superregion</li></ul> | <li>add splendor = 100</li> | [A Link To The Future](#g_a_link_to_further_conquest)<br /> |
